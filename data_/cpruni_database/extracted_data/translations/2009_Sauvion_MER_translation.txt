Abstract

Cacopsylla pruni is the vector of European stone fruit yellows, a quarantine disease of
Prunus trees. Nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed from enriched
DNA libraries. Allelic variability was assessed in a collection of 149 females obtained from
five localities covering a large geographical area in France. The number of detected alleles
ranged from 8 to 37. Within the localities, observed and expected heterozygosities averaged

across loci ranged from 0.39 to 0.55, and from 0.68 to 0.81, respectively. A heterozygote
deficiency was detected for almost all loci, possibly due to a high null allele frequency. Other possible causes of the homozygote excess (mode of reproduction, inbreeding,
assortative mating or Wahlund effect) are discussed. These variable microsatellite loci can
provide tools to assess overall genetic variation in this important vector species. They will
be used to search for population structure and migration patterns of C. pruni. Keywords: blackthorn, disease, epidemiology, microsatellite, phytoplasma, psyllid

Received 17 October 2008; revision accepted 26 January 2009

The psyllid Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli) is a phloem-feeding
insect, which is widespread in Europe (from Finland to
Portugal), Caucasus and Siberia (Ossiannilsson 1992). This
psyllid is univoltine (having one generation per year),
develops on several species of Prunus (mainly on blackthorn
P. spinosa), and overwinters on conifers. In France, C. pruni
is widespread and common either on wild or cultivated
Prunus. Itis the vector of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’,
which causes European stone fruit yellows and damages
mainly apricot (P. armeniaca) and Japanese plum (P. salicina). The phytoplasma is mostly transmitted by insects infected
the previous year, on their return from overwintering
(Thébaud et al. 2009). To understand the processes underlying
disease spread, it is important to better estimate distance
and direction of the psyllid migratory flights. As these
cannot be directly followed, we aim at characterizing them
in an indirect way by analysing the genetic differentiation
among C. pruni populations. Microsatellites are usually
regarded as the most appropriate tool to study neutral
intraspecific genetic variation because of their high
mutation rate and hence high levels of polymorphism. Ten
microsatellite loci have been previously characterized in
the related species C. melanoneura (Malagnini et al. 2007),
but cross-priming tests in our laboratory with C. pruni
showed that eight were monomorphic and two showed
unclear multiband patterns. As a result, none of them was
suitable for genetic studies in C. pruni, and other markers had
to be found for this purpose. Here we report the isolation
and characterization of nine polymorphic microsatellite
loci from C. pruni. We performed microsatellite screening using Estoup &
Cornuet’s method (1994). Genomic DNA was isolated
using a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide protocol (Doyle
& Doyle 1987) from 10 pooled C. pruni females, collected
on P. spinosa near Saucliéres (France) on 5 December
2004, Total genomic DNA (~7 tig) was digested using Rsal
restriction enzyme. A 400-900 bp fraction of the digested
DNA was selected, purified and ligated to Rsa linkers. The enrichment procedure followed the protocol from
Kijas et al. (1994) based on streptavidin-coated magnetic
particules (Magnesphere, Promega), with slight modifications. The following 5'-biotinylated (CT) jo, (GT), (AAG) io,
(AAT), (TGTA) 9, and (ATCT), oligonucleotides were

used as probes. We amplified the enriched single-stranded
DNA using one of the Rsa linkers as a primer to obtain
more enriched product and to recover double-stranded
DNA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were
purified and ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega),
and the plasmid transformed into Escherichia coli super-
competent cell (XL1 blue, Stratagene). In total (all motifs
included), 1153 recombinant clones were cultivated onto
LB agar/ampicillin Petri dishes at 37 °C overnight. Each
E. coli colony was separately transferred on positively
charged Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham). DNA
was fixed on the membrane by heating at 80 °C for an hour. Positive colonies were identified by hybridization with
(CT), (GT)o, (AAG), (AAT) io, (TGTA) io, and (ATCT)
probes labelled with digoxigenin using the DIG Oligonu-
cleotide Tailing Kit (Roche Applied Science). A total of 253
positives clones were picked and stored in plates containing
glycerol at -80 °C. All of them were sequenced and 225
sequences were obtained, of which 218 contained repeated
units. Redundant clones were eliminated, leading to a set
of 140 unique sequences. For 42 sequences, several primer
pairs were successfully designed using the software Primer 3
(Rozen & Skaletsky 2000). New primers were first tested
using a single PCR per locus. Among the 42 loci tested, 12
provided good quality amplification products and were
retained for multiplex PCRs. The forward primer of each
locus was 5'-end labelled with a fluorescent dye (FAM,
HEX or DragonFly). Because of the high allele size variability,
no more than three loci were simultaneously analysed per
run. For each run, a single PCR was performed on a T-1
Thermoblock (Biometra) using the Multiplex PCR Kit
(QIAGEN). The multiplex PCRs were conducted in 10-"L
reaction volume containing the QIAGEN Multiplex PCR
Master Mix (1x) (including HotStar Taq, dNTPs and 3 mm
of MgCl, as final concentration), 0.2 um of each primer,
about 50 ng of genomic DNA, and RNAse-free water. All
multiplex PCRs started with an initial activation step at
95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles with denaturation
at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C (multiplex sets 1, 2 and
4) or 60 °C (multiplex set 3) for 90 s, extension at 72 °C for
60 s and final extension of 60 °C for 30 min. The PCR products
were sized on a MegaBace 1000 automated sequencer
(GE Healthcare). Screening for polymorphism and allele

Given are locus name and GenBank Accession no., primer sequences, repeated motif in cloned allele, and annealing temperature (T,). The
fluorescent-labelled primers are indicated by F (FAM), D (DragonFly) or H (HEX) at the 5'-end. For each locus, the allelic size range, number
of amplified alleles (V,), and observed and expected heterozygosities (Ho, H,) are given over all localities. scoring was performed using the Genetic Profiler software
version 1.5. Among 12 loci tested, one gave inconsistent
amplification, and two showed unclear multiband patterns. Finally, nine loci giving clear amplifications were chosen
for population analysis (Table 1). We tested these nine markers on 149 females of C. pruni,
sampled in five localities covering a large geographical
area in France: Torreilles (TOR, 42°45'18.35"N, 2°59'33.93"E),
Prades-le-Lez (PRA, 43°42'18.38"N, 3°51'12.41"E), La Tieule
(TIE, 44°23'12.57"N, 3°7'26.00"E), Coursegoules (COU,
43°47'45.12"N, 7°2'54.56"E), and Montgamé (MON,
46°44'3.89"N, 0°30'35.52"E). Thirty females per locality
were genotyped except for TOR and MON where 27 and 32
females, respectively, had been sampled. All the psyllids
(overwintered adults) were collected in spring (March—
April) between 2002 and 2007, from a same site on different
P. spinosa. Genetic diversity within each locality was quantified
by the number of alleles per locus, and the observed and
expected heterozygosities (Ho, Hy). These statistics were
calculated using Genetix 4.05 (Belkhir et al. 1996-2004). For each locus and each locality, deviation from Hardy—
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested by first using
the ‘exact HW test’, and then using the score (or U) test
for testing alternative hypothesis ‘heterozygote deficiency’

with GenePop 4.0 (Rousset 2007). The same software was
also used to test for genetic linkage disequilibrium. All nine microsatellites showed high to very high poly-
morphism (Table 1) with 8-37 different alleles per locus. Ho, averaged across the five localities, varied from 0.222 for
the least variable locus to 0.764 for the most variable, all
values being slightly to very strongly lower than the Hy
levels. In the five localities (Table 2), allele numbers ranged
from four to 21 (for the least variable locality, COU) and
from three to 24 (for the most variable locality, MON), with
averages in the range of 10.8 and 13.6. Averaged Ho and Hy
ranged from 0.39 to 0.55, and from 0.68 to 0.81, respectively,
with all Ho values lower than the H, levels. Exact tests
performed within each locality showed significant deviation
from HWE, and more particularly a heterozygote deficiency,
for almost all loci (Table 2). Micro-Checker (Van Oosterhout
et al. 2004) detected no evidence for scoring error due to
stuttering or short allele dominance, but ‘true’ null alleles
were detected (P < 0.05) in all localities for almost all
loci, with the estimates of null alleles frequency ranging
between 0.05 and 0.40. Only females have been genotyped
in this study, and thus, a particular mode of reproduction
like arrhenotokous parthenogenesis cannot explain the
excess of homozygotes. We cannot entirely dismiss the

possibilities that the deviations from HWE could be caused
by inbreeding, assortative mating or Wahlund effect, but
our sampling regime, the mobility of the adults (psyllids
were caught after a long-distance migration from conifers),
and the ability of females to mate repeatedly would make this
unlikely. For most pairs of loci (31 out of 36), no significant
linkage disequilibrium was found after applying sequential
Bonferroni corrections for multiple tests. The nine polymorphic microsatellite markers described
in this study represent a useful and sensitive tool to investigate
population structure of C. pruniata large scale. Understanding
the factors influencing the genetic diversity of this psyllid
would provide key information about the scale of its move-
ments (and therefore of phytoplasma spread). It could also
help in determining whether Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum vectoring is influenced by underlying genetic
differences among €. pruni populations. Acknowledgements
