Abstract

A survey was conducted in 2005 and 2006 in order to determine the presence and importance of Cacopsylla pruni populations in four
different fruit tree producing areas of Spain affected by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ and the relation with the incidence of
the disease. The largest populations of C. pruni were found in Extremadura and the smallest in Aragén and Valencia. The mean
percentage of individuals of C. pruni carriers of ESFY (European stone fruit yellows) phytoplasma was around 10% in Extre-
madura, 15% in the plot of LLobregat (Catalufia) and 7% in the plot of Miravet (Catalufia). Key words: ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’, ESFY, incidence, vectors, Cacopsylla pruni. Introduction

‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ (former: European
stone fruit yellows phytoplasma, ESFY) belongs to the
apple proliferation group (AP) (Seemiiller e al., 1998)
or 16Sr X-B subgroup. The disease caused by this phy-
toplasma, previously known as apricot chlorotic leaf roll
is widespread in Europe and has been known for many
years. The first description was published in Italy by
Goidanich (1933). In Spain, the stone fruit disorders
have been reported mainly in plums and apricots in
Catalufia (Sala, 1935) and in Valencia (Sanchez Capu-
chino and Forner, 1973; Llacer et al., 1986). In plum
trees the symptoms are early blooms and shoots in
January and February, responsible for a lack of fructifi-
cation and substantial loss of production. In peach the
symptoms are early fructification and premature blush-
ing as well as irregularly distributed chlorosis in the tree
during autumn. Although various species of cicadellids have been de-
scribed as potential vectors of the disease the only spe-
cies identified as a vector of this phytoplasma is the
psyllid Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli). The identity of the
vector of the ESFY phytoplasma was unknown until
1998 when Carraro and his collaborators demonstrated
the transmission of ESFY through C. pruni to Japanese
plum in Italy. This species has as primary host exclu-
sively wild and cultivated Prunus species. It has one

plants, coniferous plants and other forest species. At the
beginning of spring adults lay their eggs in cultivated or
wild Prunus. A survey was conducted in order to determine the
presence and importance of the C. pruni population in
four different fruit tree producing areas of Spain where
the disease is widespread and the relation with the inci-
dence of the disease studied. Materials and methods

A survey was conducted in 2005 and 2006 in plots of
plum, peach, apricot, nectarine and cherry trees in four
different areas of Spain: Aragon, Cataluiia, Extremadura
and Valencia. Insects were captured in the ESFY-infected plots on
sticky yellow traps of 20 x 20 cm placed inside or
nearby the plots. Traps were placed 0.5 and 1 m above
the soil surface and were changed weekly between Feb-
ruary and July. The insects were classified and analyzed
by nested PCR using universal primers P1/P7 in the first
step and the f01/r01specific primers to AP group in the
second step (figure 1) (Ahrens and Seemiiller, 1992; Lo-
renz et al., 1995; Smart et al., 1996). Results and discussion

Important populations of C. pruni were found in the a-
rea of Extremadura in the Vegas Altas (Zurbaran and
Encomienda) plots and in plots of Llobregat (Barcelona)
in Catalufia (figure 2; table 1). The population of C.
pruni was lower in the area of Aragon and Valencia and
in one plot in Tarragona (Catalufia). In 2006 the number of C. pruni captured in Cataluiia
and Extremadura was slightly higher than in 2005. The
ESFY vector has not yet been identified in the fruit tree
area of Lerida where the incidence of the disease is low. Individuals of C. pruni were collected from March to
July. The population maximum was reached in May and
