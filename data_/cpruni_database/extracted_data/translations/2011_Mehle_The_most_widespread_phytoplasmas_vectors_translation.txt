Abstract

Phytoplasmas, as fastidious wall-less mollicutes, colonize phloem tissue of many plant species, including
grapevine and fruit trees. They are transmitted between plants by vegetative propagation and by sap-sucking
insect vectors, which enable spread of the diseases. In Slovenia in the period 2001-2010, 3,189 plant and
109 insect samples were collected in targeted surveys and analyzed for the presence of phytoplasmas by
molecular methods. Phytoplasmas were found in 1,708 plant samples; in 19 cases mixed phytoplasma
infection was also identified. The majority of the samples were collected within systematic surveys conducted
to determine the prevalence of phytoplasmas in Slovenia. ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’, associated with
apple proliferation (AP), ‘Ca. P. prunorum’, associated with European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) and ‘Ca
P. pyri’, associated with pear decline (PD), were detected in several fruit-growing areas of Slovenia. The most
widespread phytoplasma on grapevine in Slovenia was the stolbur phytoplasma, (‘bois noir’: BN). The same
phytoplasma was also identified in Convolvulus arvensis and Lycopersicon esculentum. Since 2005, the
‘flavescence dorée’ phytoplasma (FD), associated with serious disease of grapevine, has been reported in
Slovenian vineyards. The same phytoplasma was also detected in Clematis vitalba. During the surveys,

 

 

several known and putative vectors of phytoplasmas were identified in Slovenia

Introduction

Phytoplasmas are cell wall-less Gram-positive bacteria
of the class Mollicutes, and both their cell and genome
size are the smallest among bacteria. They are obligate
intracellular parasites, generally restricted to sieve
elements of the infected plants, and transmitted by
phloem-feeding  leafhoppers —_ (Cicadellidae),
planthoppers (Fulgoromorpha, Cixiidae), and psyllids
(Psyllidae) of the order Hemiptera. In addition, they
are also transmitted by the majority of the dodder
species, by micropropagation, grafting and cutting
techinques, and the possibility of phytoplasma
transmission by seed may not be excluded (Bertaccini,

2007; Calari et al., 2011). Determination of the
taxonomic status of phytoplasmas by the traditional
methods is not possible, however by molecular
methods phytoplasmas were demonstrated to represent
a clearly distinct monophyletic cluster within the class
Mollicutes. For classification of phytoplasmas the
‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ genus has been proposed
based on phylogeny produced on 16S ribosomal DNA. One sequence from each group of ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’
was selected as representative, with the reference strain
deposited in GenBank (IRPCM, 2004). Phytoplasmas
are associated with more than a thousand diseases of
wild and cultivated plants (Seemiller et al., 2002). An

The most widespread phytoplasma, vectors and measures for disease control in Slovenia

overview of phytoplasmas identified in fruit trees and
grapevines as well as some insect vectors in Slovenia
is provided in this paper. Phytoplasmas associated with important diseases
of grapevine and fruit trees

In Europe, fruit trees of the family Rosaceae are
seriously affected by phytoplasmas of the apple
proliferation group (AP, 16SrX group) (Lee et al., 1995). The AP group includes two phytoplasmas from the
lists of pests recommended for regulation (EPPO,
2010), ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri’,
as well as the widespread ‘Ca. P. prunorum’. These are
the agents associated with apple proliferation (AP),
pear decline (PD) and European stone fruit yellows
(ESFY), respectively (Seemuller and Schneider, 2004;
Marcone et al., 2010). Although ‘Ca. P. mali’ infection
prevails in the genus Malus, it has also been
occasionally identified in plants other than the typical
host, for example stone fruits and both European pear
(Pyrus communis) and Asian pear (Pyrus pyrifolia)
(Lee et al., 1995; Del Serrone et al., 1998; Seemuller
and Schneider, 2004). ‘Ca. P. pyri’ is associated with
the genus Pyrus (Seemiller and Schneider, 2004). ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ causes economically important disorders
in apricot (Prunus armeniaca), Japanese plum (Prunus
salicina) and peach (Prunus persica) (Carraro and
Osler, 2003). European plums (Prunus domestica) as
well as some other wild Prunus species (P. spinosa, P
cerasifera, P. insititia) are susceptible to the infection,
but generally do not show symptoms representing a
dangerous source of infection (Carraro and Osler,
2003; Carraro et al., 1998a, 2004). On the other hand,
Prunus avium has demonstrated a high level of
resistance to ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ (Jarausch et al., 1999). Phytoplasmas from the AP group have also been
detected in hazel (Corylus avellana), ash (Fraxinus
excelsior), dog rose (Rosa canina), hackberry (Celtis
australis), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), oak
(Quercus robur and Quercus rubra), hornbeam
(Carpinus betulus) and bindweed (Convolvulus
arvensis) (Seemuller and Schneider, 2004). Psyllids
seem to play a crucial role in the transmission of
phytoplasmas from the AP group (Tedeschi and Alma,
2004). ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ is transmitted to the host
plants of Prunus spp. by the vector Cacopsylla pruni
(Carraro et al., 1998b). Additionally, the leafhopper
Asymmetrasca decedens (synonym Empoasca decedens)
has been suggested as a potential vector of this
phytoplasma (Pastore et al., 2004). ’Ca. P. pyri’ is

transmitted to the host plants by Cacopsylla pyricola
(Davies et al., 1992), and Cacopsylla pyri (Carraro et
al., 1998c). Known psyllid vectors of ’Ca. P. mali’ are
Cacopsylla picta (synonym C. costalis) (Frisinghelli et
al., 2000; Jarausch et al., 2003) and C. melanoneura
(Tedeschi and Alma, 2004). Besides psyllids, some
other insects have been reported as vectors of ’Ca. P.
mali’, including the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius,
the leafhopper Artianus interstitialis (Hegab and El-
Zohairy, 1986) and Fieberiella florii (Krezal et al.,
1988; Tedeschi et al., 2004). On grapevine (Vitis vinifera) phytoplasmas are
associated with severe and worldwide present
symptomatology named grapevine yellows (GY). Although GYs are associated with different
phytoplasmas, infected plants show the same
symptoms of leaf rolling and curling, brittleness of
leaves along with yellowing or reddening, lack of cane
lignifications and desiccation of grape clusters. Leaf
necrosis and bark splitting may also develop (Lee et
al., 2000; Prince et al., 1993). The symptoms usually
appear in late spring or in the summer, and some
vines may die in the following years. In Europe the
most important GYs are ‘bois noir’ (BN) and
‘flavescence dorée’ (FD), which are indistinguishable
by symptoms. While the phytoplasma BN belonging
to stolbur or 16SrXII subgroup is widespread, that of
FD belonging to elm yellows subgroups 16StVC/D has
quarantine status in the European Union. It is also
recommended for regulation as a quarantine pest by
the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection
Organization (EPPO). The confirmed vector of BN is Hyalesthes obsoletus
Signoret (Maixner, 1994; Sforza et al., 1998). However,
it is supposed that this vector cannot efficiently
transmit BN from grapevine to grapevine and cannot
survive on the grapevine, which is a dead-end host for
BN phytoplasma. The natural reservoirs for this
phytoplasma are weeds, such as bindweed and nettle. Few other species have been identified as potential
vectors, including Pentastiridius beieri and Reptalus
quinquecostatus (Gatineau et al., 2001; Holzinger et
al., 2002; Trivellone et al., 2005). The main known
natural vector of FD is an ampelophagous leafhopper
Scaphoideus titanus Ball (Schvester et al., 1961, 1963). Dictyophara europea has recently been confirmed to
be able to transmit FD from clematis to grapevine
under greenhouse conditions (Filippin et al., 2009). Orientus ishidae has been shown to be infected with
different strains of FD (Mehle et al., 2010a). Other

phytoplasmas associated with GYs such as
phytoplasmas belonging to subgroups 16Srl-A, 16SrI-
B, 16SrIII-I, 16SrVII-A, 16SrX-B; and 16SrXII-B, were
sporadically reported in grapevine or are present in
particular geographical regions (Alma et al., 1996;
Davis et al., 1997, 1998; Angelini et al., 2007; Gajardo
et al., 2009). Methodological approaches for phytoplasma
detection and diagnosis

Reliable detection of phytoplasmas is notoriously
difficult and relies mainly on molecular techniques. The reasons are various and include their inability to
grow in vitro, besides the low annually and seasonally
fluctuating titres of the pathogens and their uneven
distribution in infected plants. The detection
techniques include conventional PCR, usually followed
by RFLP for specific determination of phytoplasma
16S rRNA group or species (Deng and Hiruki, 1991;
Lorenz et al., 1995, Schneider et al., 1995; Daire et a
1997; Angelini et al., 2001; Clair et al., 2003; Filippin
et al., 2009). In addition, several protocols based on
real-time PCR have been proposed recently for the
universal or group-specific determination of
phytoplasmas in either single or multiplex assays
(Baric and Dalla Via, 2004; Bianco et al., 2004;
Christensen et al., 2004; Jarausch et al., 2004; Galetto

al., 2009; Margaria et al., 2009; Pelletier et al., 2009;
Yvon et al., 2009). The advantages of the real-time
PCR assays lie in their higher sensitivity combined
with three-fold shorter processing time in comparison
with conventional PCR (Fig. 1). A real-time PCR assay using TaqMan minor groove
binder probes was recently designed for the general
presence of phytoplasmas as well as for the species or
group-specific detection of FD and BN (Hren et al.,
2007), aster yellows group (Nikoli¢ et al., 2009) and
AP group (Nikolié et al., 2010). Both the conventional PCR and the real-time PCR
approach have been applied for reliable determination
of phytoplasmas in Slovenian plants and their insect
vectors. In Slovenia, 3,298 samples were analyzed for the
presence of phytoplasmas between 2001 and 2010
(Table 2, 3). These were collected within systematic
surveys of the Phytosanitary Administration of the
Republic of Slovenia, carried out to determine the
presence of phytoplasma diseases in Slovenia. The
majority of samples derived from fruit trees of the
Rosaceae family and grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). Other
samples were either from other plant species or from
insect vectors. For the analysis, DNA was extracted

from insects, roots in the case of asymptomatic
samples, or shoots of symptomatic samples using a
CTAB extraction procedure, modified from a protocol
by Ahrens and Seemtller (1992). Since 2009, a new,
faster DNA extraction procedure based upon the
binding of DNA to magnetic beads (Pire et al., 2009:
Boben et al., 2007) has been implemented in the
detection procedure. In 2010, the time required for
detection was additionally reduced by implementation
of an automated simple homogenization step instead
of manual homogenization (Fig. 1). Phytoplasmas of the AP group associated with
diseases of fruit trees in Slovenia

In the period 2001-2010, 1,405 samples from fruit
trees in production and mother plant orchards from
different regions of Slovenia were tested for the
presence of ‘Ca. P mali’, ‘Ca. P. pyri’ and ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’. All three phytoplasmas were detected in
several areas in Slovenia where fruit trees are
cultivated (Table 1, 2). Specifically, ‘Ca. P mali’ is
present at low prevalence, and ‘Ca. P. pyri’ is found
only in some areas where pear is grown (Primorska,
Savinjska valley, Posavje, Stajerska). Similarly, ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ is present in the Primorska and Notranjska
regions where host crops are grown, but may be also
found at low prevalence in the Savinjska, Stajerska
and Prekmurje regions. All three ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’
species are under official control. Testing for ‘Ca. P.
mali’ in mother plants every six years is obligatory in
certified and standard material (Regulation, 2006),
and for ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ national control measures
against phytoplasma and its vector Cacopsylla pruni
are prescribed (Regulation, 2004). Disease symptom expression is highly variable, and
sometimes symptoms become visible only as a result
of special weather conditions or of significant changes
in cultivation practices. It is noteworthy that many
cultivars especially in the first years of tree
development do not show typical symptoms. Moreover,
several symptomless trees were proven to be latently
infected (Lesnik et al., 2007; Ambrozié Turk et al.,
2008). Such trees may be a hidden source of infection,
and its early detection and consequent tree removal
is as important as intensive vector control (Ambrozié
Turk et al., 2008; Mehle et al., 2010b). ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’

Infection of apple trees (Malus domestica) with ‘Ca. P.

mali’ was found in 76 samples (Table 2). In general,
infected symptomatic plants have altered size of leaf
stipules and witches’ broom formations. Nevertheless,
some of the infected apple trees did not show typical
symptoms, and some were even symptomless. Positive
results were obtained for 39% of symptomatic and 3%
of symptomless trees. The main transmission path of ‘Ca. P. mali’ is by
sap-sucking insect vectors, but transmission may also
occur through grafting of infected propagation
material (Kartte and Seemiuller, 1988). Although there
are little firm data available about the transmission
of ‘Ca. P. mali’ via natural root grafts (Baric et al.,
2008), such transmission has been confirmed in
Slovenia M9 apple rootstock (Lesnik et al., 2008). Besides being present in its natural host apple trees,
‘Ca. P. mali’ was also detected in four cherry (Prunus
avium), two apricot (P. armeniaca) and one plum (P.
domestica) sample (Table 1) (Mehle et al., 2007). ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’

‘Ca. P. pyri’ was identified in 81 samples of pear tree
(Pyrus communis) (Table 2). Seventy-five positive
samples derived from symptomatic trees and 6 samples
from trees without any symptoms. Thirty-eight per
cent of symptomatic trees were positive, while 26% of
symptomless trees tested positive. The typical
symptoms were reddening and curling of leaves, and
sometimes lines of necrotic tissue in the bark. ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’

Two hundred four samples of stone fruit trees (Prunus
sp.) were infected with ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ (Table 1). Forty-seven percent of symptomatic trees were
positive, and 27% of symptomless trees. Typical
symptoms were reddening and curling of leaves, and
sometimes lines of necrotic tissue in the bark. Among
53 apricot (Prunus armeniaca) trees, phytoplasma was
detected in 53% of the samples (64% of 36
symptomatic and 29% of 17 asymptomatic trees). In
the case of peach (Prunus persica) and nectarine trees
Ca. P. prunorum’ was detected in 41% of 314 sampled
trees. Among 59 symptomless samples of peaches, 3%
were positive. On the other hand, symptoms correlated
well with the infection; thus ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ was
confirmed in 50% of samples from symptomatic peach
plants. Although the total number of tested samples
from Japanese plum trees (Prunus salicina) was low,
all tested samples were proven to contain ‘Ca. P.

prunorum’. The very high infection rate of this plant
species is in accordance with the situation in Japanese
plum orchards elsewhere (Marcone et al., 2010). In
European plum tree (Prunus domestica) samples the
incidence of phytoplasma was 37%. It is worth noting
that in most infected plants the disease symptoms
were not expressed, which is in accordance with the
reports in the literature (Carraro et al., 1998a). Sweet
cherry trees (Prunus avium) and sour cherry trees
(Prunus cerasus) were also checked for the presence
of ’Ca. P. prunorum’ (Table 1). Although natural
infections with this phytoplasma have been observed
in this species (Marcone et al., 2010), the presence of
Ca. P. prunorum’ in cherry has not been confirmed in
Slovenia. Insect vectors of phytoplasmas from the AP group
in Slovenia

The known and putative insect vectors of
phytoplasmas from the AP group have not been
systemically sampled and analyzed in Slovenia. However, considering that some insect species that
are known or putative vectors of these phytoplasmas
are widespread in Slovenia (Seljak, 2006), their
possible involvement in phytoplasma transmission
should not be neglected (Table 3). The number of phytoplasma-infected insect
samples was loosely correlated with the number of
plant samples confirmed to be infected with specific
phytoplasmas. For instance, six out of eight tested
specimens of Cacopsylla pruni, vector of ‘Ca. P.
Prunorum’ (Carraro et al., 1998b), were infected with
this phytoplasma (Table 3). Testing of two samples of
a putative vector of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’, Asymmetrasca
decedens (Pastore et al., 2004), did not yield positive
result (Table 2). Both vectors of ‘Ca. P. pyri’, Cacopsylla pyricola
(Davies et al., 1992) and Cacopsylla pyri (Carraro et
al., 1998c), are widespread in Slovenia (Seljak, 2006). Only one sample of C. pyri was examined and the
presence of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in that sample was confirmed
(Table 2). There are several reported vectors that transmit
‘Ca. P. mali’. Among them are species that are
widespread in Slovenia (Seljak, 2006, Holzinger and
Seljak, 2001, Seljak, 2004), for example Cacopsylla
picta (Frisinghelli et al., 2000; Jarausch et al., 2003),
C. melanoneura (Tedeschi and Alma, 2004), Philaenus
spumarius (Hegab and El-Zohairy, 1986), Artianus
interstitialis (Hegab and El-Zohairy, 1986) and possibly

Fieberiella florii (Krezal et al., 1988; Tedeschi and
Alma, 2004). However these insects were not yet
included in the Slovenian surveys. In areas with high
infection pressure due to common occurrence of host
plants and phytoplasma insect vectors, the
maintenance of healthy mother plants in the open
field is quite difficult, so the use of insect-proof net-
houses was suggested and confirmed to be appropriate
for stone fruit mother plant cultivation (Ambrozié
Turk et al., 2010). Phytoplasmas associated with grapevine yellows
diseases in Slovenia

In 1,679 tested symptomatic grapevine (Vitis vinifera)
samples 7% percent of samples were infected with FD
and 70 % with BN (Table 2). Bois Noir

At the beginning of the survey in 2001, all
symptomatic grapevine plants tested were positive for
BN phytoplasma that is widespread in all winegrowing
regions of Slovenia (Table 1). During the surveys BN
was also detected in 13 out of 30 samples of bindweed
(Convolvulus arvensis) tested (Table 2). Phytoplasma
closely related to BN and belonging to the stolbur
group were found in one out of six tested tomato
plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) expressing stunting
and dying symptomatology (Table 1, 2). The main vectors of BN occur in Slovenia (Table
3). A test for BN presence in Hyalesthes obsoletus
(Maixner et al., 1995) revealed 18 positive samples
out of 23. BN was also found in other insects, including
Euscelis incisus, Reptalus panzeri, Reptalus cuspidatus
and Scaphoideus titanus. Among these, only R. panzeri
has been confirmed as a vector of stolbur
phytoplasmas in corn (Jovié et al., 2007). Flavescence dorée

The first finding of FD was in the coastal area in the
south-western part of Slovenia in 2005, in the
following years FD was also detected in other
winegrowing regions. It was usually found in
individual plants in vineyards. However, in 2010 an
epidemic spread was observed in the south-eastern
and south-western areas of Slovenia, where a heavy
infection rate of symptomatic grapevine plants was
observed. Since the disease is under official control
in Slovenia all FD infected plants and plants showing
symptoms must be removed from vineyards. Phytopathogenic Mollicutes, Vol. 1(2), December 2011

the first finding was in 2005; 619 samples were infected with both BN and FD; ‘samples were also tested for FD; Salmost symptomless;
*several symptomless apple trees were tested because testing of mother plants for ‘Ca, P. mali’ is obligatory every six years in Slovenia;

‘Mehle et al., 2007; 9samples were also tested for ‘Ca. P. prunorum’

Obligatory vector treatment and a ban on use of
material for propagation are imposed (Regulation,
2009). Once FD is confirmed, further removal of all
symptomatic plants from infected vineyards can be
done without sampling/testing. If more than 20 % of
plants show symptoms, the entire vineyard is uprooted. Molecular characterization of FD genetic clusters
in grapevines by RFLP and sequencing showed that in
Slovenia about two thirds of tested infected grapevines
harboured the FD2 strain (Mehle et al., 2011), which
correlates well with data from France and Italy (Arnaud

et al., 2007; Filippin et al., 2009). However, about one
third of isolates from grapevine belonged to the genetic
cluster FD3 (Mehle et al., 2011). In Slovenia no
grapevine infected with FD1 was detected (Mehle et
al., 2011). FDp was also detected in 49 out of 69 samples of
Clematis vitalba (Table 1, 2), including in areas away
from vineyards and areas where FD has not been found
in grapevine. The infected clematis plants either

from clematis plants belonged to the FD3 genetic
cluster (Mehle et al., 2011) in accordance with reports
of other FD infected clematis plants (Angelini et al.,
2004; Filippin et al., 2009). Insect vectors of FD

It is interesting that until 2010 the presence of FD
was confirmed only in 1 out of 57 tested samples of
S. titanus, the main natural vector of FD (Table 3). S.
titanus has been identified in western Slovenia since
1983 and in eastern Slovenia only since 2003. Considering that it is already widespread it is very
likely that this low rate of detected infections is due
to low levels of FD in vineyards. In 2009, adults of
another leafhopper, Orientus ishidae, were captured
on bushy vegetation in areas distant from vineyards. They were confirmed to be infected with phytoplasmas
similar to FD from grapevine (Mehle et al., 2010a). In
O. ishidae FD1, FD2 and FD3 were detected (Mehle et
al., 2010a; 2011). Further research is needed to shed
light on the role of O. ishidae in the possible
transmission of FD. Additionally, alder (Alnus glutinosa and A. incana)
may harbour phytoplasma isolates that are very similar
to FD1, FD2 and FD3 strains and are transmitted by
Oncopsis alni (Filippin et al., 2009; Arnaud et al.,
2007; Mehle et al., 2011). Other phytoplasmas associated with grapevine
yellows diseases

GY diseases is are associated with a wide variety of
phytoplasmas. For instance in the Republic of South
Africa, Italy, Tunisia, Israel, North America and Chile
it is associated in some cases also with aster yellows
phytoplasmas from the 16SrI group (Prince et al., 1993;
Alma et al., 1996; Carstens, 2008: Gajardo et al., 2009). In the Slovenian survey of phytoplasmas an isolate
from this group was detected in purple coneflower
(Echinacea purpurea) (Radisek et al., 2009). Conclusion

Presence of ‘Ca. P. mali’, ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ and ‘Ca. P.
pyri’ were confirmed in several fruit-growing areas of
Slovenia. The most widespread phytoplasma on
grapevine in Slovenia is BN phytoplasma, stolbur
phytoplasma was also identified in bindweeds and
tomato plants. Since 2005, the phytoplasma FD that
causes the most serious disease of viticulture,
‘flavescence dorée’, has been identfied in Slovenian

Natasa Mehle et al

vineyards. FDp was also confirmed in Clematis plants
and Aster yellows phytoplasma was detected in purple
coneflower. Several known and putative vectors of
these phytoplasmas were identified in Slovenia and in
some of them particular phytoplasmas were also
detected. For quarantine phytoplasma diseases, several
measures are prescribed by national regulation. Acknowledgements
