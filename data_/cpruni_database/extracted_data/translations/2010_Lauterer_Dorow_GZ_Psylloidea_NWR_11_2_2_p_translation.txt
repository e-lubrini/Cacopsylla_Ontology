1 Introduction

The superfamily of leaf flakes (Psylloidea) includes, along with aphids (Aphidoidea), scale insects
(Coccoidea) and whitefly (Aleyrodidae) to the order of plant lice (Sternorrhyncha). Sometimes the latter are only considered as a suborder and together with bugs (Heteroptera),
Cicadas (Auchenorrhyncha) and Sheathbills (Coleorrhyncha) in the order of the Beak Kerfe
(Hemiptera) combined. In the past, cicadas and plant lice were combined into the Homoptera,
it turned out, however, that there is no closest relationship between these two groups,
the Homoptera are not monophyletic. Around 3,500 leaf flea species have been described worldwide, 382 of which live in Europe (BurckHaRDT 2010)
and 189 in Central Europe (BuRckHarDT 2002). Since many species are still undescribed, is worldwide
with a twice as high number of species expected. So far 119 species are known from Germany and
from Hesse 47 (BurckHARDT & LautERER 2003). In general, the leaf flea fauna of Germany is still
insufficiently studied, so that other species and larger areas of distribution are to be expected. A comprehensive treatment of the native fauna is in preparation (BURCKHARDT & LAUTERER). All psyllids have an exclusively phytosug diet, most species are mono- or oligophagous
to individual or closely related nutrient plant species (mainly Dicotyledonae, more rarely
Monocotyledonae) restricted. In Germany only Bactericera nigricornis polyphagous lives from representatives
different plant orders. Depending on the species, the females lay their eggs on leaves, buds,
Blossoms, flower stalks, stalks or on the bark of young twigs and fix them with a pedicelus
in plant tissue. The egg is separated from living plant tissue with water via a hydropyle
provided. The larvae have a characteristic oval shape that is flattened dorsoventrally. The slip-
larvae suck on plants and, depending on the species, either live freely on these plants or
sessile in grib galls or in closed galls. Also those sucking freely on the plant
Species are hardly mobile. They produce large amounts of honeydew and wax gland secretions. Also
the adults produce honeydew, but in smaller quantities. The highly sugary honeydew
Glues together plant stigmata and serves as a growth substrate for the black mycelia of the call dew fungi
(Capnodiaceae) on leaves and fruit. Also sucking assimilates, the formation of galls
or leaf deformation and the transmission of phytoplasma bacterial infections leads to
damage to plants. However, some species are also used in biological pest control
against neophytes such as B. the Japanese herb gardener (Fallopia japonica) used. The imagines have good jumping ability and are excellent long-distance flyers;
Species that overwinter on conifers as imago often fly tens of kilometers (CerMAk & LAUTERER
2008). Most native species overwinters as an imago, particularly on conifers, another
considerable portion in egg stage and few as larvae on roots of herbs or basal on
leaf sheaths. The migration phase begins in most species 7-10 days after moulting
Imago, often still as weakly sclerotized individuals (especially on Salix species, LautERER
personal obs.). Return migration to host plants begins early in the year, particularly at
Cacopsylla species. So far, the psyllid fauna of the Buchenwalder has not been extensively studied, since the
Beech in Europe does not feed on leaf flies and only a few species overwinter on it (Lauterer
in preparation). The psyllid fauna of the Central European beech forest is thus made up of leaf fleas
of the secondary tree species and the shrub and herbaceous layer plants and is
Wintering guests from surrounding biotopes added. 2 Materials and Method

The flea fauna of Germany was analyzed by BurckHARDT & LauTeRER (2003) based on published data
compiled separately by federal state. In general, however, it has not yet been adequately investigated,
which was preparatory work for a comprehensive presentation of the local fauna (BuRcKHARDT & LAUTERER
in preparation) with numerous as yet unpublished collections. Therefore, with re-evidence
to be expected for many federal states. For this reason, detailed information is not given below
Present information on distribution in Germany. 3.1. Types of Goldbachs and Ziebachstricks

Aphalara exilis (Weser & Mour, 1804)

[Found GF: 1, TR: 1, VF: 0]

Distribution: This species has only recently been scientifically described in detail (OssiANNILSSON
1992, BurckHARDT & LautERER 1997), since several species are among the earlier reports
hid. For this reason, older find data cannot be used without viewing the material for
Distribution information can be used, but the species is certainly over the whole of Europe and the northern ones
widespread in the Caucasus. In contrast, earlier reports from Asia and North America are different
assign species. The species is widespread in Germany. Ecology: Aphalara exilis is meso- to hygrophilic, relatively nitrophilic and psychrophilic (cold-loving) and
inhabits grassland in particular. The species is rarely found with many individuals, the most common
in montane and alpine habitats. Aphalara exilis lives on the lesser sorrel (Rumex acetosa),
Blunt dock (Rumex obtusifolius) and other closely related species. In the event of a heavy infestation
with larvae the leaves may turn purple. Aphalara exilis is monovoltine and overwinters as
Imago on conifers or in the litter layer of forests and meadows. The wintered animals are alive
until July, the new generation hatches in August. The oviposition takes place from May to early June near the
nerves of older leaves. The larvae stop in particular, protected by fluffy waxy secretions
the bases of shoots and petioles. Occurrence in the area: Only one male was caught between November 30th, 1994 and April 27th, 1995 in
caught in the white shell of the Total Reserve. Cacopsylla brunneipennis (Epwarps, 1896)
[Found GF: 2, TR: 1, VF: 1]

Distribution: The species is known from Europe, Kazakhstan and Transcaucasia. In
It is rare in southern Europe and only occurs in the mountains. The species is relatively widespread in Germany
and often. 102

LaurereR, P. & Dorow, W. H. O Blattfiéhe (Psylloidea)

 

Ecology: Cacopsylla brunneipennis lives on willow species (Salix spp. ), especially on Salix caprea. The species is monovoltine and overwinters as an imago. She sets off on the mild February days
Search for their host plants, where oviposition begins in March and reaches its maximum in April. The larvae first stay in the female catkins and on the young leaves. the 5th The larval stage lasts until May, and the first imagines appear from the beginning of May. After a suction phase
from a little over a week, the animals look for conifers as protective plants. Occurrence in the area: One female was caught between 26.10. until 6.12.1995 in
Stammeklektor GZ 31 of the total reserve or GZ 33 of the comparison area caught. Cacopsylla crataegi (CUPBOARD, 1801)
[Found GF: 1, TR: -, VF: 1]

Distribution: Cacopsyllacrataegi is a holopalaarctic species with a wide distribution (according to
of their food plant genus from Great Britain to the Far East and India). She is in Germany
widespread but not common. Ecology: Cacopsylla crataegi prefers warm toned habitats. The species lives on oligophagous
Hawthorn (Crataegus spp. ), is univoltine and overwinters as an imago mainly on conifers, more rarely
on deciduous trees (hawthorn [Crataegus spp. ], oaks [Quercus spp.] Etc.). After hibernation
the animals first fly to various shrubs and trees (Prunus, Salix, Quercus, etc. ), concentrated
but then in April they feed on the actual host plants. Older host information from Georgia,
according to which the species is also found on apple (Malus domestica), Greek whitebeam (Sorbus graeca) and
Service tree (Sorbus domestica) lives (GEGECHKOR!I & Locinova 1990), could not in other regions
beeing confirmed. Egg-laying takes place in the first decade of May, the first imagines of the new ones
Generation appear at the end of May and especially in June. After spending several days on the
Nutrient plants they look for protective plants during the parapause and then for their overwintering habitats. Occurrence in the area: A female was killed between 26.10. to 6.121995 in
Stammeklektor GZ 33 caught in the comparison area. Cacopsylla melanoneura (Foerster, 1848)
[Founds GF: 8, TR: 1, VF: 7]

Distribution: Cacopsylla melanoneura is a holopalaarctic species with a wide distribution of
Great Britain to the Far East and Japan. In Germany it goes with Cacopsylla mali and
Trioza urticae among the most common psyllid species. Ecology: The species lives on hawthorn (Crataegus spp. ), but was also found on apple (Malus spp. ), Pear
(Pyrus spp.) and medlar (Mespilus spp.) in Georgia, Hungary, Crimea, Czech Republic, Germany
and more recently in north-west Italy, where they are an important vector for
Photoplasma diseases in apple trees. In field experiments it could be shown that
that not all apple and pear varieties are vacuumed. The species is already leaving its winter quarters
in February/March and can then first be found on a wide variety of bushes and trees, concentrated
but concentrates almost exclusively on Crataegus in March/April. Larvae appear from early May to
At the end of July, the first adults of the new generation shortly before the end of May. After about a week
migration takes place on the nutritive plant - mostly passively by wind drift - over dozens of
kilometers to the overwintering plants. Very few individuals remain in the lowlands
master migration to conifers at altitudes over 400 m up to alpine forests (Cermak & Lauterer 2008). According to the findings in the Hohestein natural forest reserve (LauterRER & Dorow 2007), there are also dead ones
branches on the ground as thick as an arm are used for wintering. Occurrence in the area: Five males and three females were exclusively found in the winter
Fishing periods (March 25th - April 25th, 1994, November 30th, 1994 - April 27th, 1995, December 7th, 1995 - May 3rd, 1996) with log collectors
living beeches and dirrstanders, one animal also with the GZ 121 air extractor. 103

Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoul, 1763)

[Found GF: 2, TR: 1, VF: 1]

Distribution: Cacopsylla pruni is a Euro-Siberian and Central Asian species found everywhere in
Germany and is most common in the southern parts of the country. Ecology: The monovoltine species is oligophagous on cherries, plums, sloes and apricots (Prunus
spp.) and possibly some closely related species. It is considered a dangerous carrier of
Stone fruit yellowing disease caused by phytoplasma (see e.g. B. Ackermann et al. 2006). In Central Europe, however, the species lives mainly on sloe (Prunus spinosa). cacopsyllapruni
Winters as an imago almost exclusively on conifers, very rarely on shrubs. The host plants will
from the first decade of April, but primarily populated in the second. You live until the second
decade of June. Egg-laying takes place from the end of April. Like the other representatives of the subgenus
Thamnopsylla they suck after the imaginal moult only for a short time (one to at most two weeks)
on the nutritive plants and then switch to their overwintering plants. Occurrence in the area: A female was killed between 25.3. to April 25, 1994 in the blue one
Color shell of the total reserve caught, another one between 11/30/1994 and 4/27/1995 in
Air collector of the reference area. Trioza remota Foerster, 1848
(Founds GF: 7, TR: 5, VF: 2]

Distribution: The total distribution of this species is not exactly known, since it was only recently
it was discovered that, at least in the Mediterranean area, there were not one but three very similar ones
types. The species is widespread and common throughout Central Europe - as well as in Germany. Ecology: The monovoltine species lives monophagously on oak trees (Quercus spp. ), especially on English oak
(Quercus robur) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea). The imagines are probably overwintering
high on deciduous trees but also on conifers. They migrate back at the end of April/beginning of May
their host plants when they are not yet leafy. You then focus on particular
forest edges. In May, the females lay 1-2 eggs on the underside of many ca. 5 cm long
peel off. The eggs and larvae of the 1. Stages cause small flat pitted galls that
are concave on the underside. Usually there are only a few galls on a leaf. But you are
regularly distributed over large forest areas. in the 2nd Larval stage will be parapaused by the end of August
inserted, after which the larval development is continued for a short time. In September and October
then the imagines of the new generation hatch, which gradually move into the wintering habitats
wander off Occurrence in the area: There were three males and four females with an elecector
caught on a live beech trunk and yellow colored shells only in the cold season
(25.4.-26.5.1994, 30.11.1994-27.4.1995, 6.12.1995-3.5.1996). It should be with them to animals at the
migration towards or away from winter quarters. Trioza urticae (Linnaeus, 1758)
[Founds GF: 21, TR: 5, VF: 16]

Distribution: The species has a holopalaarctic distribution, but is absent in Japan and the Canary Islands,
but penetrates to India. It is common throughout the range. Ecology: Trioza urticae lives monophagously on stinging nettles (Urtica spp. ), in Central Europe on Urtica
dioica and Urtica urens. The species prefers shady habitats in forests where migratory individuals
can also be found on the lower branches of bushes and trees. Trioza urticae is polyvoltine (the
number of possible generations is unknown) and shows no dormancy, only cold inhibition. Adults are found all year round, larvae from June to November. In case of mass infestation
Deformations can occur, particularly at the tips of young nutritive plants: twisting
and dwarfing of the stem, curling and wrinkling of the leaves. Hibernation takes place in
imaginal stage mainly in the herbaceous layer of damp forest habitats rich in stinging nettles,
less often on conifers. The species does not undertake long migrations to the wintering grounds. 104

Laurerer, P. & Dorow, W. H. O Blattfdhe (Psylloidea)

 

Occurrence in the area: The species was identified in the area with eclects on standing living and
dead trunks and blue and yellow colored shells. Most catches come in the cold
Season from November to April, only the catches with the yellow colored shells arrive in July
1994 and 1995. These are probably animals that live between feeding and wintering habitats
migrated. 3.2. Other species from other Hessian natural forest reserves

Ecology: two generations a year; Nutrient plants: greater and lesser burnet (Sanguisorba
officinalis, Sanguisorba minor); both threatened by premature mowing (in June-July and in September),
which often occurs before the molting of Bactericera modesta to the imago; Imaginal overwintering on conifers

Trioza abdominalis Fvor, 1861
Distribution: Europe without the southern European peninsulas; not common in Germany

Ecology: Nutrient plant: Meadow yarrow (Achillea millefolium) in the submontane and montane
range, in the lowlands only in the boreal zone; one generation a year; Imagines hibernate on
conifers

Trioza anthrisci BurcKHarDT, 1986

Distribution: Europe without the southern European peninsulas; in Germany in the submontane and
montane area common locally

Ecology: in damp locations (streams and springs, etc. ); Nutrient plants: Meadow chervil
(Anthriscus sylvestris), meadow hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium) and some related Apiaceae. Imagines wintering on conifers; one generation a year

Trioza flavipennis Foerster, 1848

Distribution: Europe without the southern European peninsulas; often in Germany

Ecology: Often in hilly to montane areas, mainly in streams, along forest paths and
forest edges, mostly absent in the lowlands; Nutrient plant: ground elder (Aegopodium podagraria);

bulging on the upper side of the leaf is induced by oviposition; Imagines hibernate on
conifers; one generation a year

Trioza foersteri Meyer major, 1871

Distribution: common in Anatolia and southern Europe, northern distribution limit runs through
Germany, Czech Republic and Poland; strong annual fluctuations in abundance in Central Europe
significant increase in populations after several warm years

Ecology: Nutrient plant: wall lettuce (Mycelis muralis), especially in forests of the colline zone;
induction of pitted galls on the leaves; Imagines wintering on conifers; a generation in
Year

Trioza rhamni (CUPBOARD, 1801)

Distribution: Europe and Caucasus excluding the southern European peninsulas; in Germany far
common and frequent

Ecology: Nutrient plant: Purging buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica); inducing zealous
pit galls on underside of leaf; in Central Europe two generations a year, in Scandinavia only
one; Imagines hibernate on conifers, but presumably also in the litter

Trioza rotundata Fior, 1861

Distribution: Europe without the southernmost parts, Caucasus and Transcaucasia; in Germany
widespread and locally common

Ecology: Nutrient plants: bitter bittercress (Cardamine amara) and other representatives of
genus and watercress (Nasturtium officinale); in streams and springs as well as swamps
the colline to montane level; Imagines wintering on conifers; one generation a year

4 Discussion

In the Goldbachs-/Ziebachsrück, seven species with a total of 45 individuals caught in the traps
detected, including 22 males and 20 females. This makes 5.9% of Germans
and 14.9% of the Hessian species. The finds, separated by total reserve and comparison area,
are presented in the complete list of species at the end of this volume (Dorow & Buick 2010: Tab. 5). Many
Species have only been recorded with very few individuals, only for Cacopsylla melanoneura
and Trioza urticae indicates a more frequent occurrence in the comparison area. So far, in the four natural forest reserves that have been completely examined (FLECHTNER et al. 2000: 495-496,
Dorow et al. 2004: 336, LauTeRER & Dorow 2007: 95-101) 28 different types of psyllids detected
(Tab. 1). As with many other animal groups (Dorow & KopeLke 2007, Dorow et al. 2009), were
most species caught in the Niddahangen and in the Schénbuche. In the Niddahangen was
in particular the occurrence of other tree species such as maple, alder and ash responsible for this,
which were (largely) absent in the other areas. The numbers of individuals were also in these two

total reserve as well as in the comparison area were present, only the latter species was missing in the trap catches
of the total reserve at Hohestein. Five other species occurred in three areas, three in two areas and
eleven only in one area. Only Cacopsylla brunneipennis were more numerous (over 20 animals per species).

Hohestein, where twice as many species were caught in the comparison area. However, were
the additional species are only occupied by single individuals, so that the evidence of these presumably
species that are relatively few in individuals in the area in just one area can also be due to chance. The number of individuals, on the other hand, differed significantly between the total reserves and theirs

Species found only in other natural forest reserves colonize the tree layer (Acer,
Alnus, Fraxinus, Pyrus, Rhamnus, Salix) or the herb layer (Achillea, Aegopodium, Anthriscus,

were recorded and why in all natural forest reserves examined so far only one larva of a
Craspedolepta species could be detected with the traps. 109
