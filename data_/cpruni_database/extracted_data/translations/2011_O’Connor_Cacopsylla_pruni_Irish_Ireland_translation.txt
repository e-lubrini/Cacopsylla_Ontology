The Irish psyllid (Hemiptera) fauna is reviewed. A checklist is provided of the 50 known
species with new distributional data. Five of the species (Bactericera albiventris (Foerster,
1848); Cacopsylla (Hepatopsylla) hippophaes (Foerster, 1848); Neocraspedolepta subpunctata
(Foerster, 1848); Psyllopsis distinguenda Edwards, 1913 and Spanioneura fonscolombii
Foerster, 1848) are new to Ireland while another one (Cacopsylla (Thamnopsylla) alaterni
(Foerster, 1848)) requires confirmation. Psylla (Psylla) betulae (Linnaeus, 1758) is confirmed

as an Irish species. Key words: Psylloidea, Hemiptera, Ireland, jumping plant-lice, review, check list, new

records, distribution. Introduction

The suborder Sternorrhyncha of the Hemiptera contains four superfamilies viz. Aphidoidea,
Aleyrodoidea, Psylloidea and Coccoidea, characterized by the position of the rostrum, which
appears to arise from between the fore coxae. These superfamilies include many of the most
serious pests of agricultural and horticultural plants. All the pest species cause direct feeding
damage and some transmit plant diseases. The Psylloidea popularly known as psyllids or
jumping plant-lice, comprise a group of around 3000 species that may be mistaken for leaf-
hoppers belonging to the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. However the two-segmented tarsi, multi-
segmented antennae and simplified wing venation will easily distinguish psyllids from leaf-

hoppers (Martin and Webb, 1999). Reproduction is typically sexual although parthenogentic

reproduction has been recorded, or is suspected, for a small number of species (Hodkinson,
2009). Eggs are always laid, followed by five larval stages which are fully mobile. Some
species develop within bud, flower, leaf, stem or root galls while others develop under a
secreted protective cover called a lerp (Hodkinson, 2009). Foerster (1848) recorded 18 species new to Ireland based on specimens sent to him by A. H.
Haliday. Subsequent workers on the group are mentioned in the text. The present paper presents
data on 50 species. Five species (Bactericera albiventris (Foerster, 1848); Cacopsylla
(Hepatopsylla) hippophaes (Foerster, 1848); Neocraspedolepta subpunctata (Foerster, 1848);
Psyllopsis distinguenda Edwards, 1913 and Spanioneura fonscolombii Foerster, 1848) are new
to Ireland, while presence of another one (Cacopsylla (Thamnopsylla) alaterni (Foerster, 1848))
requires confirmation. Psylla (Psylla) betulae (Linnaeus, 1758) is confirmed as an Irish species. New distribution records are included for other species based on material collected by the senior
author and on his identification of unnamed or misnamed specimens in the National Museum of
Treland. The identification of other historic material in NMI was confirmed and where of note,
records are given. Eight species (16% of the Irish psyllid fauna) are non-native introductions
that have become naturalized. Specimens were determined using Hodkinson (2007), Hodkinson
and Hollis (1980, 1987), Hodkinson and White (1979), Martin and Malumphy (1995),
Ossianilsson (1992) and White and Hodkinson (1982). Many of the Irish species are illustrated
in an online identification guide to British bugs (http://www. britishbugs.org.uk/index.html) and
in a pictorial key to European Cacopsylla species associated with Rosaceae
(http://www.psyllidkey.eu/index.html). Where possible, the nomenclature of the plants follows
Stace (1995). The authorities are given for plant species not in Stace (op. cit.). The following abbreviations are used in the text: AHH — A. H. Haliday; AWS — A. W.
Stelfox; CIC — C. I. Carter; CM — Chris Malumphy; CR - Colm Ronayne; EFB - E. F. Bullock;
GHC — G. H. Carpenter; JNH — J. N. Halbert; JPOC — J. P. O’Connor; MAOC — M. A.
O’Connor; MPC - M.-P. Chauzat; NMI — National Museum of Ireland; WFJ — W. F. Johnson. Square brackets [] indicate that the collector’s identity has been recognised from the hand-

writing on the data labels. 22

found throughout Europe (Hodkinson and White, 1979). Cacopsylla (Thamnopsylla) alaterni (Foerster, 1848) Requires confirmation as an Irish
species

Cacopsylla alaterni was recorded as Psylla alaterni by Foerster (1848) based on two 33
sent by Haliday under the ms name alaterni. Walker (1852) also mentioned Haliday material. The host plant is Rhamnus alaternus popularly known as Mediterranean or Italian buckthorn. The species is known from the Balearic and Canary Islands, England, France and Italy including
Sardinia and Sicily (Hodkinson and White, 1979; Burckhardt, 2009). The host plant is a native of the Mediterranean region. Although it has been cultivated in
British gardens since 1629, there appears to be only one subsequent record of Cacopsylla
alaterni from it in the British Isles. It is known that Haliday spent most of the years 1841-1848
in Italy (Nash and O’Connor, 201 1). It is significant that he sent the specimens with a ms name. The material was probably collected in Italy and recognized there as a new species. Haliday
normally did not label his specimens with locality data and it is very likely that he included
Italian Cacopsylla alaterni with Irish psyllids collected in 1848. It has been assumed by later

workers that because they were sent from Ireland, they were actually Irish specimens. This

would explain the curious distribution. Cacopsylla alaterni requires confirmation therefore as
an Irish species. Cacopsylla (Thamnopsylla) crataegi (Schrank, 1801)
