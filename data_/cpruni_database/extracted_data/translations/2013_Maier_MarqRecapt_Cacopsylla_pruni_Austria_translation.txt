European stone fruit yellows

(ESFY) caused by

Abstract

During the last 15 years, European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) has become
a major concern in Austrian fruit production. Therefore, presence and
temporal dynamics of its vector Cacopsylla pruni were investigated using a
beating tray method and yellow sticky traps on Prunus armeniaca, Prunus
domestica, Prunus spinosa and P. cerasifera nigra. Infection rates of C. pruni
and Prunus spp. trees were assessed by direct, nested and real-time PCR. Movement of remigrants in a model apricot orchard was tracked by aid of
a mark, release and recapture study. Insects were marked by fluorescent
dyes. Movement of the marked insects and presence of naturally occur-
ring insects were monitored by yellow sticky traps. In 2011, remigration
of C. pruni to Prunus spp. started in calendar week 10 (8th of March) and
in 2012, in calendar week 12 (18th of March). Remigrants were observed
until calendar week 20 (middle of May), significant numbers of the
springtime generation adults were present until week 26 (end of June). The phytoplasma was ascertained in 0-11.5% of the remigrants and in
0-3.44% of the springtime generation insects. About 9.8-63.3% of the
apricot samples, 20-40% of the plum samples and single blackthorn sam-
ples were infected. The mark, release and recapture study proved a fast
and frequent tree-to-tree movement of remigrated C. pruni adults. Insects
easily covered distances from row to row or even farther (ca. 13 m) within
24 h after release and were present in a large part of the model orchard
after 8 days (up to 24 m from release point). apricots (Prunus armeniaca) and Japanese plums
(Prunus salicina). In apricots, the disease is character-
ized by small-sized, conically rolled, chlorotic leaves,

“Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ is widespread
throughout Europe except the North and most parts
of Great Britain. Outside Europe, it is known to be
present in large parts of Turkey (COST action FA 0807
2013). The phytoplasma primarily infects plants of the
genus Prunus, causing severe damage particularly in

premature fruit fall, small tasteless fruits, decreased
vitality of infected trees and eventually death of single
branches or entire trees (Morvan 1977; Marcone et al. 2010). Based on phylogenetic analyses of the 16 § rDNA,
‘Ca. P. prunorum’ is placed in the apple proliferation

(16SrX) cluster together with other important phy-
toplasma diseases of fruit trees such as apple prolifera-
tion and pear decline (Seemiiller and Schneider
2004). European stone fruit yellows is transmitted by the
plum psyllid Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli) (Carraro et al. 1998). Cacopsylla pruni is univoltine, strictly oligopha-
gous on Prunus, overwinters on conifers and remi-
grates to Prunus in early spring. On Prunus, the insects
lay eggs and develop through five larval stages into
adults which abandon their Prunus hosts in summer
(Ossiannilsson 1992; Thébaud et al. 2009). Studies
suggest that remigrated C. pruni returning to apricot
orchards in spring are the most efficient disease vec-
tors. Secondary spread within an orchard during a
vegetation period seems to be marginal (Carraro et al. 2004; Thébaud et al. 2009; Poggi Pollini et al. 2010). Wild Prunus species such as P. domestica and P. spinosa
are both frequently tolerant hosts of the phytoplasma
and suitable hosts for C. pruni. These species could
therefore play a significant role as sources of
infectious vectors (Carraro et al. 2002). Proposed
management approaches include the use of healthy
propagation material, the removal of rootstock
suckers, uprooting of infected trees and application of
insecticides against both remigrants and springtime
generation. Clearing strategies and __ insecticide
treatments have to be designed according to the regio-
nal situation. In areas where the disease is present
epidemically on wild Prunus, hosts uprooting of
infected trees and control of immature vectors in
orchards are likely to be insufficient or even ineffi-
cient (Thébaud et al. 2009). Insecticides against
C. pruni are not authorized in many countries, and
efficiency of insecticides both on the transmitting
insect and on disease spread has yet to be evaluated
(Marcone et al. 2010). During the last 15 years, the importance of ESFY in
Austria has significantly increased (Richter 1999; Lai-
mer Da Camara Machado et al. 2001; Riedle-Bauer
et al. 2012). Currently, severe disease outbreaks occur
in the Wachau, one of the most important apricot
growing areas of Austria, located on both sides of the
Danube river in Lower Austria. The deep and narrow
river valley is characterized by apricot orchards in the
plain near the river and forests consisting of decidu-
ous trees and conifers at higher altitude. The apricots
produced there are designed as ‘Wachauer Qua-
litatsmarille’, a product with protected designation of
origin (PDO, Commission of the European Commu-
nity Regulation EC 1107/96). Fruits are produced
mainly of the local cultivar ‘Klosterneuburger Marille’
(a clone of ‘Hungarian Best’). 714

C. Maier et al

Due to the frequent cultivation of the highly sus-
ceptible cv. ‘Klosterneuburger Marille’, small-scale
structured apricot orchards and the close vicinity of
conifers as putative overwintering hosts for the vector
C. pruni disease incidence are high. The development
of a well-adapted pest management is an urgent need. Therefore, presence and temporal dynamics of
C. pruni on apricots, plums, blackthorns and cherry
plums were investigated. ESFY infection rates of
C. pruni and their Prunus host plants were also deter-
mined. To observe extent and speed of vector move-
ment and to estimate the size of the natural vector
population in a model apricot orchard a mark, release
and recapture study with remigrants was carried out. Material and Methods

Insect and plant sampling

Location and description of the experimental sites
included in the study are illustrated in Table 1. Exper-
imental sites 1-7 are located in the Wachau area. For
comparison purposes, two sites (N° 8 and 9) situated
apart from commercial apricot growing areas were
also included in this study. Adult C. pruni were captured from end of February
until beginning of July 2011 and 2012 on Prunus ar-
meniaca, P. domestica, P. spinosa and P. cerasifera nigra. In 2011, captures were made at test sites 1, 3, 5, 6, 7,8
and 9, and in 2012, presence of insects was surveyed
at sites 2, 8 and 9. Remigrants were collected once or
twice a week, and springtime generation adults were
collected every week or every 2 weeks using a beating
tray method with a white plastic tray (30 x 40 cm). Two branches per tree were chosen for insect collec-
tion and sampled by ten hits, respectively. Numbers of
sampled branches per tree were kept to this low level
to prevent unreliable data due to escape of insects. The
number of probed trees per experimental site ranged
from 2 to 5 for P. spinosa, 2 for P. domestica and 5 to 13
for P. armeniaca. In the case of P. cerasifera nigra, only
one tree was present at the experimental site. Trapped
psyllids were identified (according to Ossiannilsson
1992; Burckhardt and Jarausch 2007), counted and
frozen at —18°C. Additionally, yellow sticky traps (Re-
bell® amarillo, Andermatt Biocontrol AG, Grossdiet-
wil, Switzerland) were used in apricot orchards to
record the return of the remigrated C. pruni in early
spring and to proof their presence in orchards with
low population densities. In each orchard, 4 yellow
sticky traps were mounted and changed weekly. Leaf samples were taken in late summer 2011 and
2012 to analyse the presence of the phytoplasma at all

test sites in all four Prunus species. At this time of the
year, symptom bearing trees were present in all apri-
cot orchards included in this study. Observed symp-
toms were rolling and yellowing of leaves, reduced
vigour and death of entire trees or single branches. No
symptoms were observed on P. domestica, P. cerasifera
nigra and P. spinosa. To obtain an overview of infection rates, sampled
trees were randomly selected independently whether
they showed symptoms or not. Numbers of sampled
trees per orchard are presented in Table 2. Detection of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’

DNA extraction from plant and insect samples was
performed as described by Maixner et al. (1995). Each
plant or insect was processed individually. Insect and plant DNA (except P. spinosa DNA) were
amplified in a direct PCR procedure using the primer
pair £01/r01 (Lorenz et al. 1995). A 20 yl of reaction
volume contained 1-5 jl template preparation, 0.5 jum
of each primer, 200 ym of each dNTP, 0.5U Taq DNA
polymerase (Qiagen, Erlangen, Germany) and 1x
reaction buffer (Qiagen). PCR was performed in an Ep-
pendorf Mastercycler (Hamburg, Germany). The reac-
tion mixtures were subjected to 40 cycles with 45 s
denaturation at 94°C, 45 s annealing at 45°C and 60 s
extension at 72°C. All samples yielding the expected
PCR fragment were analysed by restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) to differentiate ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ from other 16SrX phytoplasmas and to
exclude unspecific PCR products. 10 jl of amplicon

was digested with 5U of Rsal (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) at 37°C for 4 h (Seemiiller and Schneider 2004). PCR and RFLP products were stained with Midori
Green (Nippon Genetics Europe, Dueren, Germany),
separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized under
UV light. P. spinosa samples were analysed by nested
PCR in 2011 and by qualitative real-time PCR in 2012. For nested PCR, the primers P1/P7 (Deng and Hiruki
1991; Smart et al. 1996) and f{01/r01 were used. Incu-
bation parameters were identical as described for
direct PCRs except for the annealing temperature in
the first amplification which was 50°C. For qualitative
real-time PCR, the Sensifast NoRox kit (Bioline, Lon-
don, UK) based on SYBR Green technology was used. Reaction preparations comprised 0.5 yl of template
DNA, 0.2 um of primers ESFYf and ESFYr (Yvon et al. 2009), 10 yl 2x Sensifast mix in a volume of 20 sl. 715

Real-time PCR was carried out in a Rotor Gene 2.0
(Corbett, Mortlake, Australia) thermocycler with a
denaturation step at 94°C for 3 min and 40 PCR cycles
with 5 s denaturation at 94°C, 10 s annealing at 65°
and 10 s extension at 72°C. Mark, release and recapture study

Remigrated C. pruni adults were collected on
P. spinosa at test site 9 by beating tray method. Mark-
ing was essentially performed as previously described
(Hagler and Jackson 2001; Nakata 2008); 50 speci-
mens at a time were transferred into 50-ml centrifuge
tubes and 5 mg of a pink luminescent powder pig-
ment (Karmin Tagesleucht pigment, Artmaxx, Berlin,
Germany) or 10 mg of a light blue luminescent pow-
der pigment (Guardi, Prussian blue UV active, Boes-
ner, Vienna, Austria) were added to each tube. Insects
were stained by gentle rolling and turning of the tube. Pigment-coated psyllids showed a pink or blue colour
under daylight and strong luminescence in the dark
under UV light. Stability of the dyes in the field was investigated by
transferring 10 dead, stained specimens per dye to a
yellow sticky trap exposed to outdoor conditions. Visibility of the stain in daylight and UV light was
examined weekly. Effects of the pigment on insect survival were exam-
ined by a laboratory experiment. 10 individuals at a
time (pigment coated or untreated) were caged in pot
cages (20 cm long, 15 cm wide) on apricot seedlings. Insects were kept under laboratory conditions (L16:
D8, 21°C). Numbers of dead and surviving individuals
were recorded daily for 8 days. The experiment was
repeated four times. Statistical analysis (Kruskal—
Wallis H Test) was performed by aid of the statistics
programs SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For the field experiments, the standard tree apricot
orchard at test site 2 (Table 1) was chosen. In this,
orchard within a row tree spacing ranged from 4-5 m,
while between rows distance was 6 m. A hedgerow
with hosts for C. pruni (P. domestica and P. cerasifera
nigra) was located at a distance of approximately
100-130 m. Numbers and arrangement of trees
included in the experiments are illustrated in Figs 4
and 5. The apricot orchard was surrounded by an apple
orchard in the South, a sports ground in the North,
a hedgerow with hosts for C. pruni in North-West and
an apricot orchard in the East. The model orchard
breadthways only comprised five rows. To ensure con-
ditions that can normally be found in bigger orchards,
the release tree was not chosen in the middle of the
apricot orchard but closer to the apple orchard than to

the sports ground. Wind and temperature measure-
ments were taken by a weather station (Adcon, Klo-
sterneuburg, Austria) present in close vicinity to the
apricot orchard. Measurements were taken three times
a day. The insect release was conducted twice (start
19th and 26th of April 2012). In the first release,
insects were stained with the pink fluorescent dye, for
the second release, the blue dye was used. 600 C. pruni
per release were trapped on P. spinosa, starved for 2 h,
stained and freed on one single tree in the apricot orch-
ard. At the beginning of the experiment, insects were
caged on four single branches using transparent plastic
tubes (20 cm long, 15 cm wide) with gauze houses on
both ends (50 individuals per cage). After the insects
had settled and started to feed, the plastic tubes were
removed (c. after 90 min). Movement of the stained
insects and presence of naturally occurring insects
within the orchard were monitored by yellow sticky
traps (2 traps per tree including the release tree) from
19th of April (release of the first stained insects) until
3rd of May (8 days after the second insect release). Positions of the sticky traps are illustrated in Figs 4 and
5. Trees within the model orchard were allocated to
sectors according to their distance to the release tree
(Figs 4 and 5). The approximate distances to the release
tree were 4~7 m for sector 1, 8-14 m for sector 2, 12-
21 m for sector 3 and 16-24 m for sector 4. During the
experiment, sticky traps were controlled at night using
a UV tube (portable bank note tester, Conrad, Vienna,
Austria). After the end of the experiment, all sticky
traps were transferred to the laboratory and inspected
under a binocular microscope and a standard UV
transilluminator (Vilber Lourmat, Marne-la-Vallée,
France). Results

Temporal dynamics of Cacopsylla pruni

The results of the insect captures on P. armeniaca,
P. domestica, P. spinosa and P. cerasifera nigra using the
beating tray method are as shown in Figs 1-3. In
2011, remigration of C. pruni to Prunus spp. started in
calendar week 10 (8th of March) and in 2012, in
calendar week 12 (18th of March). Remigrants were
observed until calendar week 20 (middle of May),
significant numbers of springtime generation adults
were present on Prunus until week 26 (end of June). Insect captures in apricot orchards were low. By the
beating tray method, on average, significantly less
than one specimen per sampling (10 hits per branch)
was trapped. On test sites, 1, 6 and 7 no C. pruni were
collected by this method. Yellow sticky traps, how-

trapped by beating tray method on P. spinosa in both
years and on P. cerasifera nigra in 2012. By far, the
highest numbers of C. pruni with average insect num-
bers exceeding 25 per sampling were found on
P. spinosa on test sites 8 and 9. Presence of ‘Ca, P. prunorum’ in plants and insects

Significant numbers of infected apricot and plum trees
were detected in all investigated orchards. Between
9.8 and 63.3% of the apricot samples and 20-40% of
the plum samples were infected. The pathogen was
also detected in P. spinosa at test sites 1 and 4 but not
in plants at sites 2, 6, 8 and 9 (Table 2). Infection rates
of remigrated C. pruni individuals ranged from 0 to
11.5%. 0 to 3.44% of the springtime generation
adults were also infected (Table 3). Mark, release and recapture study

After exposure of marked insects to outdoor condi-
tions on a yellow sticky trap for 5 weeks (precipitation
during this period 20.2 mm), the pink dye was still
clearly visible both in daylight and in UV light. All
stained specimens were identified. The light blue dye
was equally visible in UV light. In daylight with the
unaided eye, however, discrimination between blue
dye and dust on the sticky traps turned out difficult
already 1 week after the beginning of the experiment. Effects of the pigments on insect survival were
examined under laboratory conditions. Kruskal-
Wallis H test revealed no statistically significant differ-
ences between survival of unstained and stained
insects and between survival of insects coated with
the different pigments. O site 2 P. dom

The results of the two release experiments are illus-
trated in Figs 4 and 5. Six hundred marked insects per
experiment were released. In the first trial, 20 speci-
mens (3.3%) were recaptured within 15 days (19
within the orchard, 1 in the P. cerasifera nigra hedge-
row), in the second trial, 18 (3%) were trapped in the
orchard within 8 days. In both experiments, insect
spread occurred rapidly. In the first trial, marked
insects were observed on trees in sectors one and two
(on trees adjacent to the release point and also in the
next row of trees) within 1 day after release (covered
distance up to 10 m). In the second trial, marked
specimens were ascertained on trees in sector one and
three within 24h (up to 13 m from release tree). P. domestica in hedgerow

trates numbers of marked and unmarked psyllids on
the sticky traps in each sector of the orchard at the
end of the experiment. Neither strong winds nor a
prominent wind direction was present during the sur-
vey. The mornings were usually windless and wind
direction often changed during the day. Discussion

Our data, namely the numbers of C. pruni on wild
Prunus, the percentages of PCR-positive insects and
the infections of blackthorn bushes are signs of an
endemic disease spread in the investigated areas. Reports from Italy (Carraro et al. 2002) pointed out
that the diffuse presence of the phytoplasma in wild
Prunus spp. such as blackthorn allows an ESFY trans-
mission cycle independent from cultivated stone fruit
‘trees, Occasionally, transmissions from blackthorn
(or other wild Prunus species) to cultivated stone fruit
trees are likely to occur. We therefore conclude that
generally recommended management strategies such
as use of healthy planting material, orchard manage-
ment and eradication of infected fruit trees (Marcone
et al. 2010) alone will not suffice to manage ESFY in
the Wachau area. In our study, however, infection Fates of black>

bushes were colonized by high numbers of infected
insects in 2011 and 2012, and this had probably also
been the case in previous years. Consequently, the
question arises whether blackthorn is indeed a
favourable host of C. pruni but not very susceptible to

|ESFY. The quick epidemic disease spread in Austria
might therefore rather be pushed by infected culti-
vated Prunus trees allowing the development of
numerous infectious C. pruni than by blackthorn. The data on C. pruni population dynamics are simi-
lar to investigations in other European countries with
comparable climatic conditions (Labonne and Lichou
2004; Jarausch et al. 2007; Thébaud et al. 2009;
Ermacora et al. 2011). In 2011, remigration of the
overwintering adults in Lower Austria started
2 weeks earlier than in 2012. Comparisons with
weather data gathered at test site 2 (not shown) sug-
gest that the start of remigration was influenced by

the temperature profile. Hibernal temperatures in the
first half of March 2012 could have delayed remigra-
tion. In both years, we detected the first specimens on
Prunus more or less simultaneously at all test sites. Up
to now, overwintering sites in the investigated areas
of Austria were not known. Further work should
therefore focus on the identification of overwintering
sites. Recording both temperature profiles at these
sites and population densities on Prunus hosts might
perhaps allow conclusions on the influence of tem-
perature on migratory activity. Our PCR analyses showed considerable infection

‘Thébaud et al. 2009; Poggi Pollini et al. 2010). More-
over, it shows the urgent need for effective control
strategies against the remigrants. In contrast, only low

719

numbers of infected springtime generation insects
were observed. The majority of springtime generation
insects analysed in this work were collected on black-
thorn. In most of these host plants, the phytoplasma
was not detected, and consequently, our data do not
allow conclusions on the role of springtime genera-
tion psyllids on disease transmission. Further studies
with more springtime generation adults collected in
diseased apricot orchards are required. The incidence of new ESFY infections in an apricot
orchard depends on the number of vectors present,
on the infection rates of the insects as well as on insect
mobility and numbers of trees that are visited by one
individual. To estimate the number of remigrants in
an apricot orchard and to track their behaviour, the
mark release and recapture experiment was carried
out. Our tests showed that fluorescent dyes provide
an easy and effective marking tool for field studies on
/psyllid movement) The selected pigments were stable
for several weeks under outdoor conditions including
rain. The pink dye, however, was more suitable for
visual detection by bare eye than the light blue one. There was no detectable effect of the dyes on insect
survival. Moreover, in our field experiment, marked
individuals were able to survive for more than 8 days
and to fly >10 m within 24 h of their release. These
results coincide with previous works on the effect of a
pink fluorescent powder on the Asian citrus psyllid
(Diaphorina citri, Hemiptera: Psyllidae). The dye nei-
ther influenced survival nor significantly affected
flight behaviour (Nakata 2008). Similar results were
obtained by Coviella et al. (2006) who used several
fluorescent dusts for tracking the movement of the
glassy winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca coagulata,
Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). Marking experiments on
mountain pine beetles (Dentroctonus ponderosae,
Coleoptera: Cucurlionidae), however, showed that
fluorescent dyes did not reduce the viability of the
beetles but they influenced their physical condition. The authors presumed, therefore, that fluorescent
powders might affect optimal dispersal behaviour
(Reid and Reid 2008). Monitoring of C. pruni by the beating tray method
only allowed capture of few specimens, and in some
investigated orchards, insects were not ascertained. Use of yellow sticky traps proved the presence of the
insect species at all investigated sites, but still numbers
of captured specimen were low. In our mark and
capture study, numbers of unmarked psyllids on the
sticky traps between 19th of April and 3rd of May
were a multiple of the marked specimens in all sectors
of the model orchard. Numbers of marked insects per
release and per dye amounted to 600. Presuming that

720

C. Maier et al. unmarked and marked insects had the same chance
to be caught on the sticky traps, it can be concluded
that at least more than thousand C. pruni individuals
were naturally occurring in the model orchard. One
can easily imagine that in this orchard (test site 2)/thé

Before the experiment started, we noticed that a
simple transfer of insects to the release tree led to a
high number of insects dropping to the ground. To
accelerate settling and feeding of the marked insects
on the release tree and to minimize losses, insects
were starved for 2 h before the trial. Moreover, at the
beginning of the experiment, insects were caged on
the release tree in transparent plastic tubes. The tubes
were not removed until the insects had started to
feed. With this procedure, we were able to keep virtu-
ally all specimens on the tree. In our study, captures of marked C. pruni on the
sticky traps proved a fast and frequent tree-to-tree
movement. From our experiments, it cannot be
excluded that the dyes affected the condition of the
psyllids similarly to the mountain pine beetles. In this
case, however, dispersal of unmarked insects would
be even faster than observed for the stained ones. All
in all, it seems likely that one infectious individual
present in an orchard visits and infects several apricot
trees. other release experiments with psyllids. Van den Berg
and Deacon (1988), for example, released a total of
25.000 Trioza erytreae in two experiments. The authors
studied insect dispersal without host plants in

ploughed land of 3 x 2.5 km. (Kobori/@tial(2011)

intervals. Both studies were carried out with newly
hatched adults. T. erytreae and D. citri are multivoltine,
complete their whole life cycle on Citrus spp. or other
Rutaceae and produce high numbers of progeny. Insects can readily be reared or obtained in the field in
high numbers (Annecke and Cilliers 1963; Van den
Berg and Deacon 1988; Hall et al. 2012). In contrast,
Cacopsylla pruni is a univoltine species hibernating on
conifers. In our laboratory-rearing experiments, field-
captured C. pruni produced high numbers of eggs
which developed into numerous springtime genera-
tion adults. Migration to conifers and hibernation
under laboratory conditions, however, proved difficult
(data not shown). Rearing of significant numbers of

remigrants seemed hardly possible. As already stated,
the remigrants are considered as crucial disease vec-
tors. Therefore, we studied their dispersal behaviour in
the mark and recapture experiments. Consequently,
insects were captured in field where their occurrence
was limited. Compared with the citrus experiments
mentioned above, our experiments not only comprised
lower number of released insects, they were also car-

ried out in a smaller test plot. So the recapture rate of

‘released insects would have been desirable. In the
release experiments with T. erytreae and D. citri, the
authors observed a prominent role of prevailing winds
on psyllid dispersal (Van den Berg and Deacon 1988;
Kobori et al. 2011). In our study, neither strong winds
nor a prominent wind direction was present during the
survey. Nevertheless, it can be presumed that stronger
winds would have enhanced dispersal of C. pruni in a
similar manner to T. erytreae and D. citri. ESFY transmission experiments in the greenhouse
revealed a minimum inoculation period of 1-2 days
(Carraro et al. 2001). Our data show a considerable
tree-to-tree movement of the remigrants. In theory, a
fast acting, enduring insecticide should therefore
decrease inoculation of the trees, reduce insect num-
bers in orchards, downsize movement of the vectors
from tree to tree and in the end diminish rates of new
infections. Practical experiments with insecticide
applications, however, showed inconclusive results. Effects of the treatments on disease spread were only
detected in the minority of tests (Poggi Pollini et al. 2007). Mark and recapture experiments might allow
observation of the effects of possible insecticide appli-
cations on psyllid survival and movement. In this
way, they could contribute to the development of
appropriate management strategies. Acknowledgements
