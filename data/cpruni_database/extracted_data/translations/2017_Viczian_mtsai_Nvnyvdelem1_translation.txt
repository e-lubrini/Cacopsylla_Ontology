In our country, the destruction of apricots has become more and more worrying, for which the ‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum ’(CCP )6 is the answer. The disease is caused by the European bulge of stonefish
(ESFY), which causes severe losses in many shellfish
also in the plum, peach and apricot regions of southern Europe. To the best of our knowledge, the

European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) caused by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ (CPP) is
prevalent in the now important stone fruit production areas of Central and Southern Europe. It is
One of the most important diseases of apricot is several growing sites in Hungary. With our recent
knowledge of this pathogen can be transmitted and spread by propagation material and the psyllid vector,
Cacopsylla pruni. Only a few data on the life cycle and population dynamics of Cacopsylla spp. tendon
Hungary are available and only one study has been performed to survey the role of C. pruni in ESFY
epidemiology. For the time being there is no way to cure this disease or only calm the symptoms, so we
must emphasize the prevention. In the 2014-2016 years, C. pruni individuals were collected on apricot
(P. armeniaca), myrabolan (P. cerasifera), blackthorn (P. spinosa) and other Prunus species. We tried
to capture them on their wintering conifer hosts as well. Concerning phytoplasma infection of the spe-
cies captured in the studied orchards, our results showed that individuals of C. pruni were infected by
‘Ca. P. prunorum is the overwintering as well as in the new generation. Well known that two strongly,
genetically differentiated, but morphologically similar groups of Cacopsylla pruni (A and B) exist. All
the collected insects could be unambiguously defined into the genetic group B.
