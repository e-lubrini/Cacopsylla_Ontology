Abstract

The incidence of individuals of Cacopsylla pruni infected with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ was analysed by PCR/RFLP
in single insects captured during a growing season in selected apricot plantations in southern Moravia (Czech Republic). A por-
tion of adults of both overwintering and new generation of the psyllid was determined as positive for the phytoplasma presence. It
was found that conifers growing in the investigated hilly sites of middle Moravia harbour C. pruni during the winter season. The
presence of the phytoplasma positive individuals of the species was determined in 3 of 4 batches of specimens from overwintering

   

sites,

‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ (formerly Euro-
pean stone fruit yellows phytoplasma) is one of the most
important fruit tree phytoplasmas causing serious dam-
ages in cultivated Prunus species in Europe. In the
Czech Republic the pathogen occurs in warmer habitats
in southern Moravia (Navratil er a/., 1998) that consti-
tutes a considerable apricot and peach production area
within the country. The psyllid Cacopsylla pruni Scopoli was described
as vector of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ by
Carraro et al. (1998, 2001). The species is abundant and
widely distributed over the Moravian region. C. pruni is
narrowly oligophagous on Prunus species, whereas wild
Prunus plants, mainly blackthorn (P. spinosa), are its
preferred host plants (Lauterer, 1999). The psyllid is
monovoltine and hibernates at adult stage on shelter
plants, mainly conifers. The aim of the work was to determine the occurrence
of C. pruni inside selected apricot plantations and the
incidence of individuals positive for “Ca. P. prunorum’. A further objective was to assess the presence and the
phytoplasma infection of the psyllids from overwinter-
ing habitats. Materials and methods

Insects were caught using sweep-netting during vegeta-
tion season of 2006 every two weeks between beginning
of April and mid-July in apricot trees in three sites lo-
cated in the southern Moravia region: in two experimen-
tal apricot plantations (designated as L-g and L-m) in
Lednice location (altitude 176 m a.s.l.) and in a com-
mercial apricot orchard in Velké Néméice (VN) location
(altitude 184 m a.s.1.). The sample collection unit is de-
fined as number of individuals of a species obtained by

sweep-netting of 45 trees. After identification, adults of
C. pruni were stored in absolute ethanol (-20°C) until
tested for determining phytoplasma presence. Other
captures of hemipteran insects were performed during
the winter season monthly from November 2006 to Feb-
ruary 2007 in middle Moravia region on conifers
(Picea) in hilly sites of Drahanska vrchovina Highland
(altitude between 480 and 530 maz.s.l.). The adults of C.
pruni were stored in absolute ethanol (—20°C) until
tested. The extracts of total DNA from single psyllid indi-
viduals were obtained using a commercial kit (Wizard
Genomic DNA Purification Kit, Promega, USA). The
detection of phytoplasmas in single individuals of C.
pruni was performed using nested-PCR with universal
primers R16F1/RO and R16F2/R2 (Lee et al., 1995) de-
rived from 16S rDNA. Amplification products obtained
with primers R16F2/R2 were subjected to digestion
with Rsal, Bfml, and Alu (Fermentas, Lithuania) re-
striction endonucleases. Results

The species C. pruni occurred in observed apricot or-
chards from the beginning of April till the end of June
2006. The numbers of psyllids caught on apricots during
the growing season 2006 are reported in table 1. The
psyllids were more abundant inside both apricot planta-
tions in Lednice location, with the peak in the numbers
of captured individuals from mid-April to beginning of
May. As regards with the new generation of C. pruni
inside the location, maximal numbers were collected at
the end of June. Very low numbers of C. pruni were
collected in the apricot orchard in Velké Néméice loca-
tion. The results of phytoplasma detection in the indi-
viduals of C. pruni captured in apricot trees during the
growing season are shown in table 1. Table 1. Results of detection of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in C.

Individuals of C. pruni were regularly collected on
conifers at the investigated hilly sites from November
2006 to February 2007. The presence of ‘Ca. P. prun-
orum’ positive individuals of C. pruni was found in 3
out of 4 batches tested (see table 2). Discussion

In France, Yvon et al. (2004) reported detection of two
ESFY phytoplasma positive individuals of C. pruni
from natural populations overwintering on conifers. We
found phytoplasma positive individuals of C. pruni
among adults captured in the winter season on Picea
trees growing in elevations of the Drahanska vrchovina
Highland. In view of the relatively high numbers of C.
pruni adults and other members of the genus collected
during the winter period from the sites, we can consider
the location as an important overwintering site for psyl-
lids in the Czech Republic conditions. It must be men-
tioned that the location is situated far (several tens of
kilometres) from the main area of stone fruit tree pro-
duction. However, it is proposed that psyllids can mi-
grate for a long distance. Concordantly, overwintering
sites of C. pruni have been referred to be located in
mountainous sites far away from the area with Prunus
orchards (Yvon et al., 2004). The authors still remarked
that C. pruni has not been found to overwinter on coni-
fers in the lower altitude area with a blackthorn hedge. Likewise, Poggi Pollini et al. (2004) in Italy collected
no specimens of the species during the winter captures
on conifers surrounding the areas where the disease has
been found in recent years. 184

Concerning phytoplasma infection of the species cap-
tured in the studied apricot plantations, our results show
that individuals of C. pruni positive for ‘Ca. P. prun-
orum’ are present in the overwintering as well as in the
new generation. These results fit with the findings of
other studies that both generations are infected but some
authors (Thébaud et a/., 2007) considered the overwin-
tering generation as more important in the phytoplasma
transmission. In conclusion, our findings indicate that in the Czech
conditions the psyllid C. pruni can act as a reservoir of
"Ca. P. prunorum’ during the growing season as well as
during the winter. Acknowledgements
