Entomology, Brno, Czech Republic        Abstract    We studied the overwintering of psyllids on conifers in two hilly sites in the Czech Republic, South Moravia: the Drahansk\u00e1  vrchovina Highlands and the Pavlovsk\u00e9 vrchy Hills. Using a sweeping net on a long stick we collected altogether 3304 specimens  of Psylloidea. In the Drahansk\u00e1 vrchovina, 27 species were found; 80 % of specimens belonged to the potential phytoplasma vec- tors Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli), Cacopsylla picta (F\u00f6rster), Cacopsylla melanoneura (F\u00f6rster), and Cacopsylla pyrisuga (F\u00f6r- ster). In the Pavlovsk\u00e9 vrchy, 10 species were ascertained and C. melanoneura as the only phytoplasma vector was represented in  2.9 % of specimens. A high representation of phytoplasma vectors on conifers in the Moravian highlands can be explained by a  long-distance migration of freshly mature psyllid specimens which would be carried from lowlands by ascending thermic cur- rents, drifted by winds and deposited on hills by turbulence.    Key words: Cacopsylla, phytoplasma vectors, overwintering, migration.      Introduction    A few species from the psyllid genus Cacopsylla (He- miptera Psyllidae) have recently proved to be vectors of  phytoplasmas, which belong to the apple proliferation  cluster and seriously damage fruit trees (Tedeschi et al.,  2002; Frisinghelli et al., 2000; Carraro et al., 1998;  Grbic, 1974). Of these, Cacopsylla melanoneura (F\u00f6r- ster), Cacopsylla picta (F\u00f6rster), Cacopsylla pruni  (Scopoli) and Cacopsylla pyrisuga (F\u00f6rster) can be im- portant vectors in the Czech Republic. These species  overwinter in the adult stage and like most psyllids with  a similar life cycle, they may be found on conifers dur- ing the winter. However, they have been so far collected  by most authors on conifers only rarely and in low  numbers (Tedeschi et al. 2002). The four above men- tioned species occur frequently on their host plants in  the lowlands of South Moravia (south-eastern part of the  Czech Republic) (Lauterer, 1999) but are mostly absent  in few artificially planted lowland conifer stands in their  vicinity. Recently, we have focused on locating over- wintering sites and monitoring migration of psyllids in  South Moravia. We have supposed that lowland psyllids  might migrate to overwintering sites situated on more  distant hills.      Materials and methods    We collected overwintering psyllids on conifers at two  hilly sites in South Moravia in 2005-2007: (A) the \u010cer- ven\u00fd vrch and the Kale\u010dn\u00edk Hills in the Drahansk\u00e1  vrchovina Highland (49\u00b0 15\u2019 N, 16\u00b0 50\u2019 E, 479-535 m  a.s.l.) on spruce; (B) the top of the P\u00e1lava Hill in the  Pavlovsk\u00e9 vrchy Hills (48\u00b0 52\u2019 N, 16\u00b0 39\u2019 E, 462 m  a.s.l.) on pine trees. The site A was visited on 5 and 18  March 2006 and then regularly each month from August  2006 till June 2007, the site B was visited twice on 4  December 2005 and 19 March 2006. On each date psyl- lids were collected with the same time-limited sampling  effort (5 hours) using a sweep net on a 5 m long stick. In  total, the samples included 3304 specimens of Psyl- loidea (Site A: 3029 specimens, Site B: 275 specimens).      Results and discussion    Altogether, we found 27 species of Psylloidea (i.e. 22% of  the Czech fauna), including all the four vectors, over- wintering on spruce at site A, while only 10 psyllid spe- cies (8%) were collected on pine trees at site B where  only C. melanoneura was recorded from the vector spe- cies. The following species were found at site A: C.  melanoneura (65.4%), C. pruni (11.1%), Trioza remota  F\u00f6rster (7.8%), C. picta (2.2%), Trioza urticae (L.)  (2.2%), Aphalara maculipennis L\u00f6w (1.4%), Cacop- sylla brunneipennis (Edwards) (1.7%), C. pyrisuga  (1.3%), Cacopsylla pulchra (Zetterstedt) (1.1%), Ca- copsylla saliceti (F\u00f6rster) (1.1%), Aphalara avicularis  Ossiannilsson,  Aphalara  crispicola  Ossiannilsson,  Aphalara freji Burckardt et Lauterer, Aphalara polygoni  F\u00f6rster, Bactericera albiventris (F\u00f6rster), Bactericera  nigricornis (F\u00f6rster), Cacopsylla affinis (L\u00f6w), Cacop- sylla crataegi (Schrank), Cacopsylla elegantula (Zet- terstedt), Cacopsylla moscovita (Andrianova), C. pul- chra, Cacopsylla rhamnicola (Scott), Trioza apicalis  F\u00f6rster, Trioza flavipennis F\u00f6rster, Trioza rhamni  (Schrank) and Trioza rotundata Flor (all less than 1%).  At site B, the samples included T. remota (49.8%), B.  albiventris (12.0%), B. nigricornis (10.2%), T. urticae  (11.6%), C. pulchra (5.8%), C. saliceti (5.8%), C.  melanoneura (2.9%), Bactericera curvatinervis (F\u00f6r- ster), C. crataegi and C. rhamnicola (all less than 1%).  Despite a lower number of samples from pines we sug-     148 gest that spruce trees can be prefered over pines as shel- ter plants by the overwintering psyllids in South Mora- via. However, e.g. C. picta was frequently found to  overwinter on pines in Bulgaria (Harisanov, 1966).  The spring migration of psyllids from conifers onto  host plants starts at the beginning of March. The migra- tion of a new psyllid generation from host plants back  onto conifers takes place one week after adult emer- gence, ca. at the end of May for C. brunneipennis, C.  melanoneura and C. pulchra, and in June for C. picta,  C. pruni, C. pyrisuga and C. rhamnicola.  We suggest that the migration of psyllids onto conifers  would follow the \u201chilltopping\u201d principle. Accordingly,  the vector Cacopsylla spp. would be passively carried  by ascending aerial currents rising from unevenly  heated land surface in warm summer days up to tens of  kilometres away from the host plants in lowlands and  deposited on tree tops when the currents reach moun- tains or hills and lose their carrying capacity in turbu- lences. Psyllid individuals might consequently actively  search for appropriate conifer trees to overwinter. Such  aerial currents, which would be suitable for passive  psyllid migration rise only in the long day period (June\u2013 August) between 11 a.m. and 4-5 p.m. At that period  south and south-east winds prevail in the studied region  and predetermined psyllid migration ways. The ascend- ing currents don\u2019t rise in the short day period, hence  those psyllid species in which adults of a new genera- tion appear too early (April-May) or too late (Septem- ber-November) can migrate only to short distances.  In order to investigate psyllids which overwinter on  conifers we recommend sampling the trees at a height of  at least 5 m above ground. The use of a long stick  brought samples richer in species and individuals than  beating the lowest tree branches.
