Plant sap feeding insects like psyllids are known to be vectors of phloem dwelling
bacteria (‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ and ‘Ca. Liberibacter’), plant pathogens which
cause severe diseases and economically important crop damage. Some univoltine
psyllid species have a particular life cycle, within one generation they alternate two times
between different host plant species. The plum psyllid Cacopsylla pruni, the vector of
European Stone Fruit Yellows (ESFY), one of the most serious pests in European fruit
production, migrates to stone fruit orchards (Prunus spp.) for mating and oviposition
in early spring. The young adults of the new generation leave the Prunus trees in
summer and emigrate to their overwintering hosts like spruce and other conifers. Very
little is known about the factors responsible for the regulation of migration, reasons
for host alternation, and the behavior of psyllids during their phase of life on conifers. Because insect feeding behavior and host acceptance is driven by different biotic
factors, such as olfactory and gustatory cues as well as mechanical barriers, we carried
out electrical penetration graph (EPG) recordings and survival bioassays with C. pruni
on different conifer species as potential overwintering hosts and analyzed the chemical
composition of the respective plant saps. We are the first to show that migrating psyllids
do feed on overwintering hosts and that nymphs are able to ingest phloem and xylem
sap of coniferous trees, but cannot develop on conifer diet. Analyses of plant saps
reveal qualitative differences in the chemical composition between coniferous trees and
Prunus as well as within conifer species. These differences are discussed with regard
to nutritional needs of psyllid nymphs for proper development, overwintering needs of
adults and restriction of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ to Prunus phloem. Keywords: phloem, chemical composition, psyllid, development, overwintering, host alternation, migration,

INTRODUCTION

Phloem and xylem tissue enables plants to allocate their resources from sources to sinks and
distribute phytohormones to regulate physiological processes. Especially the phloem is rich in
nutrients (Douglas, 2006), making it a suitable food source for sap-sucking insects. Although
mechanical barriers like sclerenchymatous fibrous rings are able to hinder phloem-feeders from

Host Plant Alternation of C. pruni

 

reaching the vascular bundles (George et al., 2017), the phloem
is poorly chemically defended (Douglas, 2006). Since decades
studies focused on the chemical composition of phloem sap and
the nutrition of phloem-feeding insects. Most work was done in
the field of crops, such as rice (Fukumorita and Chino, 1982),
broad bean, clover, and peas (Sandstrém and Pettersson, 1994;
Wilkinson and Douglas, 2003) and their pests (especially aphids),
because of the economic importance and the role of aphids as
model organisms. Information about the composition of phloem
and xylem sap of coniferous plants is rare. Ziegler and Mittler
(1959) extracted phloem sap from Picea abies by stylectomy
and found sucrose as the only sugar in paper chromatography
analysis. Later studies focused on induced defense mechanisms
in bark phloem after bark beetle attack (Rohde et al., 1996),
food quality of needles (Schopf et al., 1982; Fisher and Fisher,
1987) and impact of air pollution on nutrition of conifers
(Zedler et al., 1986; Kainulainen et al., 1993). These studies
give an impression of which metabolites could be found in
plant sap of coniferous trees, but compounds were extracted
from whole plant tissue (bark resp. needles). More explicit
knowledge about plant sap composition is important for a better
understanding of the biology of phloem-feeding insects that
migrate between two different host plant species, e.g., psyllids
(Hemiptera: Psyllidae). Psyllids or jumping plant lice are plant sap feeding insects
encompassing more than 3000 species. Most of them are
oligophagous and use perennial dicotyledonous angiosperms as
host plants for reproduction (Hodkinson, 2009; Mayer et al.,
2009, 2011). In the genus Cacopsylla two different strategies
can be observed: There are polyvoltine species reproducing and
feeding exclusively on the same host plant and univoltine species
with an obligate alternation of two host plants (Ossiannilsson,
1992; Hodkinson, 2009). The latter migrate between their
reproduction host plants (respective fruit crops) and their
overwintering host plants (conifers) (Mayer and Gross, 2007;
Mayer et al., 2011). For identifying their particular host plants
for feeding and reproduction, volatile signals are used in many
species during migration (Soroker et al., 2004; Gross and
Mekonen, 2005; Mayer et al., 2008a,b, 2009; Weintraub and
Gross, 2013). The plum psyllid, Cacopsylla pruni is the only known vector of
one of the most serious pests in European fruit production, the
cell wall lacking bacterium ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’
(Carraro et al., 1998). The phloem dwelling bacterium induces the
European Stone Fruit Yellows (ESFY) (Seemiiller and Schneider,
2004). Because infected trees yield poorly and die quickly, this
plant disease causes high economic losses in European fruit
production every year. So far no curative approach was found
against this disease. Unfortunately, it is not possible to cultivate
this obligate cell parasite outside of the host plant or vector, which
hampers research toward a cure. Therefore, the only measure to
inhibit infection of stone fruit orchards is to prevent invasion
of the vector insect, as C. pruni alternates between Prunus spp. and coniferous trees during its life cycle. After reproduction and
development on Prunus spp., the young adults (emigrant stage)
emigrate and spend the rest of the year on spruce and other
conifers (Thébaud et al., 2009; Jarausch and Jarausch, 2016). Frontiers in Plant

In early spring they return to Prunus spp. for reproduction
(remigrant stage). Very little is known about the reason for
migration and feeding behavior of psyllids during their life on
conifers (Thébaud et al., 2009). To date it remains unclear
whether overwintering psyllids actually feed on conifers. Former
experiments with the closely related hawthorn psyllid Cacopsylla
melanoneura failed, although the maintenance of body condition
and level of hydration suggested feeding (Jackson et al., 1990). Because it was shown that adult C. pruni did not survive
the winter on one of their reproduction hosts Prunus spinosa
(Carraro et al. 2002; Thébaud et al., 2009), and that some
migrating species including C. pruni already start migration
to their overwintering host during summer (Mayer and Gross,
2007; Mayer et al., 2009; Jarausch and Jarausch, 2016), we
hypothesize that C. pruni needs to feed on overwintering host
plants during this long period and therefore needs to leave
deciduous Prunus trees to migrate to evergreen conifers, which
show yearlong photosynthesis and phloem activity. On the other
hand, reproduction on coniferous trees could be impossible for
C. pruni, forcing them to migrate back to Prunus. A better
knowledge of the vector biology is needed to develop new
control strategies against vector insects and bacterial pathogens
(Gross and Giindermann, 2016; Perilla-Henao and Casteel,
2016). Here, we studied the feeding behavior of adults and nymphs on
several conifer species as well as Prunus domestica, and conducted
bioassays to unveil C. pruni’s ability to survive and develop on
plant sap of overwintering hosts. Furthermore, we extracted the
phloem/xylem sap of both Prunus spp. and conifers and analyzed
sugars and organic acids including amino acids. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Insects

Cacopsylla pruni remigrants (overwintered adults) were caught
by beating tray method from Prunus domestica trees located
at the experimental field of the Julius Kiihn-Institut in
Dossenheim, Germany and at an experimental orchard of
Dienstleistungszentrum Landlicher Raum Rheinpfalz, Neustadt
an der Weinstrasse, Germany in spring 2017. Psyllids were
maintained on Prunus trees (cv. GF655/2 and Prunus spinosa) in
cages housed in a climate chamber at 20°C during photophase
and 16°C during scotophase (L16:D8). After mating and
oviposition the field captured adults were transferred to cages
with fresh plants. For survival experiments about 200 fifth instar
nymphs were gently transferred to a new P. domestica (cv. Wavit)
tree and emerged adults (emigrants) were collected daily. Plants

Four conifer species, Abies alba (Silver fir), Larix decidua
(European larch), Picea abies (Norway spruce), and Pinus
sylvestris (Scots pine), and the P. domestica cultivar Wavit were
used for experiments. Plants were grown under natural
conditions in an insect safe environment. Hexythiazox

April 2017 to prevent infestation with spider mites. EPG-Recordings

To investigate whether C. pruni adults and nymphs feed on
coniferous trees in general, the electrical penetration graph
technique (EPG) was applied. EPGs were recorded using an 8
channel amplifier (model Giga-8d, EPG-Systems, Wageningen,
Netherlands). Data acquisition and analysis was performed with
Stylet+ software (EPG-Systems). To connect the psyllids to
a copper electrode, a piece of fine gold wire (18 jm) was
attached to the pronotum with a small droplet of water based
silver glue (EPG-Systems). The electrode was attached to an
EPG probe and the reference electrodes were placed in the
soil of the test plants. Feeding behavior of C. pruni male and
female emigrants (minimum age 6 weeks) was recorded in a
climate chamber at 10°C with 60-65% RH for 16 h and of fifth
instar nymphs (about 6 weeks old) at 20°C under the same
conditions. Plants and insects were housed in a grounded self-
constructed Faraday cage during recordings. Recordings were
replicated 10 times for nymphs on each P. abies, A. alba, and
P. domestica (cv. Wavit). Feeding behavior of emigrants was
recorded on P. sylvestris (4 males and 6 females), P. abies (6
males and 4 females), A. alba (5 males and 5 females), and
L. decudia (6 males and 4 females). To ensure that emigrants
used for EPG recordings were not repelled by conifers (due
to their developmental stage), C. pruni adults were caged with
P. abies and A. alba twigs one day prior recordings and only
emigrants which were found on conifer twigs were chosen for
the experiment. Recordings were examined for occurrence of
stylet penetration and waveforms indicating phloem and xylem
uptake according to Bonani et al. (2010) and Civolani et al
(2011). Bioassays

Survival

Survival of emigrants was studied on P. abies, A. alba, and
P. domestica cv. Wavit plants. Transparent plastic cups (0.51
capacity) were used as cages. The bottom of each cup was
replaced by gauze for venting. A hole was punched into the lids
to attach the cups on twigs of living plants. The lid was sealed
with self-made modeling clay (composed of 42.6% water, 42.6%
flour, 3.2% sunflower oil, 10.6% salt, and 1.1% citric acid) and
five newly emerged emigrants (<24 h) were released in each
cup. Living individuals were recorded daily over a period of
40 days. Additionally, the mortality of emigrants in the same
type of cups, but without food supply (control), was observed. The experiment was replicated eight times for every plant
species and five times without plants (control) under rearing
conditions. Development

For developmental experiments C. pruni nymphs of second and
third instar were gently transferred with a fine brush from
rearing plants to twigs with young flush of P. abies, A. alba,
or P. domestica cy. Wavit, respectively. On each plant, five
nymphs were caged in insect rearing sleeves (40 cm x 20 cm,

100 x 80 mesh/square inch, MegaView, Taiwan). The experiment
was replicated seven times on each conifer species and five
times on cv. Wavit. Experimental plants were housed under
rearing conditions in a climate chamber. After 21 days cages were
controlled consistently once a week for hatched C. pruni adults
(emigrants). After 56 days all cages were opened and checked for
living nymphs. Xylem and Phloem Sap Sampling

Phloem and xylem saps were collected in June 2017 using
modified centrifugation technique according to Hijaz and Killiny
(2014). The twigs from young flush from P. domestica (cv. Wavit)
and conifer species P. abies, A. alba, L. deciduas, and P. sylvestris
were sliced into 2-3 cm pieces with a clean scalpel. The bottom
of a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube was removed with a razor blade and
twig pieces were placed into the tube. The tube was immersed in
a 1.5 ml tube. For collecting the phloem and xylem sap, the tubes
were centrifuged at 12.000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The collected
samples were stored at —80°C up to analysis. In the following,
this collected mixture of phloem and xylem sap is referred as
plant sap. Plant Sap Derivatization

The sap samples were derivatized with methyl chloroformate
(MCF) to focus the GC-MS analysis on amino and other organic
acids (Smart et al., 2010). An aliquot of 20 11 plant sap was mixed
with 180 j11 sodium hydroxide (1 M) ina silanized glass vial. Then
167 1 methanol and 34 1l pyridine were added, followed by
20 tl MCE. The sample was vortexed for exactly 30 s, additionally
20 jul MCF were added and the sample was mixed again for 30 s.
To extract the alkylated derivatives 150 jl chloroform were added
to each sample and mixed for another 10 s. A 200 il aliquot
of sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mM) was added and mixed
for 10 s again. After a double meniscus was formed, the aqueous
phase was discarded and a few milligrams of anhydrous sodium
sulfate were added to the organic layer to bind the remaining
water. The supernatant was transferred to a GC-MS vial with a
glass insert. For the derivatization with trimethylsilyl (TMS) 5 j11 aliquots
of the sap samples were added to 60 il of an internal standard
solution (Ribitol in ultrapure water) and dried under nitrogen
stream (Reacti-Vap, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham,
MA, United States). Samples were derivatized by adding 70 Ll
methoxyamine hydrochloride solution (MOX) in pyridine (2%)
and allow to incubate for 90 min at 37°C stirring at adjustment
of 7 (Reacti-Therm, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). 90 jl
of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) were
added and the silylation was allowed to react for 60 min at
37°C stirring at adjustment of 7 (Reacti-Therm, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.). The supernatant was transferred to a GC-MS vial
with a glass insert. Chemical Analysis

Derivatized samples were analyzed by gas chromatography
coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a PerkinElmer
Clarus R 680 GC system coupled to a PerkinElmer quadrupole
inert mass selective detector for molecular structure analysis. April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 484

A non-polar Elite-SMS (Crossbond 5% diphenyl-95% dimethyl
polysiloxane, PerkinElmer) capillary column (30 x 0.25 mm
id x 0.25 jum film thickness) was used for GC separation. Carrier
gas flow rate (Helium, Linde, Germany) was about 5 ml/min
(column head pressure 150 kPa). Injection of 1 1] of the samples
derivatized with MCF was done at 290°C injector temperature
with a split flow of 1 ml/min. The initial oven temperature of
70°C was held for 3 min, followed by a temperature increase
of 20°C/min up to 240°C held for 3.5 min and a further
increase to 300°C at a rate of 20°C/min. The final temperature
of 300°C was held for 2 min. The GC temperature program to
analyze samples after silylation was as follows: the initial oven
temperature of 80°C was held for 3 min, followed by an increase
of 5°C/min up to 320°C. The final temperature of 320°C was
held for 4 min. One microliter of each sample was injected
at 220°C with a split flow of 5 ml/min. Transfer line and ion
source temperatures were set to 250°C and 180°C, respectively. ‘The quadrupole mass detector was operated in electron-impact
(ED) mode at 70 eV. All data were obtained by collecting the
full-scan mass spectra within the range of 35-550 m/z. Blank

GC-MS chromatograms were analyzed using “Automated Mass
spectral Deconvolution and Identification System” (AMDIS,
V. 2.71; National Institute of Standards and Technology
NIST, Boulder, CO, United States). Detected compounds
were identified by comparing characteristic ion fragmentation
patterns, retention times and retention indices with standard
compounds according to Weintraub and Gross (2013). For
quantification, the peak areas were integrated after deconvolution
with AMDIS. Identification criteria were applied as follows:
match factor had to be >80% and the relative retention
index deviation <5% from reference value. The settings for
deconvolution were: component width: 32; adjacent peak
subtraction: one; resolution: medium; sensitivity: medium; shape
requirements: high; level: strong; maximum penalty: 20, and

‘no RI in library’: 20. Methionine, threonine, and serin were
only found in traces (match < 80) and were therefore excluded
from the analysis. Relative proportions of amino and organic
acids were calculated by setting the sum of the selected
compounds as 100%. Proportions of detected compounds after
‘TMS derivatization were normalized to internal standard. Chemicals and Standards

Alanine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, histidine, leucine,
lysine, proline, threonine, tryptophan, valine, salicylic acid,
pyridine, methanol, chloroform, methyl chloroformate (MCF),
sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, methoxyamine, ribitol,
myo-inositol, xylose, pinitol, and iso-leucine were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Munich, Germany). Arginine and phenylalanine were purchased from SERVA
Electrophoresis GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany). Glycine,
methionine, serine, malic acid, caffeic acid, succinic acid,
arabinose, and saccharose from Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG
(Karlsruhe, Germany). Asparagine, mannitol, glucose, and
galactose from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Sorbitol
and glutamine from AppliChem GmbH (Darmstadt, Germany). MSTFA from Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG (Diiren,
Germany). Citric acid was purchased from Acros Organics
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Geel, Belgium). Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was done in R version 3.4.2 “Short Summer”
(R Core Team, 2017). Visualizations were conducted with the
ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2009). Death hazard from C. pruni
emigrants on different host plants were compared by Cox’s
proportional hazard regression through likelihood ratio test. Efron approximation was used for tie handling. The proportional
hazards assumption for Cox regression model fit was confirmed
using the cox.zph function of the survival package (Therneau,
2017). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots were
used to visualize Bray-Curtis dissimilarities of the chemical
composition of xylem and phloem between plant species. NMDS
was performed using the metaMDS function from vegan package
(Oksanen et al., 2017). Scaling was standardized by Wisconsin
double standardization. Significantly (p < 0.01, N = 10000)
influential factors (chemical compounds) were plotted as
arrows in NMDS plots. Dissimilarity matrix was calculated
to test for discrimination of plant species by Permutational
Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA). Additionally,
the dispersion of groups was tested for multivariate homogeneity
(PERMDISP). RESULTS
EPG-Recordings

To determine if C. pruni feeds on overwintering hosts (conifers),
feeding behavior of emigrants was recorded on potential host
plants. The recordings revealed that both male and female
emigrants fed on plant saps of all four offered conifers: P. abies,
A. alba, P. sylvestris, and L. decudia. Recordings from nymphs of

C. pruni showed that they were also able to feed on P. abies and
A. alba (Figure 1). Bioassays

Survival

Newly emerged C. pruni emigrants survived on P. abies and
A. alba as long as on P. domestica cv. Wavit (Figure 2). The Cox
regression model showed that death hazard differed significantly
between host plants and controls without food supply (likelihood
ratio = 81.76, df = 3, R? = 0.431, p < 0.001). Death hazard for
emigrants fed on P. domestica cv. Wavit did not differ from

Host Plant Alternation of C. pruni

 

P. abies (likelihood ratio = 81.76, df = 3, R? = 0.431, p = 0.803)
and A. alba (likelihood ratio = 81.76, df = 3, R? = 0.431,
Pp = 0.846). Emigrants on all three potential host plant species
had a significant lower death hazard than psyllids without food
(control). The hazard ratio was reduced by 97, 97, and 96% if
C. pruni was allowed to feed on P. abies, A. alba, or P. domestica
cv. Wavit, respectively. Development

After 56 days 92% of the C. pruni nymphs on P. domestica cv. Wavit emerged while none of the nymphs developed neither on
P. abies nor A. alba (Figure 3). As no living nymphs could be
found on the coniferous trees, we conclude that they all died in
nymphal stage. Chemical Composition of Phloem and
Xylem Content

Plant species differed significantly in the chemical composition
of sugars and other compounds detected by GC-MS analysis
after TMS derivatization of plant sap (PERMANOVA, df = 4,
R? = 60.83, N = 10000, P < 0.001). The dispersions differed not
significantly between the groups (PERMDISP, df = 4, F = 0.42,
N = 10000, P > 0.05), confirming that separation of species was
due to their location. The NMDS plot illustrates the differences of
chemical profiles (Figure 4). Plant saps from P. domestica trees contained a high amount of
sorbitol. This sugar alcohol constituted about 58% of the plant sap
from P. domestica cv. Wavit but was not detected in samples from

coniferous trees (Figure 5). In contrast, pinitol was exclusively
found in plant sap from conifers. However, the most abundant
component was quinic acid in all conifer samples (Figure 5). The
relative abundance of quinic acid ranged from 30% in pine to 56%
in spruce. Sap samples of P. domestica were composed of 80%
sugars and sugar alcohols and 18% acids, whereas spruce, fir, pine,
and larch samples consisted of 29, 41, 50, and 36% sugars and
sugar alcohols and 69, 53, 43, and 61% acids, respectively. The composition of amino acids and other organic acids
differed significantly between the plant species (PERMANOVA,
df = 4, R’ = 46.85, N = 10000, P < 0.001). The dispersions
between the groups also differed significantly (PERMDISP, df = 4,
F = 3.96, N = 10000, P < 0.01), indicating that the separation
of the plant species could be effected by different variation
within species (Figure 6). The NMDS plot shows caffeic acid
and asparagine contributing to the separation of P. domestica
cv. Wavit from coniferous trees (Figure 6). Caffeic acid was
exclusively found in P. domestica cv. Wavit, while asparagine was
more abundant in P. domestica cv. Wavit as in P. abies and A. alba
(Figure 7). The main organic acid component in the plant sap of all tested
plant species was malic acid (29-48%). Aspartic acid was the
second most abundant component in all plants, except in larch
which contained more glutamic acid. Differences between the
plant species were detected concerning the relative amounts of
lysine in the plant sap composition. Lysine represented about
17% of the sap samples of spruce trees and was the third most
abundant component in those trees, as glutamic acid was in fir

in all samples. The NMDS plots indicate the responsibility of the

Electrical penetration graph recordings showed that C. pruni
emigrants and nymphs are able to feed on the plant saps of

spruce, pine, larch, and fir. EPGs recorded from Sth instar
nymphs prove that nymphs are not repelled by metabolites
of coniferous plants and able to reach the phloem and xylem
tissue with their stylet. The question arises why C. pruni
migrates to Prunus for reproduction when their progeny is
able to ingest food from conifers. We suggest that there is
no change in host acceptance of nymphs between different
instars, but nutritional needs could change between nymphal
development stages. Therefore we investigated the emergence of
adults starting from the earliest possible instar (2nd). Because
the impact of low food quality or inhibitory components may
accumulate and negative influence raise over time, 5th instar

optimal diet while early instars would suffer more from low food
quality than later ones. But it is of crucial importance, whether
C. pruni is able to fully develop from egg to adult stage on
coniferous trees. Bioassays revealed that adult psyllids survived
on coniferous trees, while nymphs did not develop and died,
although they were able to ingest plant sap from conifer needles. Thus, the chemical composition of the respective conifer saps
influences the nymphal survival and development. Therefore the
plant saps of overwintering hosts were subsequently analyzed
and compared to sap content of their reproduction host plant
(P. domestica). The GC-MS analysis revealed enormous differences in the
chemical compositions of plant sap of the Rosacea species
P. domestica cv. Wavit and the four studied conifer species. Especially the lack of sorbitol in all four conifers as well as
the high amount of quinic acid and pinitol (which was not
detected in Prunus trees) could be challenging for phloem feeding
insects, which alternate between Rosacea and conifers during
their life cycle. Even though it was known that spruce needles
contain quinic acid, shikimic acid, fructose, glucose, sucrose,
and pinitol (Schopf et al., 1982), to date it was unclear, in
which proportions they occur in the phloem and xylem sap of
coniferous trees, and how their proportions differ between tree
species. Until today it was a widespread belief that conifers are
used by migrating Cacopsylla species like C. pruni, C. picta,
and C. melanoneura for shelter during winter time, exclusively
(Burckhardt et al., 2014; Jarausch and Jarausch, 2016). In the

presented study we were able to show for the first time,
that conifers are not only shelter plants for migrating species
belonging to the genus Cacopsylla, but also an important food
resource enabling their overwintering. Thus, the term “shelter
plant” should hereafter be replaced by “overwintering host” or
just “alternate host” plant. Due to the lack of knowledge that psyllids feed on conifers,
the effect of coniferous phloem constituents like quinic acid,
shikimic acid, and pinitol on psyllid feeding behavior and
development was not studied before. Pinitol is a cyclic polyol,
which serves as osmoprotectant and is involved in a broad
spectrum of physiological processes in plants (Chiera et al.,
2006; Kordan et al., 2011; Saxena et al., 2013). It is found
in conifers, legumes (Fabaceae) and Caryophyllales such as
Simmondsia chinensis (Angyal and Macdonald, 1952; Dittrich
and Korak, 1984; Guo and Oosterhuis, 1995; Chiera et al.,
2006). D-pinitol induces oviposition of the Grass Yellow
Butterfly Eurema mandarina (Mukae et al., 2016). However,
an influence of pinitol from the phloem of alfalfa on phloem-
feeding pea aphid could not be found (Campbell and Binder,
1984),

There is evidence, that psyllid adults and nymphs are tolerant
to high osmotic pressures of their diets (Hall et al., 2010;
Russell and Pelz-Stelinski, 2015). Therefore, we hypothesize no
negative influence of pinitol on C. pruni, even if it occurs
in high amounts in overwintering hosts. Quite the contrary,
pinitol could act as mechanism of protection against freezing
stress, as shown for other polyols (Bale, 2002). The freezing
temperature of the green spruce aphid is reduced in the presence

of mannitol in aphid hemolymph (Parry, 1979). Whiteflies
accumulate sorbitol for thermo- and osmoprotection (Hendrix
and Salvucci, 1998). Somme (1965) found an accumulation of
sorbitol in overwintering eggs of European red mite (Panonychus
ulmi). We found that sorbitol is the most abundant component in
sap samples of P. domestica cv. Wavit, which is in accordance
with the fact that sorbitol is most often found in Rosacea
(Loescher, 1987). Sorbitol is also known to be accumulated
in the phloem of apple trees (Bieleski, 1969) and is the
most abundant soluble sugar in the phloem of pear and
apple fruits (Zhang et al., 2004, 2014). Nevertheless, adult
C. pruni can tolerate high amounts of sorbitol or pinitol in
their diet. EPG recordings suggest that C. pruni (both adults
and nymphs) also ingest xylem content (unpublished results),
which could be a regulatory reaction to reduce the phloem’s
high osmotic pressure by dilution. Pompon et al. (2011) showed
that aphids ingest more xylem sap after feeding on high
concentrated sucrose diets to compensate osmotic unbalance. Moreover, for nymphal development the availability of amino
acids (especially essential amino acids) could be of higher
importance, as nitrogen content of food is an important limiting
growth factor for phytophagous insects (Douglas, 2006). In
accordance with Douglas (1993) we found asparagine besides
aspartic acid and glutamic acid as one of the most abundant
amino acids in young leaves of Prunus, while we found only
low concentrations of glutamine in Prunus flush leaves. All
plant species contained only low concentrations of the essential
amino acids histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine,
phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. To compensate
for low quality of nitrogen in plant saps phloem feeders harbor
microsymbionts (Douglas, 2006). Many psyllid species harbor
the bacterial endosymbiont Carsonella ruddii, which provides
its host with essential amino acids (Thao et al., 2000). Also
representatives of the genus Wolbachia, Arsenophonus and
other Enterobacteriaceae were found in psyllids (Baumann,
2005). Although the microsymbionts harbored by C. pruni are
unidentified, differences in the symbiont community in adults

and nymphs were not expected, because vertical transmission of
endosymbionts was shown for many species. Furthermore, recent
studies indicated the transovarial transmission of Arsenophonus
in Cacopsylla pyricola (Cooper et al., 2017). We suggest that the inability of C. pruni nymphs to
develop on coniferous trees is due to differences in organic
acid availability. The caffeic acid, which is exclusively found
in cv. Wavit, could play a key role in host acceptance of
C. pruni and maybe act as a phagostimulant. Caffeic acid
was found in several stone fruits like peaches and plums,
which are typical host plants of C. pruni (Carbonaro et al.,
2002; Lombardi-Boccia et al., 2004). However, not all of the
components responsible for the separation of cv. Wavit from
the coniferous species need to be of biological relevance. To
unravel which components are actually important for proper
development or which ones may inhibit nymphal growth,
feeding experiments with nymphs on artificial diets are crucial. The analysis of excreted honeydew could suggest important
information on how psyllids process plant nutrients. This
study also revealed differences between the plant saps of the
investigated coniferous trees. Therefore, a detailed analysis of
EPG recordings from nymphs on the different tree species
could be needful to identify feeding stimulants or deterrents
and will be investigated in future. This knowledge could be
used for development of an artificial diet system for rearing
of C. pruni and screening for potential toxins against psyllids
(jancovich et al., 1997; Hall et al., 2010). Interestingly, although
some of the migrating psyllids like C. pruni harbor phloem-
limited plant pathogenic bacteria (‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ or ‘Ca. Liberibacter’) and feed on conifers, the phytopathogens seem to
be restricted to vector insects and their reproduction host plants
(Gross, 2016). Because the genomes of Phytoplasma spp. lack
metabolic genes but contain a lot of transporter systems, it is
suggested that they depend strongly on the nutrition of their
hosts (Oshima et al., 2004; Kube et al., 2008). Insight on the
chemical composition of the phloem sap of host plants could
support developing a culture media for phytoplasmas and may
advance the research on phytoplasma diseases (Trivedi et al.,
2016). REFERENCES

CONCLUSION

No mechanical nor chemical border prevents C. pruni adults and
nymphs from feeding on conifers. Emigrants feed and survive
on their overwintering hosts. Nymphs can feed on, but are not
able to develop on spruce and fir. This is likely due to strong
differences in the compositions of organic acids and sugars
between plant saps of conifers and P. domestica. Furthermore,
feeding experiments with nymphs on artificial diets should reveal
which components are responsible for successful development of
C. pruni. Additionally, more insight on phloem sap composition
could open up new possibilities for phytoplasma cultivation and
pathogen research. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS
