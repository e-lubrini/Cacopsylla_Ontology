Abstract

A revised checklist to the species of Psylloidea (Hemiptera) from California is presented, with information on host plant
data, distributions, introduced and pest species, parasites, parasitoids, and predators, and biological control programs. The
list includes 164 species, of which six are newly recorded. In total, this comprises a 26% increase in the number of species
recorded for California since the last published checklist in 1988. Choricymoza Bliven is a new synonym of Phylloplecta
Riley, and 10 species previously in Euphalerus Schwarz are recombined under Nyctiphalerus Bliven. California has the
richest native psyllid fauna in North America, and the influence of climatic and floristic diversity on this diversification
is considered. Key words

From a review of the literature and examination of specimens at the California State Collection of Arthropods
(CSCA), the California Academy of Sciences (CAL), the Essig Museum of Entomology (EMEC), and the Bohart
Museum of Entomology (UCDC) (all institutions in California, USA), we present an updated checklist of the psyl-
lids (Psylloidea, Hemiptera) of California. The checklist updates the published records for California and includes
all of the new records of species and host plants for California post-1988 (the date of the last published checklist,
Hodkinson 1988). Synonymies are not provided, these can be found in prior publications (e.g., Hodkinson 1986,
1988; Hodkinson & Bird 2000; Hodkinson & Hollis 1987; Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997; Ouvrard 2010; and refer-
ences therein). This treatment includes 164 psyllid species for California (121 of these were included in Hodkinson 1988, 37
of these have been published since 1988, and 6 of these are previously unpublished records). These 164 species
records represent an increase of 26% since 1988 (Hodkinson 1988). The increase of 43 additional species for Cali-
fornia is due in large part to the addition of 16 introduced species since 1988. Table 1 provides a summary of Cali-
fornian psyllid genera, species numbers, and host plant genera associations. Several native Californian psyllid genera require further revisionary work, in particular Neophyllura Loginova,
which has numerous colour and wing pattern variations. A more in depth look at the Californian Calinda
Blanchard species would help to determine the range of variation and distribution in these species, and the genus
Calophya Léw needs additional investigation as there are undescribed species and notable polymorphism in some
specimen series. Further, undescribed Calophya species from southern California appear to be related to species
described from Mexico (more information on this potentially under-explored biogeographic link is given below). Aphalaroida Crawford was revised by Hodkinson (1991a), and in his revision, four Aphalaroida species previously
recorded for California were considered to be restricted to other US states; material in Californian collections needs
to be reviewed, particularly the specimens now collectively placed under the widespread species, A. pithecolobia
Crawford. Several other genera are taxonomically complex and/or require additional systematic work, these
include Aphalara, Bactericera, Cacopsylla, and Craspedolepta. Accepted by L. Mound: 02 Dec. 2011; published: 15 Feb. 2012 1

PERCY ET AL. We found several specimen records in Californian collections that are unconfirmed and require further study to
confirm their presence in California; these include Calophya nigripennis Riley (EMEC), Aphalara persicaria
Caldwell and Aphalara manitobaensis Caldwell (CSCA), Cacopsylla hamata (Tuthill) (EMEC), Cacopsylla rara
(Tuthill) (CSCA), and Leuronota maculata (Crawford) (CSCA). Two species currently only determined to genus
are also known from California. An Acizzia species close to Acizzia jucunda (Tuthill) has been found on several
Acacia spp. in California; first recorded in California in 1992 (Gill 1992), this species was informally assigned to
species #22 by Australian entomologist Keith Taylor. In addition, because the North America material assigned to
Aphalara calthae (Linnaeus, 1761) is not conspecific with this European species (Hodkinson 1988; Daniel Burck-
hardt pers. comm. ), we have not included A. calthae in our checklist, and further work on the North American
Polygonum-feeding Aphalara will be required to determine the number of Californian species. This checklist project was initiated in 2010 in response to the discovery in 2008 of Diaphorina citri
Kuwayama, the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), in California (Anon. 2010). This invasive psyllid pest poses a serious
threat to the Californian citrus industry primarily due to the transmission of Candidatus Liberibacter spp., a bacte-
rium responsible for citrus greening (Huanglongbing) disease (Grafton-Cardwell et al. 2006; Grafton-Cardwell
2010). In order to aid in the selection of psyllid species for host range testing of potential biological control agents,
we completed this review of the psyllid fauna of California. Given the concerns raised by ACP, as well as other
psyllid pests in California, we also provide information on the known parasites, parasitoids, and predators of psyl-
lids, some of which are effective biological control agents (e.g., Dahlsten et al. 1998). Much of the work surveying
the parasites of native Californian psyllids was undertaken by Dilworth Jensen (1910-1973) (Essig Museum of
Entomology, University of California, Berkeley). Jensen (1951, 1957a) undertook a survey of psyllid parasites over
a number of years, often rearing parasitoids from field collected psyllid nymphs. The majority of parasites known
from psyllids belong to nine hymenopteran species of parasitoid from six families. Parasitoid larvae develop in the
3.5" instar nymphs of psyllids, but it is not always possible to identify the host psyllid species from parasitized
nymphs alone. Future developments using DNA methods for analyzing the gut contents of arthropods may assist in
identifying both the host plant diet, and the diet of biocontrol agents (e.g., Agusti ef al. 2003; Jurado-Rivera et al. 2009). The most promising biocontrol agent for ACP, which is currently undergoing host specificity testing and
review at the University of California, Riverside, is the solitary ectoparasitoid, Tamarixia radiata (Waterston)
(Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) (Hoddle 2010). Ongoing biological control agent testing for host specificity of this
parasitoid includes native Californian psyllid species that occur in and around citrus growing areas (e.g., native
psyllids on common native plants in wilderness areas around citrus orchards in the Central Valley, including Het-
eropsylla and Ceanothia species); and native Californian psyllid genera that are most closely related phylogeneti-
cally to ACP (with Neophyllura being the closest of these, followed by Diclidophlebia and, more distantly,
Calophya). Summary of information on psyllid parasites and parasitoids

In 1957, Jensen published the first review of California psyllid parasitoids covering Hymenoptera and Diptera
(Jensen 1957a). In California, Jensen reared parasitoids from more than 30 psyllid species in 11 genera. The major-
ity of psyllid parasitoids attack the immature, nymphal stages, although a few cases are known of adult parasitism,
such as the gall midge genus Endopsylla. Lal (1934) studied the biology of an Endospylla species in Scotland (UK)
and determined that females lay eggs on the fore wings of the adult psyllid. These eggs hatch in 8 to 13 days, and
larvae feed initially for 3 or 4 days as ectoparasites, and then burrow into the haemocoel of the host to complete
development. In addition to hymenopteran and dipteran parasitoids, adult psyllids can frequently be found with
mites (Acariformes) attached. No hymenopteran parasitoids are known to attack adult psyllids, and the majority are
ectoparasitoids of nymphs. A notable exception is the eulophid parasitoid, T. radiata, which is an ectoparasitoid
and feeds on hemolymph from the point of attachment underneath ACP nymphs. In addition, adult female T. radi-
ata can kill ACP nymphs via host feeding. To host feed, female parasitoids damage psyllid nymphs with the ovi-
positor and imbibe hemolymph that issues from the wound. The trauma of host feeding is often sufficient to kill
nymphs. A number of native Californian psyllids are known to have multiple parasitoids. For example, Neophyllura
arbuti (Schwarz), Trioza beameri Tuthill and Pexopsylla cercocarpi Jensen are each known to host three different

species of parasitoid from three genera in three different families; and Ceanothia ceanothi (Crawford) is parasitized
by four species of parasitoid in four different genera in three families. Some parasitoids of psyllids, such as the
encyrtid genus Prionomitus, appear to be parasitic principally on psyllids, and Prionomitus mitratus (Dalman) is
recorded from at least 13 psyllid species in four genera, all of which have host plants in the Rosales, including
Ceanothus, Cercocarpus, Salix, Rhamnus, and Alnus. Another encyrtid genus, Psyllaephagus, primarily parasitizes
psyllids and has been used in the biocontrol of the pistachio psyllid (Agonoscena pistaciae Burckhardt & Lauterer)
(Mehrnejad & Copland 2006), the blue gum psyllid (Ctenarytaina eucalypti (Maskell)) (Dahlsten er al. 1998), and
the red gum lerp psyllid (Glycaspis brimblecombei Moore) (Daane et al. 2005). At least 10 Psyllaephagus species
were reared from native Californian psyllids by Jensen (1957a), including several undescribed species of Psyl-
laephagus from seven different psyllid genera. At least eight species of Tamarixia are known to parasitize more
than 20 species of psyllid. The impact that invasive psyllids, such as D. citri, have on native California psyllids is
unknown, neither is it known whether any native parasitoids could be sufficiently generalist to exploit a new
resource in the form of introduced psyllid species. Summary of psyllid-host plant biogeography and co-diversification

North American psyllid species fall primarily into three major faunistic groups with different biogeographic affini-
ties (Hodkinson 1988). First, there are a number of genera with holarctic distributions (with most of these also rep-
resented in California, e.g., Aphalara, Bactericera, Cacopsylla, Craspedolepta, Livia, Psylla, and at least two
monophyletic species groups of the currently polyphyletic genus Trioza), including a number of species that are
widespread and occur on a single host plant species or several closely related host plants across wide pan-arctic dis-
tributions (e.g., Bactericera salicivora found on Salix in Asia, Europe and North America, including California). Second, there are genera that are primarily from tropical Central and South America, with some species distribu-
tions extending into southern and eastern USA (these are not represented in California, with the possible exception
of some triozid lineages). Third, there is an element of the fauna that is endemic to North America (14 genera are
endemic to North America, and at least seven of these are represented in the Californian fauna, including: Cean-
othia, Euglyptoneura, Neophyllura, Neotriozella, Nyctiphalerus, Pexopsylla, Purshivora). This element is the larg-
est faunistic component, with 67% of North American species endemic to the region. There is also an element that
is particularly important in California: the genera are often tropical or South American in origin (e.g., Aphalaroida,
Calinda, Freysuila, Heteropsylla) but there are Californian members that are adapted to arid regions and therefore
able to adjust to California’s highly variable winter rainfall. In addition, numerous psyllid introductions from Aus-
tralasia (e.g., Acizzia, and five Eucalyptus-feeding taxa) share a similar arid-adapted ecology. At present, there are
17 arid-adapted species recorded from both Mexico and California, but we expect that more extensive sampling in
southern California would increase the number of species and genera sharing this biogeographic association. California has the largest part of the endemic North America psyllid fauna with 57% of endemic North Ameri-
can psyllid genera, and 38% of endemic North American psyllid species, represented in California, and 31% of
these species are found only in California. Several genera, such as Ceanothia, Nyctiphalerus, and possibly Euglyp-
toneura, appear to have a centre of endemism in California. California has the richest floristic diversity in North
America (Calsbeek et al. 2003), and studies have shown that herbivorous insect diversity is directly correlated with
plant species diversity (e.g., Novotny et al. 2006); it is therefore not surprising that California has the highest diver-
sity of psyllid species in North America. The unique endemic diversity of psyllids in California compared to the
rest of North America, with a sharp drop in endemicity even in neighbouring western states (e.g., Arizona [east of
California] and Oregon [north]), is due to both the geographic and topological diversity of California, and the rich-
ness of the Mediterranean-type plant biota of the Californian Floristic Province. Psyllids are found on a number of
characteristic, species rich Californian plant groups (e.g., Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus, Cercocarpus, and Salix)
(Table 1). The best examples of regional co-diversification among psyllid and host plant groups are with the genera
Ceanothus and Salix. In particular, Ceanothus, with around 55 species (~45 species in California) and a centre of
diversity and endemism in California (Hardig et al. 2000), has been colonized multiple times by psyllid lineages
and is host to three psyllid genera and 15 psyllid species. 4 - Zootaxa 3193 © 2012 Magnolia Press PERCY ET AL. Hodkinson (2009) pointed out that psyllid species occurring in strongly seasonal Mediterranean-type climates
have compressed periods of reproduction and development. In particular, variability of rainfall and temperature can
influence the evolutionary development of periodicity; and temperature and precipitation gradients are signifi-
cantly correlated with regional diversity in the Californian flora (Ackerly 2009). High psyllid species diversity is
found in Mediterranean-type climatic zones around the world. The temporally compressed periods of psyllid devel-
opment in these regions may be promoting both host specificity and speciation because of the need to synchronize
with the host plant resource within a short period of time (e.g., plant growth flush), thus potentially promoting an
increased likelihood of reproductive asynchronicity and isolation between psyllid species on different host species. This effect may be particularly important in promoting psyllid diversity in California, where short developmental
periods may be even less likely to overlap given the diverse array of topologically complex microclimates. Another factor contributing to high psyllid diversity in Mediterranean-type climatic zones is the spatial distri-
bution of host plants. Studies have shown that psyllids are able to better track the spatial and temporal availability
of their host plants when dispersion within and among host plant populations is facilitated by a relatively high den-
sity of host plant individuals (Hodkinson 2009), and there is likely a critical population density threshold of host
individuals needed to sustain a host specific psyllid lineage through time (Percy er al. 2004). The combination of
high plant species richness with relatively high localized density of individuals for a given host plant in Mediterra-
nean-type zones may make these environments likely to promote species diversity in psyllids. In comparison,
although tropical forests have higher overall plant species diversity, they are also characterized by greater spatial
distance between individuals of a given plant species, creating a highly heterogeneous plant community. Con-
versely, at the other end of the spectrum, in northern temperate and boreal regions, there is poor plant species rich-
ness but host plant species are often widely distributed with very large effective population sizes. Californian and
other Mediterranean, and similarly highly seasonal biomes may therefore present a favourable combination of
environmental factors: relatively high plant species richness coupled with relatively high levels of homogeneous
patchiness in the structure of plant populations, which together promote both psyllid species diversification and
persistence of highly adapted and host specific psyllid lineages through time. There are 30 species that are considered introduced to California in this treatment. The pest psyllid species in
California include both native North American species, for instance Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc), a major pest of
tomatoes native to the USA that has been repeatedly introduced or invaded California from other states (Hansen et
al. 2008); Pachypsylla celtidismamma (Fletcher), and P. celtidisvesiculum Riley, are minor pests of Celtis, native to
eastern and central USA and considered introduced in California), as well as species introduced from Asia (e.g.,
Cacopsylla fatsiae (Jensen), Diaphorina citri), Australia (e.g., Acizzia uncatoides (Ferris and Klyver), Glycaspis
brimblecombei), Europe (e.g., Psyllopsis fraxinicola (Foerster), Trioza alacris Flor), and South America (e.g.,
Calophya schini Tuthill, Platycorypha nigrivirga Burckhardt), which have continued to be associated with their
original host plants after introduction into California. Many psyllid pest species are multivoltine (e.g., Bactericera
cockerelli and Cacopsylla fatsiae) and may be broader in their dietary tolerance than native species. For instance,
host preferences of introduced species may expand in regions of introduction relative to the host preference in the
native range (e.g., the eugenia psyllid, Trioza eugeniae Froggatt, which in its native range feeds on Syzygium host
species, has expanded its host range to include another introduced myrtaceous genus, Metrosideros, in California;
the olive psyllid, Euphyllura olivina (Costa), is on Olea spp. in its native range, but alternate hosts in California
may include Elaeagnus angustifolia, and Phillyrea latifolia; and Acizzia hakeae is recorded on Hakea (although the
native host plant preferences are not well known), but in California it is recorded from Hakea and Grevillea, both
Proteaceae). California faces a number of challenges with introduced psyllid species, some of which have been effectively
controlled with biological control programs (e.g., Dahlsten et al. 1998). There are also a number of taxonomic
complexities and interesting biogeographic patterns, as well as undescribed species diversity in the native Califor-
nia fauna, which remain to be explored. Consequently, to emphasise these issues and to assist with the primary
objective of better understanding the California psyllid fauna in light of the D. citri invasion, this checklist has been
compiled to aid in directing and guiding research efforts in these areas. CHECKLIST OF THE PSYLLIDS OF CALIFORNIA Zootaxa 3193 © 2012 Magnolia Press - 5

first collected in New Zealand, as “apparently introduced from Australia” and mentions that "Keith L. Taylor of the
Division of Entomology [CSIRO], Australia, has taken a closely related species from Hakea dactyloides in New
South Wales.” The Californian introduction may therefore have originated from either Australia or New Zealand. uncatoides (Ferris and Klyver, 1932)

Type locality: New Zealand (but not native there). Additional distribution: Native in Australia; introduced in Chile, Colombia, Europe, Guadeloupe, Mexico, USA. Host plant: Acacia and Albizia species, (Jensen 1957b; Munro 1965; Burckhardt 1989). Remarks: First recorded in California in 1954 (Jensen 1957b; Beardsley et al. 1995). Predators: Diomus pumilio (Weise) (black lady beetle, Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Anthocoris nemoralis

(Hodkinson 1988) and A. spinifera Crawford under this species; A. pithecolobia is therefore now considered to be a
widespread species in California. Parasitoids: Psyllaephagus sp. rauca Hodkinson, 1991

Type locality: USA, California. Additional distribution: USA, Arizona, New Mexico; Mexico. Host plant: Prosopis juliflora, P. glandulosa. Arytaina Foerster
genistae (Latreille, 1804)
Type locality: Europe. Additional distribution: introduced in USA, California, Oregon, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Washington;
Canada, Nova Scotia. Host plant: Cytisus scoparius. Remarks: First recorded in North America in the early 1900s, and first recorded in California in 1993 (Wheeler &
Hoebeke 2004). Although an accidental introduction, the combination of this species together with another
introduced psyllid, Arytainilla spartiophila, may help to control the host plant, which is considered a noxious
weed. Arytainilla Loginova
spartiophila (Foerster, 1848)
Type locality: Europe. Additional distribution: Introduced in Australia, New Zealand, and North America; USA, California, Oregon,
Virginia, Washington; Canada, British Columbia. Host plant: Cytisus scoparius. Remarks: Although deliberately introduced as a biocontrol agent for Cytisus scoparius in Australia and New
Zealand, it is an accidental introduction in North America (Wheeler & Hoebeke 2004). Early collections in
California are from the 1970s (CSCA); common name: broom psyllid. CHECKLIST OF THE PSYLLIDS OF CALIFORNIA Zootaxa 3193 © 2012 Magnolia Press - 7

eulophid parasitoid, Tamarixia schina Zuparko, native to Chile, which may provide satisfactory control (Paine &
Dreistadt 2007; Zuparko et al. 2011), but the effectiveness of this natural enemy to control the peppertree psyllid
may be limited by high seasonal variation in psyllid populations (Hagan & Tassan 1996). 12 + Zootaxa 3193 © 2012 Magnolia Press PERCY ET AL. triozomima Schwarz, 1904

Type locality: Taiwan. Additional distribution: Broadly distributed in Asia and India. Introduced in Arabian Peninsula, South and Central
America, and USA. Host plant: Several Citrus spp., Bergera (Murraya) koenigii, Murraya exotica. Remarks: Studied as a citrus pest since the 1920s in its native range in India and Pakistan (Husain & Nath 1927;
Atwal 1962; Atwal et al. 1970). First detected in USA (Florida) in 1998 (Halbert & Manjunath 2004), and detected
in southern California in 2008; common name: Asian citrus psyllid (ACP). This species transmits Candidatus
Liberibacter spp., a bacterium responsible for citrus greening (Huanglongbing) disease that may result in
considerable economic damage to citrus industries. Parasitoids: Tamarixia radiata, and Diaphorencyrtus aligarhensis (Shafee, Alam & Agarwal). The eulophid
parasitoid, T. radiata, controls the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) effectively in India (Atwal 1962), and it is considered
a superior biological control to the encyrtid parasitoid, D. aligarhensis, in Florida where both have been tested for
the control of ACP. T. radiata exhibits high parasitization rates and rapid establishment in new areas (Aubert 1987;
Skelly & Hoy 2004) and has now been introduced to many parts of the world (Halbert & Manjunath 2004; Halbert
& Nujiez 2004; Wenninger & Hall 2007). Diclidophlebia Crawford

Type locality: Australia. Additional distribution: Introduced in New Zealand, USA. Host plant: Eucalyptus citriodora, E. maculata. Remarks: First recorded in California in 2000 (Gill 2000). This psyllid has three generations per year in its native
Australian range. Populations in California tend to reach peak levels in spring and fall, but high summer
temperatures appear to limit psyllid numbers for this species (Paine & Dreistadt 2007); common name: spotted

Type locality: Europe. Additional distribution: Western Mediterranean, including North Africa. Introduced in USA. Host plant: Olea spp., but alternate hosts in California may include Elaeagnus angustifolia, and Phillyrea latifolia
(UC Riverside, CISR). Remarks: This species is a pest of olive trees in its native range in the Mediterranean and North Africa, and was
first recorded in California in 2007 (Gill & Watson 2007). The olive psyllid aestivates during the hottest summer
months resuming feeding activity after the first autumn rains. There are usually three generations per year; the
second generation, around May, is associated with the flowering shoots and flower buds and may cause many
flowers to abort. Large populations may retard growth of young trees. (Hodkinson 1986; Burckhardt 1989;
Ksantini er al. 2002); common name: olive psyllid. Parasitoids and Predators: Apocharips eleaphila (Silvestri), probably as a hyperparasitoid, and Psyllaephagus
euphyllurae (Masi). These cynipoid and encyrtid parasitoids were recorded parasitizing olive psyllid in Europe in
1951 and 1911. Other potential predators of E. olivina are Chrysoperla rufilabris (Burmeister) (lacewing,
Neuroptera) and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant (coccinellid beetle, Coleoptera) (UC Riverside, CISR). Freysuila Aleman

brimblecombei Moore, 1964
Type locality: Australia. Additional distribution: Introduced in Europe, South America, and USA (Valente & Hodkinson 2009). Host plant: Several Eucalyptus spp., including E. camaldulensis, E. globulus, E. nitens, E. blakelyi, E. brassiana,
E. bridgesiana, E. camphora, E. dealbata, E. diversicolor, E. sideroxylon, E. nicholii, E. lehmannii, E. rudis, E.
tereticornis, E. mannifera, E. maculosa. Remarks: First recorded in California in June 1998 (Gill 1998). This pest is a major threat to susceptible
Eucalyptus species (in particular E. camaldulensis, E. rudis, E. tereticornis which can experience heavy
defoliation) that are grown in urban landscapes, as wind shelters, or as commercial forest species (Brennan et al. 1999; Brennan et al. 2001a); common name: red gum lerp psyllid. Parasitoids and Predators: Psyllaephagus bliteus Riek (Daane et al. 2005; Dahlsten et al. 2005) released in
California as a biocontrol in 2000. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that P. bliteus can lay eggs in psyllid
nymphs of any age, but female parasitoids prefer third and fourth instars (UC Riverside, CISR; UC Berkeley,
CBC). In some cases, generalist predators (e.g., Anthocoris nemoralis, Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) may interfere
with the effectiveness of P. bliteus to control psyllid populations (Erbilgin et al. 2004). At least four coccinellid
beetles (Coleoptera) and lacewings (Neuroptera) have been recorded feeding on this psyllid (Erbilgin et al. 2004). CHECKLIST OF THE PSYLLIDS OF CALIFORNIA Zootaxa 3193 © 2012 Magnolia Press - 17

sculptoconus Crawford, 1914
Type locality: USA, California. Host plant: Unknown. Nyctiphalerus Bliven
Hollis and Martin (1997) in their review of the genus Euphalerus Schwarz pointed out that the group of North
American species placed in Euphalerus sensu lato and associated with Ceanothus and Cerocarpus host plants was
not congeneric with the type species Euphalerus nidifex Schwarz; and Hodkinson (1988) commented on the
absence of characters to differentiate Nyctiphalerus lynceus Bliven from this group. The E. nidifex group is
considered to be in the Euphalerinae and the species here transferred to Nyctiphalerus are in the Arytaininae (Hollis
& Martin 1997; Daniel Burckhardt pers. comm.). From examination of the type material (CAL) we can confirm
that Bliven’s original designation of Nyctiphalerus as a monotypic genus was superficial, and he may not have
examined other congeneric taxa (even within California). In addition, some doubt surrounds the validation of
Bliven’s names as he published them privately with limited distribution. Since the genus name has subsequently
been used in publications, we are taking advantage of the availability of this genus to transfer, from Euphalerus to
Nyctiphalerus, all of the North American species that are clearly congeneric with N. Lynceus, including two species
not present in California, Nyctiphalerus dubius (Caldwell) comb.n. and Nyctiphalerus idahoensis (Jensen)

Lynceus Bliven, 1955

Type locality: USA, California

Host plant: Unknown. Remarks: Bliven (1955) described this species in a monotypic genus, but it clearly belongs
with other North American species previously in Euphalerus feeding on Ceanothus and Cercocarpus; both D.D. Jensen (in collection annotations, EMEC) and Hodkinson (1988) suggested Nyctiphalerus should be synonomized
with this group. Bliven’s specimens examined (CAL) of this species look close to Euphalerus vermiculosus. Bliven
collected specimens from Sequoia sempervirens, but this is unlikely to be the host. nepos (Bliven, 1956) comb.n. Euphalerus nepos Bliven, 1956: 21

Choricymoza Bliven, 1955. Type species Choricymoza sequoiae Bliven, 1955 syn.n. Burckhardt and Lauterer (1997) suggested a congeneric status for Choricymoza and Phylloplecta based on the
close similarity of Choricymoza sequoiae to Phylloplecta rubicola (Tuthill, 1943) according to Bliven’s original
descriptions of the former. From examination of the type material (CAL) we can confirm the superficial
designation of this species as a monotypic genus, and as with Nyctiphalerus above, it seems that Bliven may not
have examined related Californian species. occidentalis (Tuthill, 1939)

Type locality: USA, California; Canada, British Columbia. Additional distribution: USA, Washington. Host plant: Rubus parviflorus (Hodkinson 1988; Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997). sequoiae (Bliven, 1955) comb.n. Choricymoza sequoiae Bliven, 1955: 12

Type locality: USA, California. Host plant: Likely to be Rubus sp. Remarks: Remarks: Burckhardt and Lauterer (1997) posited that this species may be conspecific with Phylloplecta
rubicola (recorded from Washington). Further examination and comparison of the type specimens is needed to
confirm this. There is also a close resemblance to P. occidentalis. Platycorypha Tuthill

Type locality: Australia. Additional distribution: Introduced in USA. Host plant: Syzygium paniculatum, Syzygium smithii, and Metrosideros excelsus in California. Remarks: First recorded in California in May 1988. Psyllid damage can severely disfigure trees, which are
commonly used in ornamental plantings. In cooler areas of the California coast, such as the city of San Francisco,
the parasitoid populations do not increase quickly enough to respond to sudden increases in psyllid numbers
(Dahlsten et al. 1995, 2000). This psyllid is sensitive to both frost and heat, and temperatures above 90°F are
known to inhibit population growth; common name: lillypilly psyllid, or eugenia psyllid. Parasitoids: Tamarixia dahlsteni Zuparko. Some native natural enemies have been noted on the eugenia psyllid in
California, but their effects on psyllid populations have been negligible (UC Berkeley, CBC). frontalis Crawford, 1910
