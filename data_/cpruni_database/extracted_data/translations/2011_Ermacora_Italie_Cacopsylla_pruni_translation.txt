Abstract

A two year surveys was conducted in Bul VERSZia iia WRION (HOHSASIEM aly) withthe aims to improve knowledge about

biological characteristics of Cacopsylla pruni Scopoli, and to ascertain its role in the spread of different ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum’ strains, Insects were captured starting from March till the end of April in apricot orchards with high European stone
fruit yellows incidence. For phytoplasma detection a nested PCR protocol based on aceF gene was adopted. Results confirmed
that the percentage of phytoplasma positive insects increased from March to April, because they fed on infected trees. During the
reimmigration season the percentage of females was higher than that of males, especially after coupling time. Besides a very high
percentage of infected C. pruni, no significant differences related to the sex were observed. ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ strains of aceF-A,
aceF-C and aceF-E subgroups, were mainly found in the captured C. pruni population. Key words: aceF gene, nested PCR, European stone fruit yellows. Introduction

Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli) is the vector of ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma prunorum’, associated with European
stone fruit yellows (ESFY) disease (Carraro et al.,
1998). C. pruni is a univoltine psyllid widespread in
Europe. In spring eggs of C. pruni are laid by reimmi-
grant adults on Prunus spp. ; individuals of new genera-
tion develop on Prunus spp. and new adults abandon the
original host in summer to overwinter on conifers (Thé-
baud et al., 2009). In Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) re-
gion, north-eastern Italy, several Prunus species were
reported as natural host of ESFY (Carraro et al., 2002)
and different strains of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ with different
virulence were observed (Ermacora et al., 2010). Re-
cently, in order to investigate phytoplasma strains vari-
ability, molecular tools for ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ detection
and characterization were developed (Danet et a/., 2008,
Martini et al., 2010). Although in our conditions C.
pruni population density usually does not cause direct
damages to the crops their ability to transmit ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ requires a correct orchard management in
order to prevent the spread of ESFY. With the aim to
monitor the presence of C. pruni and evaluate their in-
fectivity for a correct integrated pest management, an
extensive survey was conducted during 2010 and 2011
in an area with high ESFY disease pressure. Another
aim of this research was to acquire more knowledge
about the biology of C. pruni. Materials and methods

During 2010 and 2011, from March till the end of April,
a total of 383 individuals of reimmigrant C. pruni were
collected in apricot orchards located in areas with high
ESFY disease pressure. In the monitored orchards

ESFY incidence was very high (about 90% of PCR
positive plants) and management program was insecti-
cide free in order to avoid interferences with the natural
dynamic of C. pruni population. Insects were captured
by the beating method, and immediately stored in 80%
ethanol. C. pruni were individually observed under ste-
reomicroscope for proper identification and sex charac-
terization. Nucleic acids were extracted from the insects
according the protocol proposed by Doyle and Doyle
(1990) with slight modifications. Protocol adopted for ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ detection in
the samples was based on aceF gene, with a direct PCR
with primers AceFfl/AceFrl followed by nested-PCR
with primers pair AceFf2/AceFr2 (Danet et al., 2008). RFLP of nested-PCR amplicons using endonucleases
Bpil, Haelll and TspS091 was adopted for characteriza-
tion of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ strains (Martini et a/., 2010). Results

During the two considered years, presence of reimmi-
grant C. pruni was detected from March 22 till the end
of April, with a peak of population in the period 12-16
April. Mating period lasting from the beginning till the
20" of April. Male and female percentages varied in the
considered period with a substantial reduction of male
presence. Percentage of insects that hosted ‘Ca. P. prun-
orum’ increased during their presence on apricots with-
out significant differences between males and females. Considering the characterization of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’
strains present in the insect analysed population, a clear
prevalence of strains of aceF-A, aceF-C and aceF-E
subgroups was reported, aceF-B strains were rare and
aceF-D strains were not detected; in 19% of the cases
we found mixed infections. Insect vectors of phytoplasmas and phytoplasma-vector interaction II

in C. pruni based on aceF gene. Discussion

This survey confirmed the presence of C. pruni and its
high infectivity in the FVG region, where ESFY disease
is endemic and affects wild and cultivated Prunus. As
reported by Carraro et al. (2004) it was confirmed that
overwintering adults infectivity increase after their re-
immigration on infected Prunus spp.. In our case the
infection rate of the first capture reimmigrants was
56.4% and reached a plateau slightly exceeding 80% in
the last two captures. Results obtained on the
male/female percentages when the reimmigrant indi-
viduals are present in the orchards, evidenced the lon-
gevity of females that at the end of the monitored period
represented 88.5% of the population. The longevity of
females could be explained from an evolutionary point
of view considering the crucial role of the females for
the species survival. Another hypothesis to explain the
variability of the male presence during the monitoring
period and the changes in their mean infectivity could
be a mortality of the males after the copulation. Con-
cerning ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ molecular characterization,
the obtained results indicated mainly the presence of
strains of AceF-A,-C, and -E subgroups and a sporadic

presence of AceF-B strains. Mixed infections were also
detected and explained with the presence of the same
strains in plants of Prunus spp. in the same area. Acknowledgements
