The same phytoplasmas were identified also in Philaenus spumarius samples collected in yellow sticky traps located inside the plum orchards . ‚ Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum™ was detected in one declining cherry plant and in samples of Fieberiella florii. Among the insect species tested for phytoplasma presence Cacopsylla pruni was only captured once, and the sample resulted negative to the molecular tests. Key words: Cherry decline, PCR/RFLP analyses, insects, epidemiology. Introduction Vignola is one of the most important plum and cherry growingareasin n orthernItaly. Fromthe early thirties a disease called ﬁ leptonecrosis ﬂ affecting plum, cherry and apricot (Goidanich, 1933; 1934) was reported in the area. This disease now named European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) is associated with ‚ Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum™ (Seemüller and Schneider, 2004). Severe outbreaks were observed over the years, mainly after Japanese plum varieties were introduced into the area. Recently, two experimental plum orchards where tolerance/resistance to ESFY phytoplasma is studied were monitored. Surveys were extended to verify phytoplasma presence also in ch erry plants growing nearby. Symptomatic cherry plants, abou t 10 year™s old, showed poor vegetation, reduced leaf size, upward curled leaves with discolorations ranging from yellow to red. Insects collected on yellow sticky traps located in the experimental plum orchards were also tested in order to verify phytoplasma presence in the environment. Materials and methods Leaf and small branch samples were collected from six cherry plants (3 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic) near the experimental plum fields. A total of 12 samples were employed for nucleic acid extraction using a chloroform/phenol method (Prince et al ., 1993). During 2005-2006 insect mo nitoring was carried out from March to the end of July with yellow sticky traps randomly distributed in the two experimental plum orchards. Insects collected from traps were maintained in alcohol 100%at 4°C for classification; nucleic acid extraction from interesting species was then carried out with a rapid CTAB-based procedure (Angelini et al ., 2001) on batches of 3 insects per species. Direct PCR with P1/P7 primer pair (Deng and Hiruki, 1991; Schneider et al. , 1995) and nested amplification with primers R16F2/R2 and/or R16(X)F1/R1 (Lee et al ., 1995) were performed on both plant and insect samples following a described protocol (Schaff et al., 1992). Reference phytoplasma strains were employed as positive controls. Amplicons ob tained with R16F2/R2 and R16(X)F1/R1 primer pairs were subjected to RFLP analyses with Tru I, Rsa I and Ssp I restriction enzymes to verify phytoplasma identity. Results and discussion Only samples from both phloem and leaf midribs of symptomatic cherry plants gave positive results in nested PCR amplifications. RFLP analyses indicate the presence of ‚ Ca. P. prunorum™ in one of the trees and of phytoplasmas belonging to ribosomal subgroup 16SrIIIA in the other two symptomatic cherry plants (figure 1). Several potentially phytoplasma vectors were captured in yellow sticky traps (table 1). Cacopsylla pruni Scopoli, vector of ‚ Ca . P. prunorum™ (Carraro et al ., 1998) was only captured once and was negative to molecular tests. Nested PCR amplification detected phytoplasma presence in 4 out of the 6 species tested. RFLP analyses with Tru I showed restriction profiles of phytoplasmas related to ribosomal group 16SrV (Elm yellows) in Anoplotettix spp. and Metcalfa pruinosa Say. Ribosomal group 16SrX (Apple pro liferation) and subgroup 16SrIII-A (Peach X disease) were respectively detected in Fieberiella florii (Stål) and Philaenus spumarius L.. Further RFLP analyses on R16(X)F1/R1 amplicons from F. florii with Rsa I and Ssp I restriction enzymes allowed the identification of ‚ Ca. P. prunorum™ (table 1). The finding of ‚ Ca. P. prunorum™ in cherry trees indicates an epidemic inside and around the experimental plum orchards. These phytoplasmas were detected also in a number of plum plants under evaluation for ESFY resistance/tolerance. The finding of 16SrIII-A phytoplasmas in two declining cherry trees represent the first evidence of this phytoplasma presence in cherry in Italy. Previous reports of 16SrIII phytoplasmas in cherry only refers to ribosomal 164 Figure 1.

The same phytoplasmas were identified in P. spumarius from yellow sticky traps confirming presence of this phytoplasma in the environment. However, the role of this insect as possible phytoplasma vector is under investigation in several different environments. The scarcity of captures of C. pruni and the contemporeneous identification of ‚ Ca . P. prunorum™ in F. florii represent a finding that deserves extensive further investigations. It is necessa ry to reevaluate the insect vector pattern of ESFY especially in s outhern European stone fruit cultivation areas and in the warmest European regions.
