Abstract 
A  network  was  created  in  France  to  obtain  data  on  the  seasonal activity  of  the
psyllid Cacopsylla  pruni,  vector  of  European  stone  fruit  yellows  phytoplasma. C.
pruni was collected on Prunus plants by beating trays. The insect was found in every
prospected area. The reimmigrants (adults that have overwintered) were found on
Prunus from February to May and the new generation from May to June. Not any
C.  pruni  was  found  on Prunus  after July. Prunus  spinosa  appeared  the  preferred
host  plant  compared  to  the  other  monitored  Prunus.  The  data  are  discussed  in
relation to the control of the phytoplasma disease.

INTRODUCTION

European  stone  fruit  yellows  (ESFY)  is  a  disease  of  increasing  importance  in
France in apricot and Japanese plum orchards. The causal agent is a phytoplasma. After
the discovery of Cacopsylla pruni as vector of ESFY (Carraro et al., 1998), it appears that
there were very few data on the distribution and life cycle of this insect in France. Only 2
publications reported the species in France (Lambertie, 1910 ; Malenovsky, 1999). Thus a
network joining several French research and/or development institutes was established. Its
general  objective  was  to  produce  data  which  can  be  a  basis  to    propose  a  pest
management strategy against the insect in order to stop or to decrease the incidence of the
disease. The first objectives of the network were 1) to confirm the presence of C. pruni in
the different geographic areas where the ESFY had been detected, 2) to  make clear the
periods of presence of C. pruni on Prunus plants and 3) to determine the prefered host
plants.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The network and the location of the collecting sites

Several  people  of  different  institutes  (see  acknowledgments) joined together  to

obtain a coverage of the most important stone fruit production areas in France (fig 1).

The seasonal evolution of the abundance of C. pruni was recorded at each location
by regular sampling on host plants (one sample per week during the period from January
to  July ;  one  sample  per  two  weeks  during  the  remaining  period)  during  3  successive
years (2000 - 2002). Several Prunus species were sampled with at least one sample taken
from Prunus spinosa to be able to compare the data between locations.

Standardised protocol to count C. pruni:

As many different people were implied in the project, the data had to be collected
with a same and simple protocol to be compared. The sample unit was defined as a serie
of 20 branches  beaten upon a 0.5 m_ beating tray. The C. pruni falling on the tray were

directly counted or collected with a mouth aspirator to confirm later their identity under a
stereomicroscope.

Host plants monitored

Depending on the area, several of the following Prunus species were sampled : P.

armeniaca, P. cerasifera, P. domestica, P. salicina, P. spinosa.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Presence of C. pruni on P. spinosa : Comparison of Locations and Years

C.  pruni was  recorded  at  each  location,  which  proved  that  it  was  present

throughout the studied area.

The seasonal variations of the abundance of C. pruni followed a general bimodal
shape (fig. 2). The first peak of abundance corresponds to the presence of winter forms
(reimmigrants)  characterized  by  their  dark  color.  The  second  peak,  when  present,
corresponds to the adults of the new generation, characterized by their light color. Thus
the data are in agreement with the hypothetical life cycle of C. pruni with one generation
per  year and  an  alternation  between Prunus  as  reproduction  plant  and  other  plants  as
overwintering shelters.

The  arrivals  of  reimmigrants  on  Prunus plants were noticed  at  the  end  of  the
winter. They ranged from mid-February on the Mediterranean border to the second part of
March in Alsace-Lorraine. The highest population level was reached in March-April and
the  last  reimmigrants  diseappeared  before  the  second  week  of  May  everywhere.  The
adults of the new generation were caught on Prunus in May-June. Few variations in the
period of presence were observed between the 3 years for a defined place. The differences
in  abundance  are  difficult  to  interpret  because  the  collection  with  beating  trays  are
subjected to changing environmental factors (wind, rain, ...)

From every location, very few insects were recovered from Prunus after the end of

June and no one after August.

Host Plant Preference

The mean numbers of C. pruni (adults reimmigrants and new generation) caught
on each Prunus species was calculated (table 1). The preferred host plants appeared to be
P.  spinosa,  followed  by  P.  cerasifera,  P.  salicina and P.  domestica.  While regularly
caught  on  P. armeniaca, few C.  pruni were  caught  on  this Prunus species.    Moreover
most of them were caught in orchards where P. domestica or P. cerasifera were used as
rootstock and provided an abundant sucker production. In some cases nymphs were also
monitored (table 2) : fewer nymphs were caught on apricot trees than on P. domestica and
P. cerasifera rootstocks or on wild P. spinosa.

In  the  location  where  C.  pruni was  monitored  on  several  Prunus species,  the
populations fluctuated at  the  same  time  (table  3)  :  this  suggests  that  the reimmigrants
came  at  the  same  time  in  the  orchards  and  on  the  wild  Prunus and that  there  is  no
population differentiation according to the host plant.

CONCLUSIONS

C.  pruni was  recorded  in  all  the  regions  where  ESFY  is  epidemic,  which is  in
agreement with the hypothesis that this insect is the main (and most likely unique) natural
vector  of  this  phytoplasma.  The  wild  Prunus species  P.  spinosa  appeared  to  be  its
prefered  host  plant,  which  is  in  agreement  with  the  previous  entomological records in

Proc. XIXth IS on Fruit Tree Virus Diseases, G. Llàcer (eds), Acta Hort. 657, ISHS 2004, p 465-470

different countries (Lauterer, 1999 ; Ossiannillsonn, 1992 ). The facts that the different
Prunus species appeared to be colonised at the same time and that the populations of C.
pruni are always more abundant on P. spinosa allows to consider P. spinosa as a sentinel
species : the monitoring of C.  pruni to detected the first activity of the insect could be
performed more easily on P. spinosa than in orchards.

Adults  and  nymphs  of  C.  pruni were  collected more often on Prunus rootstock
than on the apricot varieties themselves. Thus, jointly to the elimination of infected stone
fruit trees in the orchards, a careful elimination of suckers from rootstock of P. domestica
or P. cerasifera is advised to prevent both colonisation and reproduction of C. pruni in the
orchard, and perhaps inoculation of ESFY phytoplasma through the rootstock. If specific
phytosanitary  treatments  have  to  be  applied  against  C.  pruni,  they  should  take  into
account the biology of the insect : an application before the peak of arrivals could prevent
the  reproduction  of  C. pruni  in  the  orchards  and  might  decrease  the  speed  of  ESFY
epidemics.  On  the  contrary  any  application  later  than  the  month  of  June  will  have  no
effect as at that time the insects are away from the Prunus.
