ABSTRACT

A list is presented of the 38 plant-lice or Psyllidae recorded from
British Columbia. Keys to the species are given with locality records, together
with an additional 28 species recorded from adjacent areas of Alberta, Wash-
ington and Alaska, The keys are adapted from those given in monographs by
Crawford (1914), Caldwell (1938a) and Tuthill (1943) with the addition of ten
species not included in their keys. INTRODUCTION the University of British Columbia and brought to

Jensen, Of these three only one, pararibesiae, is recorded from
the area of interest: ribesiae being recorded from no nearer than
Oregon and notapennis being restricted to California, Prom Jen
sen's descriptions I surmise that the complex of all three species
would key out as ribesiae in ‘Tuthill’s (1943) key. T have there
