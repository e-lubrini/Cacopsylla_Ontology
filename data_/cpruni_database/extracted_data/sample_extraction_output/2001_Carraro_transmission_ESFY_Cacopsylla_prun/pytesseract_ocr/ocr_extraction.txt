Abstract

A study was carried out on the transmission parameters of the European stone fruit yellows phytoplasma by the
vector Cacopsylla pruni. In the greenhouse, using groups of psyllids, the minimum acquisition period was 2-4
days, the minimum latent period 2-3 weeks and the minimum inoculation period 1-2 days. The vectors retained
infectivity until their death. Under natural conditions retention of infectivity in C. pruni lasts through the winter
and the following spring, when the overwintering insects reach the stone fruit trees, they are already infected and
infective. The research shows that the vector C. pruni transmits the European stone fruit yellows phytoplasma in a

persistent manner.

Introduction

The most common vectors of phytoplasmas are
leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) (Chiykowski,
1981; Sinha, 1984; Tsai, 1979), but the transmis-
sion characteristics of only a few of them are known,
i.e, aster yellows (Chiykowski and Sinha, 1969),
X disease (Purcell, 1979), clover phyllody (Cousin
et al., 1968), beet leafhopper transmitted virescence
agent (Golino et al., 1987) and maize bushy stunt
(Legrand and Power, 1994). It should also be remem-
bered that psyllids are among the vectors of phyto-
plasmas. Jensen et al. (1964) showed that pear psylla
(Psylla pyricola Férster, now Cacopsylla pyricola
Forster) transmitted ‘a virus’ capable of causing
pear decline. More recently transmissions of pear
decline-phytoplasma have been obtained in France
(Lemoine, 1991) and in Italy (Carraro et al., 1998a)
by Cacopsylla pyri L. Other Cacopsylla spp. have
been identified as phytoplasma vectors. Carraro et al.
(1998c) ascertained that Cacopsylla pruni Scopoli

is the vector of ESFY-phytoplasma. Alma et al.
(2000) and Frisinghelli et al. (2000) identified respec-
tively Cacopsylla melanoneura (Forster, 1848) and
Cacopsylla costalis (Flor, 1861) as vectors of the
apple proliferation-phytoplasma. Pear decline, ESFY
and apple proliferation agents are genetically related,
all belonging to the phylogenetic group ‘apple prolif-
eration’ (Seemiiller et al., 1998); therefore there is a
high correlation between this group of typically epi-
demic fruit tree diseases and related psyllids. Up to now
there has been no precise information regarding the
transmission parameters of phytoplasmas by psyllids.
A knowledge of the chronological phases of the trans-
mission process, i.e., acquisition, latency, inoculation
and retention of infectivity in the vector (Purcell, 1982),
is of fundamental importance for epidemiological stud-
ies and research aimed at preventing such diseases.

In this paper we report the results of a study
aimed at determining the transmission characteristics
of ESFY-phytoplasma by using the vector C. pruni.
To understand the paper better it must be remembered

  

696

that the insect has one generation per year and over-
winters as adult on shelter plants (conifers). Around
the end of March, C. pruni moves from shelter plants
to stone fruit trees for oviposition. The new generation
feed on the primary hosts from May till the beginning
of July, when the adults abandon the stone fruit trees
(Conci et al., 1992).

Materials and methods
General conditions

All the transmission trials were performed in a condi-
tioned greenhouse, at 22-24°C under supplementary
light. Sources of inoculum were young Prunus salicina
Lindl. (cv Ozark Premier) micropropagated plants,
previously infected by budding. Healthy Myrobalan
(Prunus cerasifera Ehrh.) micropropagated plants,
grown in a separate greenhouse, acted as test plants
for psyllid transmissions. After exposure to inocula-
tive C. pruni (25 insects per plant), the test plants were
sprayed with insecticides and grown in an isolated
greenhouse compartment, where they were observed
for eight months for symptoms expression and then
analyzed by PCR/RFLP.

Acquisition access period (AAP)

The colonies of C. pruni used in the transmission tri-
als were derived from overwintering adults and were
(10 insects per plant) put onto healthy Myrobalan
plants in the greenhouse. One week after oviposi-
tion, the adults were killed. Young insects were col-
lected immediately after the eggs had opened and caged
for AAPs of 1, 2, 4 and 7 days on ESFY-infected
sources of inoculum. After each AAP, ten groups of
25 insects were transferred to test plants, and main-
tained till their death. Longevity of the insects was
checked 15, 30 and 45 days after the beginning of inoc-
ulation. Four groups of 25 insects were PCR/RFLP
tested for ESFY-phytoplasma before acquisition and
other four groups (one for each trial) at the end of
each AAP.

Inoculation access period (IAP)

Psyllids were captured in May from Japanese plum
trees in orchards having a high percentage of
ESFY-infected trees. Groups of 25 adults were exposed

to test plants for IAPs of 1, 2, 4 and 7 days and then
removed. For each IAP, ten Myrobalan test plants were
used. The survival of the psyllids was checked daily.
At the end of each IAP, four groups of 25 insects were
PCR/RFLP-tested for ESFY-phytoplasma.

Latent period (LP)

Groups of adults, captured in April from plum tree
orchards, were caged inside the greenhouse on sources
of inoculum for oviposition. The second instar insects
of the new generation were then collected and used for
serial transmission trials. Twenty groups of 25 C. pruni
were moved weekly onto new test plants till their death,
fora total of five transfers. Four groups of psyllids were
PCR/RFLP-tested before starting the transmission trial
in order to ascertain their infectivity.

Retention of infectivity

From previous experience, we knew that longevity of
the new generation of C. pruni on stone fruit trees in the
greenhouse and in the screenhouse can reach a maxi-
mum period of two months. In fact, caged insects die
in the greenhouse when in nature the new adults are
abandoning the primary hosts (July). As it was impos-
sible to complete the life cycle of C. pruni under con-
trolled conditions, retention of infectivity in the vectors
was studied in insects that had overwintered. During
daily surveys in ESFY-infected orchards, in March, we
captured the first adults colonizing the stone fruit trees
and immediately transferred them, in six groups of 25
insects, onto test plants in the greenhouse. Meantime,
four other groups of the same psyllids were used for
PCR/RFLP analyses. The six groups of C. pruni were
transferred weekly onto new test plants. After 28 days
(four transfers) the surviving psyllids, split into two
groups of 20 individuals, were confined to two other
test plants.

Testing for the presence of phytoplasmas in
test plants and in psyllids

As the Myrobalan test plants do not show clear symp-
toms of ESFY (Carraro et al., 1998b), positivity of
transmission using C. pruni was based on the results of
PCR/RELP analyses. We examined all the inoculated
test plants, the sources of inoculum, a representative
number of negative and positive controls, as well as
groups of C. pruni collected during each transmission

trial. DNA was isolated from approximately 1g of
leaf petioles and midrib tissues of each test plant and
from individual groups of psyllids. A modification
of the phytoplasma enrichment procedure developed
by Kirkpatrick (Malisano et al., 1996) was used for
the DNA extraction from plants and Doyle and Doyle
method (1990) for extraction of insect DNA. The
presence of ESFY-phytoplasma was determined by
PCR using the ribosomal primers f01/r01 (Lorenz
et al., 1995). Five microlitre of the PCR products were
analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel in
TAE buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8)
in the presence of 0.5 g/ml ethidium bromide. Ten
microlitre of the PCR products were diges'
BsaAl, according to the manufacturer's ins
(BioLabs). Restriction fragments were resolved in
a 5% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the
DNA was stained with silver nitrate.

  

Results
Acquisition access period

None of the test plants inoculated with C. pruni that
had fed on the ESFY-sources of inoculum for | or 2
days became infected. In contrast, three out of 10 of
the test plants inoculated by C. pruni that had fed for
4 or 7 days were infected (Table 1). The mortality of
the insects was equally distributed among the groups
of C. pruni: it was 10%, 20% and 55%, respectively,
15, 30 and 45 days after the beginning of the inocu-
lations. The groups of insects tested by PCR/RFLP

697

before acquisition or 1 day after, were ESFY-free;
however, the insects tested after AAPs of 2, 4 or 7 days
were ESFY-infected.

Inoculation access period

C. pruni transmitted ESFY-phytoplasma after an inoc-
ulation period of 2 days (one test plant infected out of
the 10 inoculated) but not after 1 day of IAP. The per-
centage of infected test plants increased when inocu-
lated for 4 days (30%) and 7 days (50%) (Table 1). No
mortality of the test insects was observed at the end of
each IAP. All the four groups of insects analyzed by
PCR/RFLP at the conclusion of the experiment were
ESFY-infected.

Latent period

Among the twenty groups of insects used in this exper-
iment, six transmitted at least once ESFY-phytoplasma
to the test plants. The data of these multiple transmis-
sions are shown in Table 2. One group began to trans-
mit during the second week of exposure, one during the
third, two during the fourth and, finally, two groups dur-
ing the last week. Three of the four groups of C. pruni
PCR/RFLP tested at the beginning of the experiment
were ESFY-infected.

Retention of infectivity

The results concerning retention of infectivity in
C. pruni are shown in Table 3. Three out of the

acquisition access periods (AAP)(1) and inoculation access periods (IAP)(2). Positivity of
transmission to test plants was based on PCR analyses for ESFY-phytoplasma, The data of
PCR analyses on test psyllids are also reported (3)

six groups of C. pruni transmitted the ESFY-agent dur-

noted that two of these groups of psyllids transmitted
the ESFY-phytoplasma to all the exposed plants; one
group of insects never transmitted the agent; two groups
transmitted it only during the second week of exposure
to test plants. Also the two test plants inoculated using
the insects that survived the four weeks of transmission
trials were infected. The ESFY-agent was also detected
in the four groups of insects tested at the beginning of
the experiment.

 

  

Phytoplasma detection in plants and psyllids

Using the primer pair f01/r01, ESFY-phytoplasma
DNA was amplified from all the positive controls
and sources of inoculum as well as from part of the
test plants and groups of psyllids used in the trials.
After digestion with BsaAl, the PCR products obtained
from all the samples always showed the same ESFY-
restriction profile.

Discussion

The work carried out was difficult mainly, because
C. pruni is not easy to handle. Itis impossible to get the
insects to complete their life cycle in the greenhouse
and woody test plants must be used. This is why we
decided to use groups and not single insects, as pre-
viously with other vectors and phytoplasmas (Carraro
et al., 1996). Besides, we chose P. cerasifera as the test
plant because it is a good host both for the phytoplasma
and its vector, though it is tolerant to ESFY. In spite of
these difficulties the data obtained show the transmis-
sion characteristics of ESFY-phytoplasma by C. pruni.

The minimum period of acquisition ranges from
2 to 4 days; the efficiency of transmission does not
increase by lengthening the AAP. Healthy C. pruni,
after 2 days of AAP, were ESFY-infected but they did
not succeed in transmitting the agent to the test plants.
Non-transmission by vectors carrying phytoplasmas,
already observed in C. pyri and pear decline (Carraro
et al., 2001) could be due to several factors e.g. sus-
ceptibility of the test plant, long latency period in the
vector or intermittent transmission.

We proved the existence of a measurable latent
period and consequently the transmission is of a per-
sistent type. As can be deduced from the first group of
C. pruni in Table 2, the minimum latent period lasts
between 2 and 3 weeks. In fact, the insects that could
acquire the phytoplasma immediately after egg open-
ing, were used for inoculation trials one week later and
they transmitted ESFY-phytoplasma during the second
weekly transfer onto test plant. Other groups of insects
transmitted for the first time during the third, fourth or
fifth transfer; this indicates that the latent period can
be variable in length. The fact that all the six groups of
psyllids transmitted ESFY during the last transfer indi-
cates that retention of infectivity does not decrease up
to that period and consequently it is certainly longer.

 

By using naturally infected C. pruni collected from
ESFY-infected orchards, the length of the minimum
inoculation period was between 1 and 2 days; increas-
ing IAP also enhanced the efficiency of transmission.

To complete the study on retention of ESFY-
phytoplasma in C. pruni, in addition to the informa-
tion obtained from ‘latency’ experiments conducted in
the greenhouse, we used the first overwintering insects
recolonizing the stone fruit trees. Carraro et al. (1998c)
proved that in July, when the adults of the new gener-
ation of C. pruni abandon the stone fruit trees infected
by ESFY to move to the shelter plants, they are highly
infective. In this research we demonstrated that in the
spring, when the overwintering insects reach the pri-
mary hosts, they are already infected and infective. In
fact, three out of six of the groups of C. pruni used in
the specific experiment were able to transmit the phy-
toplasma to the first test plant inoculated in the serial
transmission trials. The psyllids continued to transmit
the agent in a persistent manner up to their death. We
also proved that the three groups of C. pruni transmit-
ted the ESFY-phytoplasma retained over the winter and
not newly acquired in the spring from the stone fruit
trees, on which they were captured. Daily inspections
eliminated this possibility as they could not have been
present on these primary hosts from more than one day.
Moreover, at this time plum trees were in winter dor-
mancy, without leaves. Finally, no latency in the trans-
mission phase was noticed, indicating that acquisition
had occurred a long time before.

In conclusion, the results obtained in this research
show that the vector C. pruni transmits the ESFY-
phytoplasma in a typical persistent manner, with a
minimum acquisition period of 2-4 days, a minimum
latency of 2-3 weeks and a minimum inoculation
period of 1-2 days. The vectors retain the infectivity
up to their death, both in the greenhouse and in nature,
as already proved for C. pyricola and pear decline
(Davies et al., 1998). In the spring, the retained agent
can be transmitted immediately by the overwinter-
ing insects, without any previous recharge feeding, as
demonstrated also for C. pyri and pear decline (Carraro
etal., 2001). These results, besides clarifying the trans-
mission characteristics of phytoplasmas by psyllids,
are also useful for planing possible defence measures:
control of the overwintering generations of C. pruni
seems to be of fundamental importance. It is impor-
tant to know that the active presence of C. pruni on the
primary hosts does not persist after the end of June to
beginning of July, under our conditions.

699

Further investigations are necessary to determine
other important aspects of the epidemiology of ESFY
such as the exact nature of the persistent transmission:
circulative or propagative. More precise information
about the groups of 25 psyllids resulted ESFY-positive
by PCR and unable to transmit the disease is also
expected from planned experiments using single or
small groups of insects.
