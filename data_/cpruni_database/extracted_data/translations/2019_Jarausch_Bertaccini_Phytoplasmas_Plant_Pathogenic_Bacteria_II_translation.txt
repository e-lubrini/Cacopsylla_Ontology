Abstract ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ species are mostly transmitted from plant to
plant by phloem feeding hemipterans, primarily leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) and
planthoppers (Fulgoroidea) (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha). However, there is one
group of phytoplasmas, the 16SrX or apple proliferation group, whose members are
transmitted by psyllid vectors of the superfamily Psylloidea (Hemiptera,
Sternorrhyncha). These psyllid-transmitted phytoplasmas are genetically closely
related and are associated with economically important diseases of fruit trees such
as pear decline, apple proliferation and European stone fruit yellows. The psyllid
vector species of these phytoplasmas are also closely related and all belong to the
genus Cacopsylla. Both, phytoplasmas and psyllid vectors, are geographically lim-
ited to the Palaearctic region, mainly Europe. Only pear decline and peach yellow
leaf roll phytoplasmas have probably been introduced to America along with their
vectors. As phytoplasma-infected trees cannot be cured and resistant plant material
is not available to the growers, preventive control measures such as vector control
are of paramount importance to limit the spread of these diseases. Thus, detailed

3.1 Introduction

The jumping plant-lice or psyllids form the well-defined superfamily Psylloidea
which belongs to the suborder Sternorrhyncha of the order Hemiptera. About 4.000
species of this superfamily are described worldwide including about 400 species in
Europe (Burckhardt 1994; Burckhardt and Ouvrard 2012). All recognised phyto-
plasma vectors are found in the genus Cacopsylla which is part of the subfamily
Psyllinae within the family Psyllidae (Weintraub and Beanland 2006; Burckhardt
and Ouvrard 2012). An electronic determination key for the most important
Cacopsylla species found on Rosaceae in Europe is available at the internet by
www.psyllidkey.eu (Burckhardt et al. 2008). Table 3.1 gives an introductive over-
view of the most important phytoplasma diseases and their agents which are

transmitted by psyllid vectors. So far, all important fruit crop diseases associated
with the presence of phytoplasmas of the group 16SrX are vectored by psyllids. The basic geographical distribution of the most important psyllid vectors in
Europe and neighbouring regions has been sed during the COST action
FA0807 and is available online (Costphytoplasma 2013). Psyllids are phloem feeders and both nymphs and adults feed on plant sap. Depending on the species, the eggs are laid on the new buds, in crevices of the bark
or on leaves where they can produce pit-like deformations on the leaf blade
(Hodkinson 2009). The nymph development passes through five instars which are
more or less strongly flattened dorso-ventrally (Burckhardt 1994). Phytoplasma
vector species on apple and stone fruits are — like other North temperate psyllids —
univoltine whereas pear psyllids with the exception of Cacopsylla pyrisuga (Foerster
1848) are mostly polyvoltine with overlapping generations. Polyvoltine vector spe-
cies usually overwinter as adults on or near to their host plants. Univoltine vector
species have an obligate emergence as imagines (= emigrants) to their overwinter-
ing plants, such as conifers, and return to their respective reproduction host plants
in spring (= remigrants) (Mayer et al. 2011; Burckhardt 1994). This applies for
Cacopsylla pruni, C. melanoneura and C. picta (Thébaud et al. 2009; Mayer and
Gross 2007; Cermak and Lauterer 2008; Tedeschi et al. 2002; Jarausch et al. 2013;
Jarausch and Jarausch 2014, 2016). In these cases overwintering was observed only
on conifers at higher altitudes (Mayer and Gross 2007; Thébaud et al. 2009; Pizzinat
et al. 2011; Ulubas Serge et al. 2011). Migration to the respective reproduction or
overwintering plant seems to be direct and may take place even over long distances. Plant volatiles are exploited by the psyllids to find their reproduction host plants or
overwintering plants during migration (Gross 2016; Mayer and Gross 2007; Mayer
etal. 2011). As phytoplasmas are phloem-limited, only phloem-feeding insects can poten-
tially acquire and transmit the pathogen (Weintraub and Beanland 2006). The
insects acquire the phytoplasma during feeding in the phloem of infected plants. The following process of phytoplasma passage and multiplication in the insect body
comprises the latent or incubation phase and the infectivity period where the insect
can transmit the pathogen. Detailed descriptions of the cellular processes of trans-
port and multiplication in the insect body have been reported for leafhoppers
(Weintraub and Beanland 2006; Hogenhout et al. 2008). So far, these mechanisms
of phytoplasma transmission remain to be demonstrated for psyllid vectors as well. Several publications show that psyllids transmit the pathogen in a persistent propa-
gative manner (Carraro et al. 2001a, b; Thébaud et al. 2009). The length of time
needed for an individual to become infectious seems to differ among the psyllid
vectors. However, it is of paramount importance for the disease spread by univoltine
vectors: vectors with a long latent phase predominantly transmit the phytoplasma
after overwintering when remigrating into the orchards (monocyclic disease spread
on regional scale). In contrast, vectors with a short latent phase transmit the phyto-
plasma already before migration as well as after overwintering (polycyclic disease
spread on local and regional scale) (Jarausch et al. 2013). Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019

56 B. Jarausch et al. 3.2 Cacopsylla picta

Cacopsylla picta (Foerster 1848) (Figs. 3.1 and 3.2) is distributed only in Europe
and is monophagous on Malus spp. (Jarausch and Jarausch ; Ouvrard ). The insect completes one generation per year and overwinters as adult on conifers. At the end of winter (March/April), C. picta remigrants move from the overwinter-

ing sites to apple trees for oviposition (Jarausch and Jarausch 2014). The insects of
the new generation (emigrants) feed on their reproduction host until the beginning
of July when they leave the apple trees as adults (Mattedi et al. ; Jarausch et al. ). Findings of phytoplasma-infected individuals of C. picta have been reported
from many different countries: Italy, Germany, Bosnia-Herzegovina, France,
Switzerland, Finland, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Spain and Croatia (Frisinghelli

  

et al. ; Jarausch et al. . ; Carraro et al. ; Delié et al. 5
Lemmetty et al. ; Ludvikova et al. ; Etropolska et al. ; Miiiarro et al. ; KrizZanac et al. ). In north-east Italy, the natural infection rate of C. picta
was found between 9% and 13%, respectively for overwintering and offspring
adults (Carraro et al. 2008). In the main apple growing regions of Italy, Trentino and
Alto Adige (South Tyrol) (Italy), mean infection rates of 6% (Mattedi et al. ),
11% (Baric et al. )) and 20% (Fischnaller et al. ) for remigrants were

reported. In Germany, about 10% of overwintered C. picta were found naturally

infected with the pathogen every year (Jarausch et al. 2004, 2007a, 2011). Data for
Northern Switzerland (10%) (Jarausch et al. 2011), Western France (Alsace: 14%)
(Jarausch et al. 2011), Finland (11%) (Lemmetty et al. 2011) and Spain (13%)
(Mifiarro et al. 2016) were in a similar range. A lower infection rate of roughly 3%
was reported from Bulgaria (Etropolska et al. 2015). Jarausch et al. (2011) found no
significant relationship between the infection status of the orchard and the infection
rate of C. picta remigrants captured within these orchards, although a tendency of
higher infection rates in abandoned orchards was observed. These data can be explained by a regional dispersal of remigrant individuals and
by a certain percentage of transovarial transmission of the phytoplasma as detected
by Mittelberger et al. (2017). During experimental transmission trials in different
laboratories in Germany and Italy it was confirmed that both emigrants and remi-
grants of C. picta can transmit the agent efficiently (Jarausch et al. 2004, 2007a,
2011; Carraro et al. 2008; Mattedi et al. 2008). However, the transmission efficiency

Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019

58 B. Jarausch et al. was usually higher with remigrants (range of 8-45% with groups of 5 individuals)
than with emigrants (range of 2-20% with groups of up to 20 individuals) (Jarausch
et al. 2011). Both, males and females, can transmit the phytoplasma and are natu-
rally infected to a similar percentage. As males and females are present in the
orchards at a ratio of 1:1.4 (Jarausch et al. 2011), both genders can contribute to the
spread of apple proliferation phytoplasma (‘Ca. P. mali’). The phytoplasma concentration in the infected individuals of C. picta was
extremely high and ranged between 10° and 10% as measured by quantitative PCR
(Jarausch et al. 2011; Mayer et al. 2009). Phytoplasma-infected and infective psyl-
lids appeared among the first remigrants of C. picta in apple orchards in early spring,
indicating winter-retention of the pathogen (Jarausch et al. 2011; Mattedi et al. 2008). Furthermore, phytoplasma concentrations in the remigrants were constantly
high and did not differ significantly during the first 7 weeks after arrival in the
orchard (Jarausch et al. 2011). Thus, remigrants are considered to be infective dur-
ing their whole life span on apple after overwintering. Although remigrants readily
transmitted the phytoplasma under experimental conditions, this could not be veri-
fied by bait plant trails in the orchard: natural transmission in the orchards in
Trentino was found to be situated during the migration period of the new generation
of C. picta (Mattedi et al. 2008). Transmission by emigrants before leaving the
orchard is not also supported by experimental transmission t , but also by quan-
titative PCR data which indicate that ‘Ca. P. mali’ multiplies very quickly to high
concentrations after experimental acquisition (Pedrazzoli et al. 2007). Individuals
born on infected plants acquired the phytoplasma to nearly 100% while new adults
emerged on healthy plants and fed thereafter on infected plants had only an acqui
tion rate of about 10% (Jarausch et al. 2010). In conclusion, C. picta is able to transmit ‘Ca. P. mali’ during the entire period
when they are present on apple trees. As remigrants as well as emigrants are able to
transmit, a polycyclic disease spread is supposed in which remigrants disperse the
pathogen on a regional as well as local scale and emigrants on a local scale (Jarausch
et al. 2011). Although the population density of C. picta in the orchards is usually
low (Jarausch et al. 2009, 2011), this species is considered to be the main vector of
apple proliferation wherever it is present. In Germany, C. picta transmits all three ‘Ca. P. mali’ subtypes AT-1, AT-2 and AP
as defined by Jarausch et al. (2000) (W. Jarausch, unpublished data) while in Alto
Adige (South Tyrol) (Italy) the spread of apple proliferation seems to be predomi-
nantly linked to the transmission of subtype AT-2 by C. picta (Baric et al. 2011). All
three subtypes were also identified in C. picta of North East Italy (Martini et al. 2008). C. picta individuals captured in Finland were infected with subtypes AT-2
and AP (Lemmetty et al. 2011). Jarausch et al. (2010) also reported differences in
acquisition, multiplication and transmission efficiencies among different strains of
“Ca. P. mali’. Interestingly, strains which multiplied best in the insect exhibited the
lowest titers in apple plantlets. Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019

3.3. Cacopsylla melanoneura

Cacopsylla melanoneura (Fig. 3.3) has a holo-Palaearctic distribution and is oli-
gophagous on Rosaceae plants such as Crataegus spp., Malus domestica, Mespilus
germanica and Pyrus communis (Ouvrard ). This species was originally
described as hawthorn psyllid (Lal ;, Ossiannilsson ; Lauterer ), while
successively it has become an economically injurious pest of apple trees in particu-
lar in relation to the spreading of the apple proliferation disease (Alma et al. S

60 B. Jarausch et al. Tomasi et al. 2000; Tedeschi et al. 2002). In most of the areas where the presence of
the disease has been recorded, C. melanoneura and C. picta occur sympatrically
(Jarausch et al. 2003; Delié et al. 2005; Mattedi et al. 2008; Miiiarro et al. 2016), in
some others (Northwestern Italy and Norway) only C. melanoneura has been
reported (Tedeschi et al. 2002; Brede 2017). Several studies on natural infection rate and vector ability of this species revealed
a diversified scenario. Generally in apple growing regions where C. melanoneura
and C. picta coexist, the latter has a major vector role (Frisinghelli et al. 2000:
Mattedi et al. 2008; Jarausch et al. 2003, 2004, 2007a), while C. melanoneura has
been considered ineffective in transmitting “Ca. P. mali’ (Mayer et al. 2009). On the
contrary in the areas where C. picta does not occur, in particular in Northwestern
Italy, C. melanoneura has an important role in the spreading of the disease (Tedeschi
et al. 2002, 2003; Tedeschi and Alma 2004). Indeed, natural infection rates in apple
orchards is very low, less than 1% in Germany, Northern Switzerland, Eastern
France (Mayer et al. 2009); but ranging from 4.2% (0,6% in average) in South Tyrol
(Northeastern Italy) (Baric et al. 2010; Fischnaller et al. 2017) to 56.2% in Trentino
region (Northeastern Italy) where the role of this insect as vector of ‘Ca. P. mali’ has
been recently reviewed (Malagnini et al. 2010; Tedeschi et al. 2012), and reaching
around 4% and up to 45% in a 100% infected orchard in Northwestern Italy
(Tedeschi et al. 2003). Moreover, against a non-trans! ion reported in Germany,
0.36% of infected plants were obtained after transmission trials with C. melano-
neura from Trentino (Northeastern Italy) (Mattedi et al. 2008), while in Northwestern
Italy 29.4% of plants inoculated with naturally infected overwintered adults (88.9%
in the case of insects collected in a 85% infected orchard) tested positive to ‘Ca. P.
mali’ (Tedeschi and Alma 2004). Due to the fact that these transmission trials were
carried out using batches of around 20 specimens/test plant, a range of 1.4—-8.4% of
probability of transmission by a single C. melanoneura was estimated in
Northwestern Italy (Tedeschi and Alma 2006). In particular it was highlighted the
crucial role of overwintered individuals in comparison to newly emerged adults due
to a higher percentage of ‘Ca. P. mali’-positive individuals (3.6% vs. 0.8%) and a
longer period spent in apple orchards (14.6 vs. 6 weeks) (Tedeschi et al. 2002,
2003). These differences in relation to vector attitude of C. melanoneura are con-
firmed also by the phytoplasma titre in the insect. In Germany, the maximum phy-
toplasma concentration never exceeded 40,000 copies/individual in field collected
insects, far below the minimum titre threshold found for an effective transmission
by C. picta (10°—108 phytoplasma DNA copies) (Jarausch et al. 2007a, 2011; Mayer
et al. 2009). However, in Northwestern Italy ‘Ca. P. mali’ reached a concentration
of 10‘-10° copies/individual C. melanoneura (Monti et al. 2013). The life cycle is
similar to that of C. picta, but the overwintering adults appear earlier in the year on
Crataegus spp. or apple trees (Mayer et al. 2011). This migration is dependent on a
temperature threshold, recorded in the orchards, which in Northeastern Italy has
been found to be around 9.5°C (Tedeschi et al. 2012). Likewise the new generation
abandons the host plant earlier (end May—June) than C. picta to migrate to the aes-
tivation and overwintering plants (Mattedi et al. 2008; Tedeschi et al. 2002). The
overwintering plants are reached, thanks to warm ascending currents, at different

altitudes depending on the geographical area, 462-535 m a.s.l. in South Moravia,
mainly 1350-1650 m a. in Northwestern Italy (Cermak and Lauterer 2008;
Pizzinat et al. 2011). Different conifer species were recorded as overwintering
plants and by caging on them newly emerged adults from hawthorn or apple plants
it was possible to follow the whole life cycle of the psyllid throughout the year
(Pizzinat et al. 2011). No correlation between immigration dynamics and apple phe-
nology could be demonstrated; however, oviposition occurs at bud burst while egg
peak and hatchings are always before the first flowering. This confirmed a good
degree of synchrony between C. melanoneura and host-plant growth, being linked
with temperatures as stated for psyllids in general by Hodkinson (2009). In order to apply well-timed control strategies, Tedeschi et al. (2012) defined an
immigration index based on the maximum temperatures of the 7 days registered in
the apple orchard, to predict the arrival of the overwintered adults. In practice, in the
Valsugana valley (Northeastern Italy) where this study was carried out, psyllids start
to reach the apple orchards when this threshold is 9.5°C. In other areas this thresh-
old should be adjusted either according to historical collection data or by program-
ming periodical field collections. Moreover, other geographical factors associated
with the winter sites location (e.g., the regional orography, the main air streams and
distance from apple orchards) may differently affect the psyllid migration process
and influence its presence or absence, both in terms of time and quantity, in a given
apple orchard (Tedeschi et al. 2012). Concerning host plants, so the plants on which C. melanoneura feed, copulate,
lay eggs and completes its immature to adult life cycle, several studies attributed
diverse roles to hawthorn or apple, depending on different geographical areas. In
Northwestern Italy, C. melanoneura is equally common in both apple orchards and
on Crataegus monogyna plants; moreover hawthorn plants have been found infected
with ‘Ca. P. mali’ entailing a possible role of this plant as a phytoplasma source of
inoculum (Tedeschi et al. 2009). On the contrary in Germany this psyllid preferred
hawthorn as host plant which, however, was not found infected with the phyto-
plasma (Mayer et al. 2009). All the different roles assigned to C. melanoneura (ic. efficiency in acquiring
and transmitting ‘Ca. P. mali’) by the studies conducted to date suggest the exi:
tence of different populations at both geographical and host plant scale (Malagnini
et al. 2010, 2013; J. Gross and R. Tedeschi, unpublished results), but also of differ-
ent combinations of psyllid populations and phytoplasma strains (Baric et al. 2011). In particular there is a strict co-occurrence of AT-1-associated subtypes of ‘Ca. P.
mali’ and C. melanoneura in several regions of Northwestern Italy, where C. mel:
noneura is considered to be the most important vector of apple proliferation (C:
et al. 2010), while in other regions where C. picta is the principal vector there is the
dominance of ‘Ca. P. mali’ subtypes AT-2 (Cainelli et al. 2004; Jarausch et al. 2000;
Baric et al. 2011) or AP (Jarausch et al. 2000, 2004; Martini et al. 2008). i

62 B, Jarausch et al. 3.4 Cacopsylla pruni

Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli 1763) (Fig. 3.4) is widespread in its native Western
Palearctic area (Ossiannilsson 1992; Steffek et al. 2012; Ouvrard 2017). This psyl-
lid species is strictly oligophagous on Prunus spp., completes one generation per
year and overwinters as an adult on conifers. At the end of winter — early spring,
according to the climatic conditions and the geographic zones, adult remigrants
move from the overwintering plants back to Prunus spp. for oviposition. They pre-
fer wild, uncultivated Prunus spp. as host plants such as P. spinosa (blackthorn) or
P. cerasifera (myrobolan) (Labonne and Lichou 2004; Jarausch et al. 2008) but they

can also reproduce on cultivated Prunus e.g. apricot, peach or European and
Japanese plum. Interestingly, remigrants were highly attracted by rootstock suckers
of apricot trees where high oviposition rates could be observed and population den-
sities of newly emerged adults were high (Labonne and Lichou 2004). The adults of
the new generation feed on their reproduction hosts until the beginning of July,
when they leave the Prunus plants to move to their overwintering plants (Carraro
et al. 2001b, 2004; Thébaud et al. 2009). So far, C. pruni is the only psyllid species
described as vector of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ (Carraro et al. 1998; Jarausch et al. 2001,
2007b, 2008; Thébaud et al. 2009; Marcone et al. 2010). A comprehensive overview
of the distribution of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ and its vector C. pruni in European fruit-
growing areas was reviewed by Steffek et al. (2012). Recently, Peccoud et al. (2013)
proposed that C. pruni is a complex of two cryptic species, provisionally named C.
pruni “A” and C. pruni “B”. Population genetics analysis with microsatellite mark-
ers (Sauvion et al. 2007) showed that the two species overlap over a large geo-
graphical area around the Mediterranean (N. Sauvion, unpublished data) and there
are indications that both cryptic species are potential vectors of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’. Naturally infected individuals of C. pruni were found in several European coun-
tries like Italy (Carraro et al. 1998), France (Yvon et al. 2004), Spain (Lavifia et al. 2004), Czech Republic (Fialova et al. 2004), Switzerland (Ramel and Gugerli 2004),
Germany (Jarausch et al. 2007b), Bosnia-Herzogovina (Delié et al. 2008), Turkey
(Ulubas Serce et al. 2011), Austria (Lethmayer et al. 2011) and Bulgaria (Etropolska
et al. 2016). Interestingly, the natural infection rate of C. pruni highly varies among
different geographical zones and in most of the described cases very few individuals
were carrying the phytoplasma in the field. In Germany, Jarausch et al. (2007b,
2008) found 2-3% of the field collected overwintered adults naturally infected by
“Ca. P. prunorum’. Similar low infection rates of only 0.6% were confirmed in
France by Jarausch et al. (2001) and Thébaud et al. (2008). In contrast, Ermacora
et al. (2011) reported infection rates in the first remigrants in apricot orchards in
Northeastern Italy of 56.4% reaching a plateau slightly exceeding 80% in the last
two captures. Ulubag Serge et al. (2011) found a mean percentage of 23% infected
individuals of C. pruni collected on P. spinosa or wild plum. Ina recent study, Maier
et al. (2013) ascertained the phytoplasma in 0-11.5% of the remigrants and in
0-3.44% of the springtime generation insects in lower Austria. The transmission of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ by different developmental stages of C.
pruni was studied in detail under controlled conditions (Carraro et al. 1998, 2001b,
2004). The overwintered adults (remigrants) as well as the adults of the new genera-
tion (emigrants) of C. pruni were able to transmit the agent to healthy test plants. The remigrants were often already infected and infectious when they reached their
Prunus hosts in early spring. The authors concluded that C. pruni transmits the
winter-retained phytoplasma that had been acquired the previous year. The overwin-
tered psyllids continued to transmit the pathogen in a persistent manner until their
death. During transmission trials under controlled conditions conducted in Germany
by Jarausch et al. (2007b, 2008), the vector capacity of overwintered and new
generation adults of C. pruni was consistently lower than that described by Carraro
et al. (2001b, 2004). Similar low infectivity and transmission rates of only 0.6%

64 B. Jarausch et al. were confirmed in France by Jarausch et al. (2001) and Thébaud et al. (2008). Thébaud et al. (2009) demonstrated that the population of C. pruni has an extremely
long “effective latency” period which lasts the overwintering period. During this
time the phytoplasma concentration within the insects continuously rises reaching a
maximum of 10’ phytoplasmas per insect at remigration. They concluded that only
overwintered adults can efficiently transmit the agent and, thus, the disease spread
is monocyclic. The vertical (transovarial) transmission of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ was not
observed by Carraro et al. (1998) and Thébaud et al. (2009) whilst Tedeschi et al. (2006) proved the existence of this passage in C. pruni. Many studies showed that
wild Prunus spp. play an essential role in the epidemiology of the disease, not only
as a reservoir of the psyllid vectors but also of the phytoplasma, in particular black-
thorn (P. spinosa) and myrobalan plum (P. cerasifera) (Jarausch et al. 2001, 2008:

 

 

Carraro et al. 2002; Fialova et al. 2004, 2007; Labonne and Lichou 2004; Laviiia
et al. 2004; Poggi Pollini et al. 2004; Yvon et al. 2004; Ramel and Gugerli 2004;
Delié et al. 2008; Maier et al. 2013). Recently, Sabaté et al. (2016) pointed out the
role of P. mahaleb as potential reservoir of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ and its vector C. pruni
in Spain. Whereas low populations of C. pruni were found on cultivated Prunus spp. such as P. armeniaca, P. persica, P. amygdalus and P. domestica, much higher vec-
tor densities were reported from different wild Prunus spp. such as P. spinosa, P.
cerasifera, P. domestica and P. salicina. Interestingly, the wild P. spinosa and P.
cerasifera, which represented reservoirs for the pathogen and the vector, rarely
showed typical symptoms (Carraro et al. 2002; Jarausch et al. 2008). In conclusion,
many wild Prunus spp. play an important role in the epidemiology of ESFY disease
as the cycle of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ as well as of its vector C. pruni can be completed
independently from the presence of infected cultivated stone fruit trees. In order to
determine the distance that psyllids could spread the pathogen by natural means,
Maier et al. (2013) tracked the dispersal of C. pruni in a model apricot orchard in
lower Austria during a mark, release and recapture experiment. The study proved a
fast and frequent tree-to-tree movement of C. pruni adults. Insects easily covered
distances from row to row or even farther (ca. 13 m) within 24 hours after release
and were present in a large part of the model orchard after 8 days (up to 24 m from
the release point). 3.5 Pear Psyllids

In Europe, three recognized or presumed vectors of pear decline disease (PD) live
on pear: Cacopsylla pyri (Linné 1758) (Fig. 3.5), C. pyricola (Foerster 1848), and
C. pyrisuga (Foerster 1848). C. pyri is reported from Europe, the Caucasus, Central
Asia, the Russian Far East and China; C. pyricola naturally occurs in the Western
Palaearctic and has been introduced into the USA and Canada in the early nine-
teenth century (Ossiannilsson 1992; Ouvrard 2017). The two species are oligopha-
gous on Pyrus species such as P. communis, P. eleagrifolia, P. pyraster, P.
amygdaliformis and P. salicifolia (Burckhardt 1994). The biology of C. pyri and C.

Entomology unit, University of Torino, Italy)

pyricola is similar since both are polyvoltine (Burckhardt and Hodkinson 1986). Thus, C. pyri can complete 4-5 generations in Central Europe and up to 8 genera-
tions in Southern France. Two morphologically distinct forms can be distinguished:
a darkish winter form (C. pyri f. pyri) and a light summer form (C. pyri f. pyrarbo-
ris). C. pyricola has 4-5 generations in France and 34 in the USA with the darker
winter form (C. pyricola f. simulans) appearing as one and the lighter summer form
(C. pyricola f. pyricola) as 3-4 generations per year, respectively. The first oviposi-
tion of the winter form coincides with raising temperatures in early spring on leave
buds and midribs of the leaves (Burckhardt 1994). In contrast, C. pyrisuga is uni-
voltine; the adults overwinter on conifers and remigrate to Pyrus spp. by middle
March to April. Egg deposition takes place in two different steps at the beginning of
April and second in the middle of May followed by a 6 week lasting nymph devel-
opment and the emergence of new adults in June. All three pear psyllids can cause
direct damage on pear trees: the nymphs affect plant growth by sucking phloem-sap,
while the secreted honeydew burns plant tissue and favours the growth of sooty
mold. First reports of pear psyllids as vectors of phytoplasmas came from the Pacific
coast of North America. Jensen et al. (1964) identified C. pyricola as the vector of
“Ca. P. pyri’ at a time when the disease was thought to be virus-borne. Since then no

66 B. Jarausch et al. further vector has been described for the USA. However, the distribution of the
putative vectors of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in Europe and the whole Palearctic region is diverse:
while for Great Britain only C. pyricola has been described as vector (Davies et al. 1992), C. pyri was identified as main vector in France (Lemoine 1984), Italy
(Carraro et al. 1998) and Spain (Garcia-Chapa et al. 2005). In Czech Republic
(Kucerova et al. 2007; Ludvikova et al. 2011) and in lower Austria (Lethmayer et al. 2011) all three pear psyllid species were found naturally infected with ‘Ca. P. pyri’,
while in Turkey only C. pyri carried the phytoplasma albeit all the three species
were present in the investigated regions (Kaya et al. 2016). In contrast to C. pyri and
C. pyricola, the vector capability of C. pyrisuga is so far not yet confirmed (Jarausch
and Jarausch 2010). Recently, a fourth pear psyllid, the polyvoltine species
Cacopsylla bidens (Sule 1907) has been found infected with ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in Bulgaria
(Etropolska et al. 2015). Also for this species its vector capability still needs to be
proven. After the identification of C. pyricola as vector for ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in California
(Jensen et al. 1964), many investigations in the USA and Europe followed in order
to determine the infection rate of the psyllids and to analyse the transmission param-
eters. In United Kindgdom transmission trials carried out with field-collected C.
pyricola yielded transmission rates between 3-61 % depending on the collection site
of the psyllids (Davies et al. 1992). Acquisition of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ by C. pyricola from
experimentally infected pear seedlings was best in August and lowest in winter. In
California, Blomquist and Kirkpatrick (2002a) detected the pathogen in both winter
and summer forms of C. pyricola, but without a clear seasonal trend. The number of
phytoplasmas per psyllid was estimated to range from 1 x 10° to 8.2 x 10’ with
higher titre in the winter form. They concluded that psyllid-mediated spring infec-
tions could happen well before ‘Ca. P. pyri’ would normally recolonize the upper
part of the tree from the roots. In Italy, Carraro et al. (1998, 2001a) detected ‘Ca. P.
pyri’ in 55% of groups of C. pyri collected from March to October in the orchards
and 30% of the inoculated test plants became infected. They could furthermore
show that C. pyri retained the phytoplasma during winter, but could not transmit PD
to dormant plants. Raddadi et al. (2011) tested C. pyri collected in Italian pear
orchards detecting ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in 26% of the specimens (in 27% of males, and in
25% of females) with nested-PCR and in 51% of the individuals through quantita-
tive PCR with a number of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ cells ranging from 1.43 x 10! to 8.50 x 10°
per C. pyri individual. Moreover, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) allowed to
detect ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in Malpighian tubules and salivary glands of C. pyri. Garci
Chapa et al. (2005) found that the percentage of infected individuals in Spain is
similar from June to August but reaching a rate of almost 100% in September coin-
ciding with the maximum phytoplasma titre in the aerial plant parts. The highest
transmission rate to an artificial sucrose medium was obtained in August and also in
October. Although th the © percentage of infected psyllids was similar for both genders,
ignificantly higher than by males. During
transmission trials under controlled conditions Caglayan et al. (2010) showed the
capability of C. pyri to transmit PD from infected pears to healthy periwinkles and
confirmed it as vector of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in Turkey. Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019

3. Psyllid Vectors 67

PD has also been found in Taiwan (PD-TW) where the European species C. pyri and
C. pyricola are not present. Liu et al. (2007) found two other Cacopsylla species, C.
qianli and C. chinensis, infected with the PD-TW phytoplasma. Their role in trans-
mission of PD-TW phytoplasma in Taiwan remains to be clarified. But recently Liu
et al. (2011) proved the transmission capacity of C. chinensis during transmission
trials in Taiwan. Based on PCR detection and symptom development they showed
that pear trees were either infected by PD-TW or PD-TWII phytoplasma strains, or
co-infected by both, when exposed to C. chinensis specimens. Insect vectors for peach yellow leaf roll (PYLR) phytoplasma have been searched
intensively in California in the 1980s and 1990s. As two similar diseases, western X
and PYLR, associated with two genetically distinct phytoplasmas exist in the same
region, only the application of molecular methods enabled to proof that a psyllid is
the main vector of PYLR phytoplasma. Experimental transmission of PYLR phyto-
plasma to peach seedlings was achieved with field collected C. pyricola from natu-
rally infected peach trees (Guerra 1997). In field surveys for leafhoppers and psyllids
in diseased peach orchards only C. pyricola proved to be infected with PYLR phy-
toplasma as confirmed by molecular means (Blomquist and Kirkpatrick 2002b). Ten
to 25% of groups of 10 individuals were positive indicating a high infection rate. Infected psyllids were captured from peach as well as from pear grown in the neigh-
bourhood. The population dynamics of C. pyricola was similar in peach and pear
with low densities in summer and an increase in autumn. Thus, the spread of PYLR
is dependent on adjacent pear orchards where presumably the vector reproduces
(Purcell et al. 1981). 3.6 Genetics

Morphological differentiation is problematic due to extensive resemblance of some
psyllid species especially among females and is error-prone for nymphs (Oettl and
Schlink 2015). DNA-based techniques for the identification of insect species have
recently become of particular interest either to support or even to replace traditional
morphological discrimination (Jenkins et al. 2012). Molecular methods offer in par-
ticular advantages for the identification of immature stages where inct morpho-
logical characters are lacking or are not sufficient for discrimination at the species
level. Furthermore, molecular methods can help to identify insects which are dam-
aged by removal from sticky traps. One approach is PCR-RFLP based on the cyto-
chrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region. This gene is widely used as barcoding
marker for species determination and provides therefore a valuable tool also for the
identification of invasive insect species and quarantine pests. This method has been
successfully applied for the molecular discrimination of C. melanoneura and C.
picta from other Cacopsylla species which are difficult to distinguish by morpho-
logical means (Oettl and Schlink 2015). This rapid and cost-effective approach
allowed also a reliable identification of nymphal stages. Tedeschi and Nardi (2010) developed a molecular tool based on the mitochon-
drial control region (CR) to distinguish psyllid species living together on hawthorn:

68 B. Jarausch et al. C. melanoneura and C. affinis. This PCR assay allowed the species identification by
ing specific primers and different sizes of the PCR products. By testing individu-
als of C. melanoneura from different regions in Italy, two genetic variants were
detected by this method. The variants differed by the presence (WI, with indel) or
the absence (WOI, without indel) of a 56 bp indel. Whereas the WOI type was
dominant in all tested regions the WI type was consistently found at low percent-
ages ranging from 5% to 31%. Recently, WI and WOI variants of C. melanoneura
were also detected by this approach in Bulgaria (Etropolska et al. 2016). A distinc-
tion of different populations of C. melanoneura was enabled by the development of
microsatellite markers for this species (Malagnini et al. 2007). With these SSR
markers populations from apple could be differentiated form those of hawthorn
indicating that two different host races of C. melanoneura may exist (Malagnini
et al. 2013). Whether these genetic differences are linked to the observed differ-
ences in phytoplasma vectoring ability is not known. Microsatellite genotyping was also applied to analyse the population structure of
C. pruni (Sauvion et al. 2007, 2009). Based on the analysis of nine microsatellite
loci two distinct populations of C. pruni—named A and B — were identified. Peccoud
et al. (2013) demonstrated that both groups can be phylogenetically separated on
their ITS2 sequences. These authors developed specific PCR primers for each group
enabling an easy molecular typing of C. pruni A and B. It is important to note that
both groups cannot be distinguished morphologically. As far as known, both popu-
lations occur sympatrically in Southern France while type B is predominant in most
of the other European regions. Etropolska et al. (2016) found only C. pruni type B
in different regions of Bulgaria. 3.7 Rearing

Although all Psylloidea pass through 5 instars, the period for complete nymph
development under natural conditions can be highly influenced by variations of
ambient temperature, humidity and voltinism status (Hodkinson 2009). This incon-
venience can be eliminated by the establishment of rearings under controlled and
standardised conditions. Breeding of polyvoltine species without host alternation
such as C. pyri can be started from field collections on Pyrus cy. all around the year. However, also multivoltine species such as C. pyricola or C. pyri undergo a repro-
ductive diapause in the autumn generation (Hodkinson 2009). Compared with poly-
voltine psyllid species, the austere life cycle and obligate host change of univoltine
species makes collection and rearing difficult. However, efforts undertaken during
the last years identified the key factors for the establishment of permanent rearings
of the univoltine species C. picta and C. pruni. The most common way to establish psyllid colonies usually starts from pairs or
groups of field collected adults which are caged on specific host plants for copula-

tion and oviposition. In order to obtain healthy psyllid populations for diverse labo-
ratory use, standardised plant material from tissue culture or from seedlings was
used, e.g. from Malus cultivars Golden Delicious or Royal Gala for C. picta and C.
melanoneura colonies (Jarausch et al. 2004; Mayer et al. 2009; Tedeschi et al. 2003)
or from Prunus cultivars P. marianna, P. salicina or P. cerasifera for C. pruni
(Carraro et al. 2001b, 2004; Jarausch et al. 2008; Thébaud et al. 2009), respectively. Since transovarial transmission of the phytoplasma has been demonstrated for C.
picta (Mittelberger et al. 2017) and C. pruni (Tedeschi et al. 2006), PCR testing of
individuals has to be done to ensure a phytoplasma-free psyllid population. For
subsequent acquisition trials, rearings were directly installed on phytoplasma-
infected Malus or Prunus cultivars under similar rearing conditions. Breedings of the most important univoltine Cacopsylla vector species C. picta,
C. melanoneura and C. pruni were installed in cages, bugdorms or glass vessels
infested with mature females and males collected from their natural host plants
from February until April (Carraro et al. 2002; Jarausch et al. 2004, 2008; Mayer
et al. 2008a; Tedeschi et al. 2003). The preimaginal development under recom-
mended rearing conditions for these northern temperate species (20-25°C day and
around 15°C night, relative humidity between 50-80% and natural day light condi-
tions of light:dark, 16:8 hours) (Jarausch and Weintraub 2014) takes about 5 weeks
until emergence of new adults. Thus, psyllid colonies could be maintained on the
reproduction host plant under experimental conditions for several months, at least
until autumn of the same year. However, as univoltine vector species have an obli-
gate alternation of plants for reproduction and overwintering, a permanent rearing
was not possible. For a long time it was believed that conifers are used by migrating
Cacopsylla species just for shelter during winter time (Burckhardt 1994; Burckhardt
et al. 2014). It remained unclear whether overwintering psyllids actually fed on
conifers (Hodkinson 2009). Recent studies confirmed that these species have a feed-
ing activity on overwintering plants (Gallinger and Gross 2018), and die when is
lated on a deciduous conifers plant such as Larix decidua (Pizzinat et al. 2011). Thus, Jarausch and Jarausch (2014) succeeded for the first time to maintain a hiber-
nating continuous colony of C. picta until the next year and hence they could estab-
lish a permanent rearing of this vector species. Based on empiric data from field
observations in combination with results obtained during laboratory experiments
they elaborated the following parameters and key factors for a successful overwin-
tering of C. picta and the establishment of a continuous rearing: (i) smooth host
plant switch, (ii) moderate summer temperatures and sufficient humidity, (iii) natu-
ral winter climate conditions with cold and frost and (iv) suitable conifer species, in
this case spruce or pine. The model suggests a direct migration of emigrants from
the reproduction host apple to conifers as aestivation and overwintering plants in
summer and vice versa to apple orchards for remigrants in early spring. However,
the host plant switch does not occur abrupt, but is characterized by a smooth adapta-
tion phase from its host for reproduction to its overwintering plants as experimen-
tally demonstrated. Despite some species-specific particularities, the same approach
was adopted for rearing the vector of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’, C. pruni (Jarausch and

70 B. Jarausch et al. Jarausch 2016). These studies confirmed that both psyllid species are univoltine and
cannot reproduce on conifers. A further rearing approach for C. pruni was applied by Thébaud et al. (2008)
using sleeve cages on healthy or infected Prunus plants. Thébaud et al. (2009) found
C. pruni on Picea abies at an altitude of 1260 m a.s.1. and were able to overwinter
them in sleeve cages on these conifers but survival rates ranged only between 1.2
and 8.9%. Using a similar approach, Pizzinat et al. (2011) could hibernate C. mela-
noneura in branch cages on different coniferous species at an altitude between 1442
and 1636 ma.s.]. in Northwestern Italy. 3.8 Multitrophic Interaction

The secret language of the earth’s ecosystem involves a multitude of players that
populate the playing field and occupy different rungs on the food chain (Wartenberg
2016; Gross 2016; Sauvion et al. 2017). The actors include plants, plant feeding
i sect feeding insects, plant parasites, insect parasites, pathogenic and ben-
eficial microorganisms, vectoring organisms, pollinators, and more (Gross 2016:
Corcket et al. 2017; Kaiser et al. 2017; Giron et al. 2017). Thus, fundamental
research on the biology and ecology including chemically mediated multitrophic
interactions of vectoring psyllids is needed for understanding vector epidemiology,
plant pathogen transmission and for developing appropriate and sustainable control
measures of vectors and pathogens (Gross 2016). The natural enemies of phloem-feeding insects (predators, parasitoids, or ento-
mopathogens) may have large effects on speciation, community composition and
ecosystem processes (Elzinga et al. 2007). Hence, these plant-pathogen—vector sy:
tems are of particular interest, in which a transmitted pathogen infects both, its host
plant and vector insect, because pathogens and their differing hosts (plant and
insect) must develop co-adapted strategies to avoid deleterious effects of each other
(Gross 2016). In general, the pattern of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released
from plant modules (leaves and flowers) can change both quantitatively and quali-
tatively with abiotic (e.g. warming, drought) and biotic stressors (e.g. herbivore
feeding, pathogen infection). The role of allelochemicals for psyllid behavior and the influence of phytoplasma
infections on volatile production of psyllid host plants were studied during the last
12 years (Gross 2016). For identifying their particular host plants for feeding and
reproduction, volatile signals are used in many species during migration (Gross and
Mekonen 2005; Mayer et al. 2008a, 2008b, 2009; Soroker et al. 2004; Weintraub
and Gross 2013). Also non-volatile phloem/xylem components influence host
choice and maybe oviposition behaviour (Mayer et al. 2011). By analysing the
VOCs emitted by the leaves of apple trees, it was shown that ‘Ca. P. mali’ changed
the odour of infected trees compared to healthy ones (Mayer et al. 2008a). In pear
trees infected with ‘Ca. P. pyri’, the expression of ethylbenzoate differed significantly
between infected and healthy trees. The virulence of different strains of ‘Ca. P.

mali’ was proven to influence the pattern of produced volatiles in the model plant
tobacco as well as in apple trees both quantitatively and qualitatively (Rid et al. 2016). The influence of volatiles on the interactions between the pathogen ‘Ca. P.
mali’, the host plants for reproduction (apple trees) and overwintering (conifers) of
its vector C. picta and the proposed epidemiology of ‘Ca. P. mali’ is the most stud-
ied so far: C. picta reproduces on apple and new adults emerge at phenology stages
69-71 (late blossom, early fruit development) of the apple plant. These emigrants
are attracted by f-caryophyllene (Mayer et al. 2008b), which is mainly produced by
infected apples during this time (Mayer et al. 2008a), and both males and females
are lured to infected plants (J. Gross, unpublished data), increasing the number of
psyllids, which are able to acquire the phytoplasma. Witches’ broom produced
exclusively by infected plants increase their leaf surface and may support the emis-
sion of volatile B-caryophyllene (Mayer et al. 2011). Shortly after feeding on apple,
the adults emigrate to conifers where they stay until spring (Mayer and Gross 2007). After overwintering, the psyllids return to apple trees (remigrants), but now prefer
to lay their eggs on uninfected plants, which increases the opportunity to transmit
the phytoplasma (Mayer et al. 2011). Which signals may regulate this egg-laying
behaviour still remains unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. By develop-
ing on apple plants infected by ‘Ca. P. mali’, the nymphs of C. picta suffered higher
mortality and remained smaller compared to the ontogenetic development on unin-
fected plants (Mayer et al. 2011). In contrast, infection by ‘Ca. P. mali’ was toler-
ated by adults and seems to have no detrimental effect. Thus, females of C. picta
evolved mechanisms to minimize harmful effects for their offspring emanated by
the phytoplasma by avoiding oviposition on infected plants. In this context it seems
possible that non-volatile signals from phloem sap could be involved in the psyllids’
final decision (J. Gross, unpublished data). This behavior ensures the development
of a new, vital vector generation, which is important for the spread of the phyto-
plasma. In conclusion, the complex multitrophic interactions between phytoplasma,
plant and vector may result i in both higher numbers of transmitting vector insects
and a very effective trans ion of the phytoplasma within the insect population. The outcome of the research on multitrophic interactions is the key for develop-
ing innovative and sustainable applications in phytomedicine. Besides intraspecific
active pheromones, also interspecific active allelochemicals such as -caryophyllene
or ethylbenzoate can be used as lures in traps. Different classes of infochemicals
(attractants, arrestants, and repellents) can be combined to attract-and-kill strate-
gies, push-and-pull or push-pull-kill strategies (Gross and Giindermann 2016). By
using allelochemicals instead of pheromones, the emission rates of the attractive
compounds, often plant produced kairomones, has to be multiple times higher than
by using pheromones, requiring new types of dispensers or microencapsulated info-
chemicals (Gross 2017). Signals triggering interactions between psyllids, phyto-
plasma and plants and within psyllid species are not restricted to volatile and
non-volatile infochemicals, as the existence of acoustic communication in courtship
behaviour of C. pyri has been shown recently (Eben et al. 2014). This may enable
innovative attempts for the control of C. pyri by extending push-and-pull strategies
to acoustic signals and including the use of both attractive chemical and acoustic

2017). Based on the results on multitrophic interactions the development of chemi-
cally lured traps for monitoring and mass trapping has recently started (Eben and
Gross 2013; Gross and Giindermann 2016). References
