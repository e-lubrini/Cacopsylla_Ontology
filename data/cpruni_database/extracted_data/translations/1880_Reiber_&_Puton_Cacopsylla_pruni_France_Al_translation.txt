OF

ALSACE AND LORRAINE. When we published in 1876 the Catalog des Hémip-
teres-Heteroptera of |'Alsace and Lorraine', we have
announced that it would be followed by the Homoptera who inhabit the same
region. It is this promise that we are carrying out today. The Homoptera are more difficult to study than the Hete-
ropters; this difficulty arises not only from their size
generally quite small and their specific characteristics often
little decided, but above all the lack of good works of des-
descriptive. The translation of Fieber's unpublished work on the Cicadines
of Europe 2 was not printed as quickly as we
Pavions expected: only two deliveries have appeared, the third

is in press. These delays are in no way due to the
fault of the translator, since the manuscript is translated and delivered
since a long time. The insects which are the subject of this work all live at the
think of plants, to which they sometimes cause damage
appreciable, when they develop in too great abundance. Their geographical circumscription, like that of the Heterop-
teres, is very extensive and it is to be presumed that one will find in
our region almost all the species that are part of the
fauna of central Europe. Today we list 302
species, but this number will be increased by the research that
our friends and us, we continue with ardor. Therefore
we already give a Supplement of 24 species & our list
Heteroptera which is thus increased to 518. Several of our Cicadines were still unedited; we have
obtained from the friendship of M. Lethierry, the entomologist who knows
the best Cicadines in France, the description of these species
and we insert them in notes as he transmitted them to us,

Mr. Bellevoye on his side has continued to enrich our Catalog
of his observations in the Messina region. We thank
cordially our two colleagues for their friendly collaboration. We also thank the entomologists of our region,
who kindly agreed, as for the Heteroptera, to
fuck the results of their research. Ferp. REIBER. Dr PUTON. HEMIPTERA - HOMOPTERA

vertex of variable color, sometimes entirely pale with a row
small brown transverse lines on each side of the forehead; sometimes the
vertex stained with brown, more strongly in front, and the completely black forehead,
with pale cheeks and clypeus, pale or black-spotted pronotum. Crest
pale with two spots on each side of the base, and sometimes a band
median longitudinal, black. Homeelytra with strong veins, white in
