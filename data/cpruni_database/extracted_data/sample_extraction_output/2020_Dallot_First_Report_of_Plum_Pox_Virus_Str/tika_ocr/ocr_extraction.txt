Sharka, caused by plum pox virus (PPV, genus Potyvirus), is

one of the most important Prunus diseases (Scholthof et al.

2011). Its worldwide presence includes almost all Eastern and

Central European countries (Rimbaud et al. 2015).

Surprisingly, there is still no official report of PPV presence in

the Republic of North Macedonia (previously: former

Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), despite the mention of

sharka on plum trees in old (Josifović 1964) and local (Mitrev

et al. 2012) documents and its official presence in the

surrounding countries (i.e., Albania, Serbia, Bulgaria, and

Greece [EPPO 2019]). In June 2018, we carried out a

countrywide survey targeting cultivated (commercial orchards

and private gardens), subspontaneous, and wild Prunus trees,

including P. persica, P. armeniaca, P. domestica, and P.

cerasifera. Leaf samples were collected from 173 trees

exhibiting typical (chlorotic rings and vein yellowing; 115

samples), atypical (necrotic spots; 29), or no (29) sharka

symptoms. In the absence of typical symptoms, PPV detection

was performed by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked

immunosorbent assay (Agdia, Elkhart, IN) followed, for all

positive samples, by immunocapture reverse transcription

polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) with the PPV-

polyvalent P10/P20 primers (Olmos et al. 2002). The samples

with typical sharka symptoms were directly subjected to IC-

RT-PCR. Strains were typed using strain-specific primers (CIP-

M/MR and CIP-D/DR, in combination with P3M/P4 and

P3D/P4), allowing the amplification of either PPV-M or PPV-D

genomic fragments in the (Cter)P3-6K1-(Nter)CI and (Cter)NIb-

(Nter)CP regions, respectively (Candresse et al. 1998;

Kamenova et al. 2011). Successful PCR amplifications with

CIP-D/DR and P3M/P4 primer pairs suggested the presence of

recombinant PPV-Rec. The mD5/mM3 primers spanning the

PPV-Rec recombination breakpoint (Šubr et al. 2004) were

used in a second step to identify PPV-Rec isolates and mixed-

strain infections. PPV was detected in 69% of the samples

(110, 8, and 1 samples with typical, atypical, and no sharka

symptoms, respectively), among which 88 were typed as PPV-

M (74%), 10 as PPV-D (8%), and 21 as PPV-Rec (18%). Mixed

infection (M+D) was detected in only one sample. To confirm

the strain typing, the genomic region consisting of the

(Cter)NIb, full CP, and 3’UTR (1,252 nt) was sequenced for nine

isolates typed as PPV-M (MK41, MK112, and MK175), -D

(MK52, MK61, and MK169), and -Rec (MK121, MK137, and

MK158). Each sequence was assembled from two overlapping

PCR fragments amplified (and directly sequenced) using

primer pairs P3M or P3D/P1, and P2 (Wetzel et al.

1991)/PolyT9 (5′-T GTCTCTTGC-3′), respectively. The

Macedonian isolates typed as PPV-M, -Rec, and -D showed the

highest nucleotide identities with PPV-M (98.7 to 99.3% with

either M92280 or AJ243957), PPV-Rec (99.3 to 99.4% with

HG964685), and PPV-D (98.2 to 99% with either HQ452356 or

LT600780) strains, respectively. Phylogenetic reconstruction

confirmed (with high support values) strain assignment. The

corresponding sequences were deposited in GenBank

(accession nos. MK562730 to MK562738). This is the first

official report of PPV in the Republic of North Macedonia,

where all sampled peach and plum orchards were infected.

This work bridges a knowledge gap in the distribution of this

quarantine pathogen, which induces up to 100% yield loss for

the most susceptible local plum cultivars (e.g., Požegača)

(Scholthof et al. 2011).
