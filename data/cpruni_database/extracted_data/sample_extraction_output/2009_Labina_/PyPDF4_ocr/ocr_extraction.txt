Abstract
ŠThe psyllid fauna of the relict steppes of Central Yakutia is studied for the first time. Among the six 
species examined, two are new for Yakutia.

The relict steppes are unique as a type of extrazonal 
vegetation, widely distributed in the territory of  

Yakutia as early as in the Pleistocene. At present, the 

largest pieces of steppe vegetation are preserved in the 

middle stream of the Lena River and in the basins of 

the rivers Yana and Indigirka (Ivanova and Perfil™eva, 

1972). 
Psyllids are one of the less studied insects in the Si-
berian fauna: until now, there has been no publication 

on the composition of the psyllid fauna of the region 

as the whole or of its isolated natural areas. The only 

exception is the paper on psyllids of the Republic of 

Altai by Labina (2008). 
Previously, 38 species of psyllids were recorded 
from Yakutia in different publications. The first data 

on psyllids appeared in papers by Loginova (1961, 

1963), dealing with the revision of the genera 

Aphalara
 Förster, 1848 and 
Craspedolepta
 Enderlein, 
1921 (Loginova, 1961, 1963), in the review on psyllids 

associated with 
Salix
 (Loginova, 1967), and also in 
publications where new psyllid species were described 

(Loginova 1962a, 1966). Several species were re-

corded from Yakutia in the faunal lists of other re-

gions: Leningrad Province (Loginova, 1962b) and the 

Caucasus (Loginova, 1968). In total, 17 species were 

mentioned from Yakutia by M. Loginova, including  

4 described from the material 
collected in the territory 
of the republic, with two of them, 
Aphalara sibirica 
Loginova, 1962 and 
Cacopsylla sibirica 
(Loginova, 
1966) being endemics to the area. Later on, Kli-

maszewski (1983) presented data on 10 psyllid species 

from Yakutia; 9 of them were recorded from this terri-

tory for the first time. In
 the later joint publication 
(Drohojowaska and Klimaszewski, 2006), one more 
species endemic to Yakutia, 
Psylla kotejai
 Droho-
jowaska et Klimaszewski, 2006 was described. 
Despite the fact that psyllid fauna of Yakutia is 
rather well studied as compared to other Siberian re-

gions, currently available data are far from being com-

plete, which is particularly confirmed by the present 

study. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The invertebrate fauna of relict steppe communities 
on the bedrock bank of the Lena River was studied in 

the summer of 2007. The present publication is based 

on material collected in model plots by A. Bagacha-

nova and Yu. Ermakova, res
earchers of the Laboratory 
of Systematics and Ecology of Invertebrates, Institute 

of Biological Problems of the Cryolithic Zone
,
 Sibe-
rian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences. Insects 

were collected by sweeping with a standard entomo-

logical net; material was kept in alcohol. A total of 

126 psyllids was examined. 
Up till now, there were no data on psyllid fauna of 
relict steppes in Central Yakutia. In the present work, 

six species belonging to the families Psyllidae and 

Triozidae are noted, with two of them, 
Bactericera 
curvatinervis
 (Förster, 1848) and
 B. rossica
 (Horváth, 
1901) (Triozidae), not recorded from Yakutia earlier.

 This species was collected 
by us in the piedmont of the steppe slope from grasses. 
However, the habitats of the species are rather diverse 
within its distribution range spreading from forest 

tundra to steppes: it was recorded from forests, out-

skirts, river banks, forest and flood-plain meadows, 

slopes with shrub thickets, 
edges of flowing marshes, 
and waysides.
