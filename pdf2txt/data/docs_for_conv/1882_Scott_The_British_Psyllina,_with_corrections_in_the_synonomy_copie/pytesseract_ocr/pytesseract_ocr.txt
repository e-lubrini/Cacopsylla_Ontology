and apex black ; the apical half of the tarsi black. Abdomen elongato-clavate, sub-
compressed, black above, beneath yellow, with the edges of the segments broadly
edged with dark testaceous, merging into black towards the apex ; basal segment
above smooth and shining for about two-thirds its length, the apical portion thickly
but slightly punctured, the sides parallel for about two-thirds, when it grows sud-
denly wider; second segment twice as long as wide, and about two-thirds longer
than the third segment. All clothed with a short whitish pile. Ovipositor testa-
ceous, curved, about one millimétre in length.

I have four specimens of this species : I captured two by sweeping
vetches in a field near Exeter, in June, 1881, the others I bred from
a hedge at Lydford, on the border of Dartmoor. The description
applies to both sexes, as do also the measurements.

This insect in general appearance and colouring might, at first
sight, be taken for a a small specimen of Gravenhorst’s Campoplex
viennensis ; according to this author’s arrangement, it would come
in his second section, but naturally it would seem to be nearly allied to
C. viennensis, on which account I have named it afinis.

THE BRITISH PSYLLINA, WITH CORRECTIONS IN THE SYNONYMY.

BY JOHN scorT?,

Some attention being now given to this interesting group by
several studeats, perhaps it will not be out of place for me to lay
before them a complete list of the genera and species found in the
British Islands down to the present time, together with such corrections
in the synonymy as have been made since the publication of my
Monograph in the Trans. Ent. Soc. for 1876. From the time of the
appearance of Dr, Férster's Monograph, in 1848, until lately, no
attempt was made to alter or interfere with his arrangement generi-
cally or otherwise: probably, this may have arisen from a paucity of
observers. In 1877, however, Prof. C. G. Thomson, in his “ Opuscula
Entomologiea,” fasciculus, 8, gave a Synopsis of the Scandinavian
species, under the title of “Ofversigt af Skandinaviens Chermes-arter,”
wherein he desires to restore the name Chermes, originally given to
some of them by Linné; no one, however, of late days has adopted it
except Thomson, and whether he will have many followers remains to
be seen, His further innovations as regards sections of the genera
employed by Férster point in the right direction, and with respect
to Trioza Watkeri, which he makes the type of a sub-genus, Zricho-
psylla, 1 would go further and give it generic rank ; the structural dif-

ferences of the elytra alone being a sufficient reason for doing this.
Next, Dr. Franz Low, in his “ Systematik der Psylloden,” published
in the “ Verh. z.-b. Ges.,” xxviii, pp. 605—609, divided the group into
sub-families, and assigned to each division various genera, which are
justifiable by the structural characters he points out; thus reducing
the whole family into small groups easy of recognition.

The following list, prepared mostly in accordance with Dr, Low’s
views, contains all the additions made to the British species since
the publication of my Monograph. His sub-families are four in
number, viz. :—Liviine, Aphalarine, Psylline, and Triozine.

form of the processes in Ps. pyri ‘at once settles the question, yet we are left in doubt whether

I may add that I do not hold with Dr. F. Léw in the position he
assigns to the genera Livilla and Spanionewra in his sub-family
Psylling. Although the neuration of the elytra of the former is

 

256 (Am,

similar to that of Psylla, yet the peculiarity of the form and length
of the face-lobes seem to indicate that it ought to be dealt with as a
member of a sub-family, to be called Livilline. As for the latter
(Spanioneura), it is somewhat remarkable in its structure, partaking,
as it does, of the characters of Psylla and Trioze combined. From
Pesylia it differs in having lanceolate elytra, as in Trioza; and from
Trioza in haying a petiolate cubitus, as in Psylla. Here, also, I think
are sufficient grounds for the formation of a new sub-family, under

the name of Spanioneurine.

In the “ Meddel. af Soc. pro Fauna et Flora fennica,” 5 (1880),
Dr. O. M. Reuter, in his enumeration of the Hemiptera of Abo and
Aland, observes the nomenclature of Dr. Low in respect of the Psyllina,

which are mostly the same species as in Britain.

ENTOMOLOGICAL NOTES FROM TENERIFFE, ST. VINCENT, &c.

BY GERVASE F. MATHEW, R.N., F.LS., F.Z.S., &c.

We arrived at Teneriffe on the 17th December, and on the fol-
lowing afternoon I went for a walk, taking the road from Santa Cruz
towards Laguna, in the interior, the ancient capital of the island. The
country passed through was very rough, dry, and rocky, the small
fields being divided by loose stone walls, reminding one of Malta. The
only things under cultivation, at this time of the year, appear to be
spring onions and prickly pears. There were a great many acres of
the latter, which are grown for the purpose of rearing the cochineal
insect. In one place there were a number of women busily engaged
covering the leaves with muslin. The parent insects, so I was told,
are kept in sheds, built for the purpose, and deposit their ova on the
muslin, which is then eut into pieces about six inches square. These
pieces are then wrapped round a leaf of the prickly pear, and their
ends fastened to the leaf with the sharp thorns picked from the plant
itself. The little creatures when they are hatched crawl from the
muslin on to the leaf, and the muslin afterwards serves as a protection
from wind and rain. The insects take three or four months coming
to maturity, when they are shaken off, baked, aud dried, and are then
ready for exportation. There are two “crops” in the year, but the
first is generally a light one.
