Abstract. Results of the investigation into jumping plant-lice (Hemiptera, Psylloidea) of Lithuania based
on samples collected during 2007 and 2008 are presented. In this study, six species of Psyllidae and four
species of Triozidae were detected; nine of the species were recorded from Lithuania for the first time. Key words: Psylloidea, jumping plant-lice, Lithuania, first records

INTRODUCTION

Jumping plant-lice (Hemiptera, Psylloidea) feed on the
phloem sap of plants, mostly dicotyledons. The group
contains many economically important pest species. Three species have been reported to be horticultural or
agricultural pests in Lithuania (Vengeliauskaité 1974):
Cacopsylla mali (Schmidberger) and C. pyri (Linnaeus)
are common and widespread pests in apple and pear
orchards respectively; and Zrioza apicalis Foerster is
an occasional pest of carrots grown in gardens located
near coniferous forests. These are apparently the only
species of jumping plant-lice recorded for Lithuania so
far. Ossiannilsson (1992) studied jumping plant-lice of
Fennoscandia and Denmark, and also mentioned spe-
cies found in the Baltic countries (Estonia and Latvia),
but none of the species were specifically recorded for
Lithuania. Neither the list of Psylloidea of the European
part of the former USSR (Gegechkori & Loginova 1990)
nor the online database of the European fauna (Burck-
hardt 2007) contains specific records for Lithuania. The present study provides recent records of jumping
plant-lice for Lithuania. MATrERIAL AND METHODS

Samples of jumping plant-lice were collected by the
first two authors on woody and herbaceous plants
mainly during 17-23 June 2007 and 21-30 July 2008;
and from water traps (Flora Insect Traps, Nickerson
Brothers Ltd., UK, | litre) placed in potato (Solanum
tuberosum L.) fields in Klaipéda county during 2007 and
2008. Adults and larvae were slide-mounted according

to methods published in works by Malumphy (2005)
and identified using the diagnostic keys provided by
Hodkinson and White (1979), Ossiannilsson (1992)
also White and Hodkinson (1982). Slide-mounted
specimens were deposited at the following institutes:
Central Science Laboratory (CSL) (Sand Hutton, UK)
and the Phytosanitary Research Laboratory (Vilnius,
Lithuania). The nomenclature for jumping plant-lice
follows Ossiannilsson (1992). The host and distribution
data presented below were also obtained from Ossian-
nilsson (1992). RESULTS

Ten species belonging to two families were recorded
during the present study. Psyllidae

Pasvalys, Siauliai, Vilnius, Kaunas districts, where in
favourable years the insect occurred at high densities and
damaged up to 59% of blossoms (Vengeliauskaité 1974). Later Raudonis and ValiuSkaité (2001) reported its oc-
currence in more than half of apple orchards at low,
non-damaging levels. Collection data: all samples consisted of abundant adults

Ten species of jumping plant-lice were collected by
the authors in Lithuania during 2007 and 2008, nine
of which were recorded from the country for the first
time. This brings the total number of Psylloidea re-

corded for Lithuania to 12, which is collated with 84
species recorded for Fennoscandia and Denmark by
Ossiannilsson (1992) and 104 for neighbouring Poland
(Burckhardt 2007). There is no doubt that the fauna
of Lithuania is studied inadequately and perhaps 70
or more species are still awaiting detection. National
checklists provide essential baseline data, from which
faunistic changes, due to such factors as international
trade and climate change, can be monitored and accu-
rately assessed. This is particularly relevant to jumping
plant-lice as several species are successful invasive
colonisers. For example, approximately a fifth of the
species present in Britain are of exotic origin and at
least nine species have been introduced into Europe and
have become naturalised since the 1970s. Two of these
exotic species may be of concern to Lithuania: Cacop-
sylla fulguralis (Kuwayama) on Elaeagnus and Trioza
vitreoradiata (Maskell) on Pittosporum. C. fulguralis
originates in Asia and was introduced into Britain and
France in about 1999 (Malumphy & Halstead 2003). It
is spreading rapidly throughout England and has also
been reported from Belgium (Baugnee 2003) and Italy
(Siiss & Savoldelli 2003). 7. vitreoradiata originates
in New Zealand and was introduced into Britain in the
1990s (Martin & Malumphy 1995). It is naturalised in
western parts of England and Scotland and has been
reported from France (Cocquempot 2008) and Ireland
(O’Connor et al. 2004). ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
