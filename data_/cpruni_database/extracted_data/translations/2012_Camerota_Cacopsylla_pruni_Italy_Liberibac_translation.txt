Abstract Psyllids, as vectors of phloem-restricted
plant pathogens, are serious agricultural pests. Fruit
tree phytoplasmas are transmitted by different Cacop-
sylla spp., while other psyllids are known vectors of
liberibacters. Recently, the bacterium ‘Candidatus

Liberibacter europaeus’ was found in pear trees and
in Cacopsylla pyri (Linnaeus), the vector of ‘Ca. Phy-
toplasma pyri’. This new species does not cause symp-
toms in plants and is probably a symbiont rather than a
pathogen. Based on these findings and the assumption
that ‘Ca. Liberibacter europaeus’ is widespread, we
studied its distribution in the genus Cacopsylla and in
the respective host and shelter plants (where psyllids
aestivate and overwinter), as well as its possible co-
presence with ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ spp. We tested 14
Cacopsylla species and 11 plant species from north-
western Italy, Hungary and Israel, characterized by
warm oceanic, temperate continental and warm Medi-
terranean climatic conditions, respectively. ‘Ca. Liberi-
bacter europaeus’ was common within the Cacopsylla
genus, being present in nine of the 14 species screened
as well as in most host plants, whereas none of the
shelter plants tested positive for this bacterium. Alto-
gether, these findings indicate the presence of ‘Ca. Liberibacter europaeus’ in continental zones, whereas
it does not seem to be widespread in the Mediterranean
region. Furthermore, lack of specific symptoms in all
infected plants confirms an endophytic relationship with
this bacterium, while its abundance in insects suggests a
beneficial role for the host. Co-infections with phyto-
plasmas, observed in insects and plants, require further
study to evaluate the possible interactions between
them. ® Springer

Introduction

As vectors of phytopathogenic agents, many psyllids
represent important pests of agricultural crops. The
main plant pathogens associated with and transmitted
by psyllids are viruses, such as the Potato rugose
stunting virus (Tenorio et al. 2003), and bacteria such
as ‘Candidatus Liberibacter’ spp. and ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma’ spp. (Hodkinson 2009). In the last few
years, researchers have focused their interest on ‘Ca. Liberibacter’ spp. because of the serious economic
losses they cause worldwide. The genus ‘Ca. Liberi-
bacter’ includes phloem-limited Gram-negative bacteria
belonging to the «-subdivision of the Proteobacteria
(Jagoueix et al. 1994). To date, five species have been
identified: Huanglongbing (HLB) disease, also known
as citrus greening, is associated with ‘Ca. Liberibacter
asiaticus’, ‘Ca. Liberibacter americanus’ and ‘Ca. Lib-
eribacter africanus’ and affects many citrus cultivars, as
well as wild citrus. ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’
is present in Asia and America. ‘Ca. Liberibacter amer-
icanus’ is common in the Americas, and ‘Ca. Liberi-
bacter africanus’ occurs in Africa (Gottwald 2010; Lin
1956; McLean and Oberholz 1965; Teixeira et al. 2005). ‘Ca. Liberibacter solanacearum’, also known as ‘Ca. Liberibacter psyllaurous’, is associated with newly
emerging and economically important diseases of
solanaceous crops. ‘Ca. Liberibacter solanacearum’
is present in New Zealand (Liefting e¢ al, 2008) and the
Americas (Hansen et al. 2008; Munyaneza et al. 2009;
Wen et al. 2009), and it was recently observed in Europe
in carrots (Munyaneza ef al, 2010). A new species
described in Europe, ‘Ca. Liberibacter europaeus’
(hereafter referred to as CLeu), infects Cacopsylla
pyri (Linnaeus) and pear plants. However, even
though the percentage of plants hosting CLeu
was quite high, no specific symptoms were
observed in infected pears, leading to the proposal
that this bacterium behaves as an endophyte rather
than a pathogen (Raddadi ef al. 2011). Further-
more, studies of CLeu in C. pyri revealed high
infection rates (Raddadi ef al. 2011), suggesting
that this bacterium has an endosymbiotic relationship
with the insect, as suggested for other Liberibacter
species (Duan et al. 2009). D Springer

To date, CLeu has been described only in pears and
pear psyllids in northwestern Italy; however, there are
no reported investigations into its occurrence in other
European and Mediterranean regions, or in other
plants or psyllid species. If the nature of the interaction
of CLeu with both insects and plants is beneficial, it is
likely to have a much wider distribution than that
known today. Moreover, considering the fact that C.
pyri and other species of the genus Cacopsylla are
known vectors of phytoplasmas (Carraro et al. 1998a,b, 2004; Davies et al. 1992; Jarausch et al. 2003; Tedeschi and Alma 2004), possible interactions
may have developed between these two microorgan-
isms in both plants and insects. The aim of this work was to investigate whether
CLeu is capable of infecting different species of the
genus Cacopsylla and their respective host and shelter
plants, and to evaluate the spread of the bacterium in the
species under investigation. Samples were collected in
three different geographical areas: northwestern Italy
(Piedmont and Aosta Valley), Central Hungary (Pest
County) and Israel (the Galilee region), which are char-
acterized by different climatic conditions. Indeed,
according to the Képpen-Geiger classification, the
Piedmont region falls into climate type Cfa (warm oce-
anic), Aosta Valley and Pest have climate type Dfb
(temperate continental), and the Galilee is classified as
climate type Csa (warm Mediterranean) (Peel et al. 2007). In addition, we investigated the possible co-
presence of CLeu and phytoplasmas. Materials and methods

Insect sampling, species determination and DNA
isolation In northwestern Italy, sampling was carried
out in eight different locales in the Piedmont and
Aosta Valley regions at altitudes between 500 and
1500 m above sea level (masl) from February until
November in the years 2008-2010. Insects were col-
lected from Pyrus communis L. (pear), Malus domes-
tica (Borkh.) (apple), Crataegus monogyna (Jacquin)
(hawthorn), Prunus spinosa (L.) (blackthorn), Prunus
domestica (L.) (plum) and Salix caprea (L.) (goat
willow) using the beat-tray method, and from Abies
alba (Miller) (silver fir), Picea abies (L.) (Norway
spruce), Larix decidua (Miller) (European larch) and
Pinus sylvestris (L.) (Scots pine) by means of a sweep
net (35 cm diam) with a 5-m telescopic handle

(Cermak and Lauterer 2008). For the beat-tray meth-
od, also called ‘frappage’, a white plastic tray (250
350 mm) was held beneath the tree branches and the
branches were struck several times to dislodge insects
into the tray. The psyllids were then collected in glass
tubes by means of a mouth aspirator and brought to the
laboratory for further analyses (Horton 1994; Tedeschi
et al. 2002). The species Cacopsylla pyrisuga (Forster), Cacop-
sylla pyricola (Forster), Cacopsylla peregrina
(Forster), Cacopsylla crataegi (Schrank), Cacopsylla
nigrita (Zetterstedt), Cacopsylla breviantennata
(Flor), Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli) and Cacopsylla
ambigua (Forster) were identified by examining the
forewings and male and female terminalia (Ossiannilsson
1992). Cacopsylla melanoneura (Férster) and Cacop-
sylla affinis (L6w) were also collected. Due to the fact
that these latter two species live together on Crataegus
spp., migrate to conifers as shelter plants for aestivation
and overwintering and have similar morphological char-
acters, all Cacopsylla spp. specimens collected on haw-
thom plants or conifers were identified by means of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses using
species-specific primers. All of the insects were stored
in absolute ethanol at -20°C before analysis. Cacopsylla melanoneura, C. peregrina, C. affinis
and C. crataegi were collected on hawthorn in the
Aosta Valley region; C. melanoneura was also sam-
pled in apple orchards and from Norway spruce, Scots
pine and European larch plants. In the same region, C.
nigrita was found on Norway spruce, Scots pine,
silver fir and European larch, while C. ambigua and
C. breviantennata were collected from goat willow
and Norway spruce, respectively. The species C. pyr-
icola and C. pyrisuga were found in pear orchards in
Piedmont. In Hungary, the samplings were carried out in pear
orchards from two sites in Pest County between May
and July 2011 at altitudes between 110 and 149 masl. Specimens of C. pyri, C. pyricola and C. pyrisuga
were collected using the beat-tray method and were
identified by examining the forewings and male and
female terminalia. In Israel, the samplings were carried out in April
2010 in two different locales in the Upper Galilee
region at altitudes between 700 and 1000 masl. The
following species of the genus Cacopsylla were col-
lected from different plants using the beat-tray meth-
od: Cacopsylla bidens (Sule) from Pyrus syriaca

(Boiss.) (wild pear), Cacopsylla myrthi (Puton) from
Rhamnus alaternus (L.) (Mediterranean buckthorn)
and Cacopsylla pulchella (Low) from Cercis siliquas-
trum (L.) (Judas tree). The species were identified by
examining the forewings and male and female
terminalia. The SDS-proteinase K-CTAB protocol (Sambrook
et al. 1989), modified as reported previously (Raddadi
et al. 2011), was used to extract DNA samples from
single individuals of all psyllid species. Plant sampling and DNA isolation The following
plant species were sampled at the sites at which their
respective psyllids were sampled: pear (41 samples),
apple (20 samples), hawthorn (18 samples), plum
(9 samples), blackthorn (10 samples), goat willow
(5 samples), wild pear (3 samples), silver fir (8 sam-
ples), Norway spruce (8 samples), Scots pine (3 sam-
ples), European larch (3 samples). Because symptoms
for CLeu have never been observed or described,
secondary and tertiary branches from plants with or
without symptoms of phytoplasma infection were
randomly collected. Total DNA was extracted from 100 mg (wet
weight) plant phloem tissues that had been ground
with liquid nitrogen in a sterile mortar, according to
the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit protocol (Qiagen; Milan,
Italy). The DNA was eluted in 100 11 of elution buffer
and kept at —20°C before use. PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) analyses To discriminate between C. melano-
neura and C. affinis, which cannot be distinguished
based on morphological characteristics, the two primer
pairs MEL_fw/MEL_rev and AFF_fw/AFF_rev were
used in a duplex touch-down PCR according to
Tedeschi and Nardi (2010). The reaction and cycling
conditions were as described in the original paper. Each amplicon (5 11) was separated by electrophoresis
in a 1% agarose gel and the PCR products were
visualized using a transilluminator after staining with
ethidium bromide. To verify the incidence of CLeu in psyllids and
plants, heminested PCR of the 16S rRNA gene was
performed using the specific primers Lib223F and
Lib451R, as reported previously (Raddadi ef al. 2011). To assess the presence of phytoplasmas in psyllids
that feed on fruit trees and in their host/shelter plants,
PCR assays were carried out with universal phytoplasma

nested PCR with specific primers for the 16SrX group
phytoplasmas, fO1 and rO1 (Lorenz et al, 1995). The
cycling and reaction conditions were as described in the
original papers. Amplicons were then subjected to RFLP. analyses with the restriction enzymes SspI (Fermentas;
Vilnius, Lithuania) and RsaI (Promega; Madison, WI,
USA), following the suppliers’ instructions, to determine
the 16SrX subgroup (Seemiiller and Schneider 2004). For all of the other psyllids and their respective host/
shelter plants, PCR assays were carried out with the
universal phytoplasma primers P1/P7 followed by a
nested PCR with the other universal phytoplasma primer
pair F2n/R2 (Gundersen and Lee 1996). Reaction and
cycling conditions were the same as in the original paper. Results

Incidence of CLeu in psyllids and plants A total of
421 specimens belonging to 14 different species of the
Psylloidea superfamily were screened for the presence

of CLeu (Table 1). Of these, 72 were positive for
CLeu, corresponding to 17.1% of the individuals
analyzed, whereas 20 out of 421 samples were found
to be infected by ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ spp., corresponding
to 4.75% of the individuals analyzed. CLeu was detected in nine species of the genus
Cacopsylla and in four species of host plants, includ-
ing apple (the host plant of C. melanoneura), black-
thorn (the host plant of C. pruni), hawthorn (the host
plant of both C. melanoneura and C. peregrina), and
pear (the host plant of C. pyri, C. pyricola and C.
pyrisuga). With regard to geographical distribution,
CLeu was found in 67 out of 364 (18.4%) specimens
collected in Italy, in five out of 28 (17.9%) Hungarian
individuals, and in none of the 46 Israeli psyllids. CLeu was found in overwintered C. melanoneura
adults collected from both apple and hawthorn plants
and in newly emerged adults collected from apple
plants; it was never found in specimens collected from
conifers. Of the other psyllids collected from hawthorn
plants, 11.1% of the C. peregrina and 14.3% of the C.
affinis specimens analyzed were positive for CLeu,
whereas C. crataegi was always negative for the

presence of the bacterium. In Cacopsylla sp. adults
aestivating and overwintering on conifers, CLeu was
identified in three out of 15C. nigrita and in four out
of 20C. breviantennata specimens. The «-Proteobacterium was detected in three of the
four pear-feeding species: C. pyri, C. pyricola and C.
pyrisuga, with a high infection rate in the last (85.7%),
and in one specimen of the willow feeder C. ambigua. Its presence was not detected in C. crataegi, C. pruni,
C. pulchella or C. myrthi. Analysis of the host and shelter plants revealed the
presence of CLeu on apple and pear trees, but not on
plum, and among the wild plants, on blackthorn and
hawthorn. The bacterium was not found on goat wil-
low or on coniferous plants (Table 2). The PCR analyses using the 16SrX group-specific
primers fO1/rO1 followed by RFLP with the restric-
tion enzymes SspI and Rsal detected ‘Ca. Phyto-
plasma mali’ on apple and hawthorn plants from
Italy and Hungary, ‘Ca. Phytoplasma pyri’ on pear
plants from Italy and Hungary, and ‘Ca. Phytoplasma
prunorum’ on plum and blackthorn from Italy. Symptoms such as witches’ broom, leaf yellowing/
reddening and stunting were always matched to the
presence of phytoplasmas, whereas no particular
symptom was observed in the case of only CLeu
infection. Mixed infections of liberibacter/phyto-
plasma were observed in apple, pear, hawthorn and
blackthorn; however, we did not detect any difference
in observable symptoms of doubly infected and
phytoplasma-infected plants. Goat willow and all of the coniferous plants tested
were consistently free of phytoplasmas and CLeu. Discussion

The results suggest that CLeu is widespread through-
out European areas characterized by oceanic and con-
tinental climate types. This corroborates preliminary
observations made in northwestern Italy, where the o-
Proteobacterium was found in the oceanic and conti-
nental climates of the Piedmont and Aosta Valley
regions, respectively (Raddadi et al. 2011). Moreover,
this is the first report of CLeu in Hungary, confirming
this bacterium’s ability to spread in continental cli-
mates. On the other hand, we did not detect any CLeu
infections in Israel. There are a variety of possible
reasons for this, including the different climate, the

D Springer

presence of different host plants for many of the psyl-
lid species tested (for instance, plants that do not
belong to the Rosaceae family could be unsuitable
for the development of CLeu), the possibility that the
bacterium has simply not yet arrived, or the relatively
low number of samples tested. Further studies are
needed to exclude the presence of CLeu in this area,
and clarify its spread throughout different Mediterra-
nean regions. CLeu was detected in all insect species analyzed in
both Italy and Hungary except C. crataegi - although
in this case very few individuals were tested - and C.
pruni. This suggests that, at least in oceanic and con-
tinental areas within Europe, this bacterium is wide-
spread within the Cacopsylla genus. Similarly, CLeu
was present in all of the host plants of these species
except for plum. However, we know that the principal
host plant of C. pruni is blackthorn, whereas plum is
only sporadically colonized by this insect (Jarausch
et al. 2007). The occurrence of CLeu in blackthorn
indicates that C. pruni can be exposed to CLeu,
although the uptake rate is likely relatively low. In contrast, CLeu was never found in conifers or
goat willow. This could be due to the dissimilar com-
positions of these plants’ phloem sap: whereas in most
plants, conifers included, sucrose is the predominant
component of phloem sap, in Rosaceae plants the
sugar alcohol sorbitol is the main carbohydrate in the
phloem (Zimmerman and Ziegler 1975). The presence
of high concentrations of sorbitol may influence the
presence and development of CLeu, creating a suitable
environment. Very little information is available on the
phloem composition of Rutaceae and Solanaceae
plants, so it is difficult to compare the spread of CLeu
and other ‘Ca. Liberibacter’ spp. in relation to host
plant characteristics. Further work is required to clar-
ify this aspect. Note, also, that sampling limitations
might obscure other factors with a potential influence
on the failure to detect CLeu in conifers and goat
willow: the bacterium could have been absent on the
collected branches but present in other plant parts. Indeed, the uneven distribution of liberibacters in
plants is well known (Tatineni ef al, 2008; Teixeira
et al. 2008a; Wen et al. 2009). In addition, the limited
number of sampled trees leads to a smaller chance of
encountering an infected host, especially when infec-
tion rates are low. Similarly, phytoplasmas could not be detected in
any of the conifer samples. As infections by a group

16SrXXI phytoplasma have been reported in Pinus
spp. and other conifers (Kamiiska et al. 2011;
Schneider ef al. 2005), further research might reveal
the occurrence of phytoplasma-infected conifers in
northwestern Italy. In most of the insect species tested, we observed
high infection rates of CLeu which, in the case of C.
pyrisuga, were higher than the percentages observed
in Florida, USA (8.7%) and Indonesia (45.2%) for
Diaphorina citri with ‘Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus’
(Manjunath et al, 2008; Subandiyah et al. 2000). Such
a high infection rate supports a hypothesis of CLeu’s
role in the insect host as a beneficial symbiont, similar
to ‘Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus’ in Diaphorina citri,
whose role as a beneficial symbiont rather than a
simple ingested bacterium passing through the gut
was suggested by analysis of the bacterium’s genome
content (Duan et al. 2009). However, for the most
part, the interaction between liberibacters and their
hosts remains unclear. In Bactericera cockerelli
(Sule), for instance, ‘Ca. L. solanacearum’ has been
reported to have a negative effect on its vector’s pop-
ulation growth rate on tomato (Nachappa et al. 2012). CLeu was found in aestivating, overwintering and
newly emerged adults of monovoltine species, and in
winter- and summer-form adults of polyvoltine spe-
cies. It would be interesting to determine whether
psyllids on shelter plants retain the bacterium during
aestivation and overwintering. No CLeu could be
detected in C. melanoneura specimens collected from
conifers, but in C. nigrita and C. breviantennata, with
Salix spp. and Sorbus spp. as their respective host
plants, some CLeu-positive individuals were recorded
on conifers. Considering the fact that the conifer plants
themselves were always negative for these species, it
is possible that these psyllids retained a level of infec-
tivity from previous feeding activity on host plants,
although further studies should be carried out to spec-
ify the origin of infection in these Cacopsylla species
and the presence of this bacterium on different host
plant species. Preliminary transmission trials have demonstrated
C. pyri’s ability to transmit CLeu to healthy pear
plants (Raddadi ef al. 2011). The finding of this bac-
terium in a high number of Cacopsylla species and on
their respective host plants calls for verification of all
of these spi transmission abilities. Their possible
role as vectors will have a great influence on the
spread of this bacterium. Considering the fact that so far, symptoms related
to CLeu have never been observed on infected plants,
we cannot consider this liberibacter a plant pathogen,
in agreement with previous observations by Raddadi
et al. (2011). In our study we found mixed infections of CLeu
and 16SrX group phytoplasmas in psyllids and plants. The consequences of this co-presence on the insect
host’s fitness remain to be determined. On the other
hand, mixed infections were found in both symptom-
atic and asymptomatic plants, but we were not able to
find any correlation between the co-infection and phy-
toplasma symptom expression (data not shown). The
simultaneous presence of ‘Ca. Liberibacter’ spp. and
group 16SrIX and 16SrlI phytoplasmas has also been
observed on citrus plants, but not in the insect vectors
(Chen et al. 2009; Teixeira et al. 2008b), and there
was no particular influence on symptom severity. The
interactions between these bacteria in insects and
plants thus warrant further investigation. Acknowledgments We are grateful to the local authorities that
