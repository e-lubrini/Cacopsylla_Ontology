The same phytoplasmas were identified also in Phi- laenus spumarius samples collected in yellow sticky traps located inside the plum orchards. \u2018Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019  was detected in one declining cherry plant and in samples of Fieberiella florii. Among the insect species tested for phytoplasma  presence Cacopsylla pruni was only captured once, and the sample resulted negative to the molecular tests.  Key words: Cherry decline, PCR/RFLP analyses, insects, epidemiology.  Introduction  Vignola is one of the most important plum and cherry  growing areas in northern Italy. From the early thirties  a disease called \u201cleptonecrosis\u201d affecting plum, cherry  and apricot (Goidanich, 1933; 1934) was reported in the  area. This disease now named European stone fruit yel- lows (ESFY) is associated with \u2018Candidatus Phyto- plasma prunorum\u2019 (Seem\u00fcller and Schneider, 2004).  Severe outbreaks were observed over the years, mainly  after Japanese plum varieties were introduced into the  area. Recently, two experimental plum orchards where  tolerance/resistance to ESFY phytoplasma is studied  were monitored. Surveys were extended to verify phy- toplasma presence also in cherry plants growing nearby.  Symptomatic cherry plants, about 10 year\u2019s old, showed  poor vegetation, reduced leaf size, upward curled leaves  with discolorations ranging from yellow to red. Insects  collected on yellow sticky traps located in the experi- mental plum orchards were also tested in order to verify  phytoplasma presence in the environment.  Materials and methods  Leaf and small branch samples were collected from six  cherry plants (3 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic) near  the experimental plum fields. A total of 12 samples  were employed for nucleic acid extraction using a chlo- roform/phenol method (Prince et al., 1993).  During 2005-2006 insect monitoring was carried out  from March to the end of July with yellow sticky traps  randomly distributed in the two experimental plum or- chards. Insects collected from traps were maintained in  alcohol 100% at 4 \u00b0C for classification; nucleic acid ex- traction from interesting species was then carried out  with a rapid CTAB-based procedure (Angelini et al.,  2001) on batches of 3 insects per species.  Direct PCR with P1/P7 primer pair (Deng and Hiruki,  1991; Schneider et al., 1995) and nested amplification  with primers R16F2/R2 and/or R16(X)F1/R1 (Lee et  al., 1995) were performed on both plant and insect sam- ples following a described protocol (Schaff et al., 1992).  Reference phytoplasma strains were employed as posi- tive controls. Amplicons obtained with R16F2/R2 and  R16(X)F1/R1 primer pairs were subjected to RFLP  analyses with TruI, RsaI and SspI restriction enzymes to  verify phytoplasma identity.  Results and discussion  Only samples from both phloem and leaf midribs of  symptomatic cherry plants gave positive results in  nested PCR amplifications. RFLP analyses indicate the  presence of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in one of the trees and of  phytoplasmas belonging to ribosomal subgroup 16SrIII- A in the other two symptomatic cherry plants (figure 1).  Several potentially phytoplasma vectors were captured  in yellow sticky traps (table 1). Cacopsylla pruni Sco- poli, vector of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 (Carraro et al., 1998)  was only captured once and was negative to molecular  tests. Nested PCR amplification detected phytoplasma  presence in 4 out of the 6 species tested. RFLP analyses  with TruI showed restriction profiles of phytoplasmas  related to ribosomal group 16SrV (Elm yellows) in  Anoplotettix spp. and Metcalfa pruinosa Say. Ribosomal  group 16SrX (Apple proliferation) and subgroup  16SrIII-A (Peach X disease) were respectively detected  in Fieberiella florii (St\u00e5l) and Philaenus spumarius L..  Further RFLP analyses on R16(X)F1/R1 amplicons  from F. florii with RsaI and SspI restriction enzymes  allowed the identification of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 (table 1).  The finding of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in cherry trees indi- cates an epidemic inside and around the experimental  plum orchards. These phytoplasmas were detected also  in a number of plum plants under evaluation for ESFY  resistance/tolerance. The finding of 16SrIII-A phytoplasmas in two declin- ing cherry trees represent the first evidence of this phy- toplasma presence in cherry in Italy. Previous reports of  16SrIII phytoplasmas in cherry only refers to ribosomal  164 Figure 1.

The same phytoplasmas were identified  in P. spumarius from yellow sticky traps confirming  presence of this phytoplasma in the environment.  However, the role of this insect as possible phyto- plasma vector is under investigation in several differ- ent environments.  The scarcity of captures of C. pruni and the contem- poreneous identification of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in F.  florii represent a finding that deserves extensive further  investigations. It is necessary to reevaluate the insect  vector pattern of ESFY especially in southern European  stone fruit cultivation areas and in the warmest Euro- pean regions.
