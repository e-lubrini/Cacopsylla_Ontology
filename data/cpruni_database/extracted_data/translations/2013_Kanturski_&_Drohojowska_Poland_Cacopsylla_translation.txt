ABSTRACT: This paper is a result of faunistic investigations on jumping plant lice

(Hemiptera: Psylloidea) carried out in 2010-2011 on Garb Tarnogérski. The total of 27

species have been recorded, 5 species are new for Upper Silesia. KEY WORDS: Psylloidea, jumping plant lice, faunistics, Upper Silesia, Garb Tarno-
gorski, Southern Poland. Admission

Koliszki (Psylloidea) constitute a supernatural of suckling phytophages in the area
row of bugs (Hemiptera). They are characterized by a wealth of forms
3000 known species (DROHOJOWSKA et al. 2002) and were
eaten on all continents: from cold Alaska
(HODKINSON & MACLEAN 1980a), Chukotka and the northern part of Russia
(HODKINSON & MACLEAN 1980b) to the hot zones of Africa (HOLLIS 1984)
and Australia (HOLLIS 2004). In Poland, 113 species of
kow (DROHOJOWSKA 2004, DROHOJOWSKA & GLOWACKA 2011). Garb Tarnogorski (KONDRACKI 2001) is also called the Threshold
Srodkowotriasowym (GILEWSKA 1972), or the Ridge of Limestone Shell
wego (SZAFLARSKI 1955). It is the southernmost one
mesoregion in the Silesian Upland. This mesoregion is shaped like
It is very hilly with elevations from 340 to 380 m a.s.l. and it falls apart
reach numerous hills, humps and plateaus. You can on its premises

Garb Tarnogorskiego as well as other regions of the Upland
Slaska has a transitional climate with oceanic features
and continental. Thanks to the close neighborhood of the Moravian Gate,
Here warm and very warm air masses from the sea penetrate here
Srédziemnego (BABCZYNSKA-SENDEK 2005). The Garb Tarnogorski area has only been analyzed in recent years
important in terms of the bug fauna. Research by DEPY and WOJCIECHOW-
SKIEGO (2008) and KALANDYK and WEGIERKA (2010) bring the data
0 aphid (Aphidoidea) and June (Coccoidea) communities. Material and methods

The collection of Garb Tarnogérski koliszków was carried out in the years 2010-
2011. In the study area, samples were collected from March to October,
biweekly. The material was collected with a standard bucket
entomological and the method of "on the target" browsing the plants
host. Micro-preparations were made from the collected material
scoped. For this purpose, the specimens were submerged successively in a KOH solution,
chloralfenol, chloralhyrdate, and then sealed the material in the liquid
Berlese ’go (KLIMASZEWSKI, 1969). The material prepared in this way means
well to the genre. Findings

During the development of the material from the Tarnogérski region
it has been noticed that some individuals have unusual changes in structure
morphological, showing the formation of additional veins on
first pair wing in Craspedolepta nervosa (Fig. 1), Psyllopsis
fraxinicola (Fig. 2, 3, 4), Cacopsylla ambigua (Fig. 5), Cacopsylla
abdominalis (Fig. 6), Cacopsylla hippophaes (Fig. 7) and Trioza rhamni
(Rye. 8) different coloration of wings in Craspedolepta nervosa or
an additional czutka segment in Craspedolepta nervosa (Fig. 9). Changes
of use, colors and the number of particles

construction Such changes were demonstrated in almost 10% of the collected matter. 250

It is also noteworthy that these changes are observed more often
lived in males (75%) than in females and that the most numerous (almost 30%) collected
of the material) concerned the species P. fraxinicola. Dig. 9. Craspedolepta nervosa head

It remains an open question to find so many in this area
individuals with changes in the morphological structure of the wings or feathers. Among almost 40 MA theses made at the Department of Zoology
Of the University of Silesia in the last 36 years concerning the fauna of Kolisz
There is no such material in Gorny Slaska and the surrounding area
there would be so many changes. They were always just singles
cases of such modifications. So far, it has not been published in the journal
any data on the frequency of the occurrence of such
differentiation in this group of insects. Various changes of a terato-
logically, beings described earlier in the beetle (STEBNICKA 1973,
IGNATOWICZ 1976, BUNALSKI and LUBECKI 1990, NowAK 2003, HURUK

2008). However, none of these studies specified the precise source of
fusing the described deformations, and only based on the elaboration
STEBNICKA (1973), the probable cause of such changes was indicated. Among the most common causes, the foundations of
natural (mutations), mechanical, physical and chemical causes 0 sub-
pathological tozu and non-pathological mechanical changes have arisen
during the life of imago (NOWAK 2003). Given the lack of any-
any visible change in the host plants from which the specimens have been harvested
it can be assumed that the reasons for such changes were not unfavorable
environmental conditions that were likely to have influenced, though
minimally, on the appearance of the host plants. We suppose
that genetic changes are the source of such changes, but not comprehensive ones
and careful research on both this group of insects and other groups on this one
the ground, and the plants from which these insects were collected, it remains a weir
a point to be clarified. SUMMARY

27 species of koliszkow have been found in Garb Tarnogérski,
which constitute 24% of the country's fauna and belong to all four represented
in Poland, families, of which the Psyllidae family was the most numerous. Under
from the chorological point of view, the largest number are the Eurosiberian species, such as
and palearctic elements. The demonstration of Rhinocola aceris from boxwood confirms the
temporary assumptions by other authors that this genre shows a great ability
dispersion, i.e. periodic abandonment of the host plant, such as clones (Acer spp.) and flying to others. Reported as numerous only in Pobrzeza
The Baltic Sea Cacopsylla hippophaes is not infrequent in the study area. You can
concluded that the range of the mentioned species is not limited only to the north
country and common can be found throughout its territory, although in the central part of Poland
as well as in neighboring countries, it has not been shown so far. SUMMARY

The study was conducted in the years 2010 and 2011 in the area of ​​Garb Tarnogorski,
a mesoregion of Silesia Upland. The insects were collected directly from their host
plants. The study showed that in 2010-2011 Garb Tarnogérski hosted 27 species of
jumping plant lice, representing 4 families present in Poland: Aphalaridae, Liviidae,
Psyllidae and Triozidae. The species such as Trioza rhamni, Cacopsylla Kapaleki,
Aphalara borealis, Rhinocola aceris, known as rare were exerted and Garb Tarnogorski
is a new distributional record of them. The authors also gave new bionomical data
for Cacopsylla sorbi and distributional data for Cacopsylla hippophaes. HEMIPTERA: PSYLLOIDEA) OF THE TARNOGORSKI TOOK. 253
