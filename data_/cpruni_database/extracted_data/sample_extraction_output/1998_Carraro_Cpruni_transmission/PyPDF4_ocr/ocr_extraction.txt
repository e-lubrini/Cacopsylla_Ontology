SUMMARY
Experimental transmission of European stone fruit
yellows phytoplasma to Japanese plum cv. ÔOzark Pre-

mierÕ was achieved using 
Cacopsylla pruni
, caught in the
field or raised on infected plants under controlled con-

ditions. Using different groups of infectious psyllas,

89% of the inoculated test plants were infected. Both

nymphs and adults were able to transmit. Insects ex-

posed to test plants immediately after capture or raised

in cages transmitted the disease. After an incubation pe-

riod of 4-5 months the first test plants showed typical

symptoms. Sources of inoculum, test plants and vectors

were examined by PCR for the presence of phytoplas-

mas. Following digestion of the amplification products

with restriction enzymes, isolates from plants and in-

sects showed the same restriction profiles. Interestingly,

pear decline and European stone fruit yellows, mem-

bers of the apple proliferation cluster, are both trans-

mitted by 
Cacopsylla
spp.

INTRODUCTION
Phytoplasmas are considered to be the causal agents
of several stone fruit disorders, including plum lep-

tonecrosis, decline of European plums, apricot chlorot-

ic leaf roll, Moli‘reÕs disease and other yellows and de-

cline diseases of stone fruit trees (Sanchez-Capuchino

and Forner, 1973; Morvan, 1977; Giunchedi

et
al.,
(1994) such European stone fruit phytoplasma dis-
eases are believed to have a common aetiology. The

name ÔEuropean stone fruit yellows phytoplasmaÕ

(ESFY-P) has been proposed for the pathogen. On the

basis of sequence and restriction fragment length poly-

morphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified 16S

proliferation (AP) group (Schneider 
et al.,
1993;
et al
., 1994; Lee 
et al.,
et al
.,
1998). This cluster also includes phytoplasmas associat
-
ed with several perennial fruit tree diseases present in

Europe such as AP and pear decline (PD). These phy
-
toplasmas are closely related but distinguishable from

each other (Jarausch 
et al
., 1994; Malisano 
et al
., 1996).
ESFY-P is also distinctly different from the agents of X-

disease and peach yellow leaf roll, major phytoplasma

diseases of stone fruit trees in North America which

have not been shown to occur in Europe (Sinha and

Chiykowsky, 1980; Kirkpatrick 
et al.,
1990; Kison 
et al.,
1997). The possible role of any secondary phytoplasmas

in the decline of stone fruit trees is under discussion

(Lee 
et al.,
1995).
European stone fruit yellows was first described in
Italy by Goidanich (1933) under the name of Ôplum lep
-
tonecrosis
Õ
. Although several species of stone fruits are
susceptible to ESFY (Giunchedi 
et al.,
1982; Poggi
Pollini 
et al
., 1995), the disease is particularly devastat
-
ing for Japanese plum (
Prunus salicina
Lindl.) and apri
-
cot (
P. armeniaca
L.) (Desvignes and Cornaggia, 1982).
The Japanese plum cultivar ÔOzark Premier
Õ
is highly
susceptible to ESFY and was thus used as a test plant in

our experiments. ESFY has caused epidemics in several

areas of northeastern Italy where 50-70% of the plum

trees became infected within the first three or four years

of planting (Carraro 
et al.,
1992). In spite of the high in
-
fection pressure and the rapid spread of the disease, the

natural vector(s) of ESFY remained unknown. In the

early 1990s we began investigations to identify these

vector(s). Initially we examined leafhoppers, but with

no success (Carraro 
et al
., 1992). More recently, many
different species of leafhopper from several infected or
-
chards in the sampling area were analyzed by PCR us
-
ing AP group-specific primers. All were found to be

negative for this phytoplasma (G. Firrao, personal com
-
munication). Consequently, in 1996 we started to focus

attention on psyllids. In the past, several 
Cacopsylla
spp.
were found associated with pear, apple and stone fruit

trees in the orchards monitored. Recent molecular work

has shown that ESFY-P is affiliated to the AP group

et al
., 1998),
which is known to be transmitted by at least two

species of 
Cacopsylla
(Jensen 
et al.,
1964; Lemoine,
1991; Carraro 
et al.,
1998a). 
C. pruni
appeared to be the
most common psyllid on stone fruit in the areas investi
-
gated.
This paper reports the transmission of the ESFY-P
by 
C. pruni
Scopoli, either caught in an infected area
and immediately used for inoculative feeding on test

plants, or raised in cages under controlled conditions

for transmission experiments. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All insects tested and inoculum sources were ob
-
tained from an area where different phytoplasmas are

associated with perennial fruit trees and weeds (Osler

et al.,
1994). Furthermore the three most prominent
diseases of the AP group, 
i.e.
AP, PD and ESFY have
frequently been detected in the last 15 years in this re
-
gion (Refatti 
et al.,
1986; Carraro 
et al.,
1992; Carraro
et al.,
1998a, b). Except for the experiments performed
with caught insects (reported in Table 1), all proce
-
dures involving 
C. pruni 
feeding were carried out in an
environmentally controlled greenhouse with supple
-
mentary light to 16 h/day at 23-25
¡
C. After inocula
-
tion, the test plants were held in separate sectors of the

greenhouse.
Test insects and phytoplasma transmissions
. Start
-
ing from March to April, groups of overwintering

adults of 
C. pruni
were periodically captured in the
sampling area, with a moving net. They were then con
-
fined in groups on the test plants. Five groups of

nymphs and young adults of 
C. pruni
, hatched on in
-
fected stone fruit trees from eggs laid in spring by the

overwintering females, were also used to directly inocu
-
late test plants (Table 1). Eight groups of 30 insects

from the transmission trials were analyzed by PCR us
-
ing the primers f01/r01 (Lorenz 
et al
., 1995). The am
-
plification products were then subjected to RFLP

analysis after restriction with 
Ssp
I and 
Bsa
AI.
In a second experiment, hibernating insects were
confined for a few days for ovideposition on two young

infected ÔOzark Premier
Õ
plants (sources of inoculum),
protected in ventilated plastic net cages. Nymphs of the

third/fourth instar or young adults born in captivity on

infected hosts were grouped and transferred for inocu
-
lative feeding to test plants for 13 to 20 days (Table 2).
For comparison, groups of 
C. pruni
recovered at the
end of the inoculation period reported in Table 2 were

exposed to either three pear or three apple seedlings, as

tests plants for PD and AP. In addition, three groups of

infectious 
C. pyri
L. were transferred to ÔOzark
Premier
Õ
test plants. After inoculative feeding, all test
plants were sprayed with insecticide and held in the

greenhouse for symptom development and for phyto
-
plasma detection tests.

captured on ÔMyrobalan

suckers and plum trees. Some
were also captured from apricot trees, but none were

found on cherry, peach, pear or apple trees. The first

captures of hibernating adults from stone fruit trees

were made at the beginning of March. In May large

populations of nymphs were present, expecially on ÔMy

Test insects and phytoplasma transmission
. Over
-
wintering adults captured in spring survived in captivi
-
ty for up to 2 months. The average survival during the

inoculation access periods was above 90%. Judging

from the large colonies of offspring, the females were

very fertile and the general rearing conditions were

suitable.
In the first trial 2240 adults of 
C. pruni
were caught
in the field and used to inoculate 21 test plants. When

analyzed by DAPI and PCR, 17 of these plants were

phytoplasma-infected (Table 1). More particularly, 13

out of 16 and 4 out of 5 test plants became infected af
-
ter being inoculated in spring by overwintering adults

of 
C. pruni
or nymphs and young adults born from eggs
(new generation), respectively.
All 17 test plants of the second experiment (Table 2)
became infected after exposure to infectious psyllas, ei
-
ther adults or nymphs hatched in cages. Transmission

efficiency of adults and nymphs was similar.
The negative results of PCR analyses indicated that
none of the six groups of the ESFY-P infected psyllas

transmitted to pear or apple test plants. Similarly, nega
-
tive results were obtained when PD-infected 
C. pyri
were transferred to ÔOzark Premier
Õ
test plants.
Phytoplasma detection
. DAPI tests and PCR analy
-
ses gave the same results. Using primer pair fO1/rO1,

ESFY-P DNA was amplified from all samples from

sources of inoculum as well as from 89% of the test

plants used in inoculative feeding, and from the 8

groups of infectious psyllas tested. After the digestion

with 
Ssp
I and 
Bsa
AI, the PCR products obtained from
samples of psylla and Japanese plum always showed the

same restriction profiles, distinguishable from AP and

PD profiles (Fig. 1).
Disease development
. Four to five months after in
-
oculation, the first symptoms of ESFY appeared on the

ÔOzark Premier
Õ
test plants. They consisted of faint but
typical leaf reddening, small leaves, irregular leafing,

leafroll and thickening of the leaf blade. The partial de
-
foliation of several plants was attributable to insect

feeding damage rather than to the disease. 
DISCUSSION 
The results show that 
C. pruni
is a vector of the Eu
-
ropean stone fruit yellows agent. Following digestion

with 
Ssp
I and 
Bsa
AI, all samples (symptomatic inocu
-
lum sources, groups of psylla, and symptomatic test

plants) consistently showed the same restriction pro
-
files, which were identical to those of ESFY isolated on

Catharanthus roseus
by dodder (Loi 
et al.,
1995).
The data in Table 2 show the ability of 
C. pruni
to
transmit ESFY from infected to healthy plum trees un
-
der controlled conditions. In fact the vectors used for

transmission were raised from eggs layed on the experi
-
mentally infected plum trees. The young adults and

nymphs were then removed from these trees and used

for separate inoculation experiments. It is largely ac
-
cepted that vertical (=transovarial) transmission of phy
-
toplasmas in their vector is an exception rather than the

rule (Purcell, 1982).
The transmission efficiency of the groups of 
C. pruni
caught in nature and transferred to infect the test plants

(Table 1) was comparable to that of insects reared on

ESFY-infected ÔOzark Premier
Õ
plants in controlled
greenhouse conditions (Table 2). This indicates that 
C.
pruni
is not only an experimental vector of ESFY-P but
also a natural vector. Furthermore, 
C. pruni
did not
transmit ESFY to apple or pear test plants specific for

AP and PD, nor did 
C. pyri
transmit PD to 
Prunus
.
These data suggest that the three diseases are caused by

different phytoplasmas. In fact the agents of AP, PD,

and ESFY are considered to be closely related but dis

et al

The data obtained underline the biological similari
-
ties between ESFY and PD and AP: the natural spread

of ESFY and PD are both mediated by 
Cacopsylla
spp.;
recently in our laboratory the AP agent was also detect
-
ed in 
Cacopsylla
spp. (Carraro 
et al
., unpublished re
-
sults). ESFY and PD are host species-specific and we

have found no cases of mixed infection, either in the

host plants or in the psylla vectors. In conclusion, in the

rather typical area studied, where AP, PD and ESFY

spread naturally and are present in the same orchard,

the three diseases are clearly distinct.
Our results show that both nymphs and adults of 
C.
pruni
can transmit ESFY but we do not know yet
whether in nature the overwintering adults found in

spring can carry over infection from the previous year.

The important question remains, whether infectivity

may persist from spring to spring in psyllas, without in
-
termediate reacquisition (recharging) (Sylvester and

Osler, 1977). The potential influence of alternative host

plants is also unknown.
On the basis of the positive transmissions by the
groups of psylla born in spring on stone fruit trees

(Table 1, groups 17-21) we can assume that in nature 
C.
pruni
can acquire infectivity from infected stone fruit
trees before abandoning these principal hosts. Our re
-
sults show that in spring all insects can be infectious, in
-
cluding  those found on the principal host after over
-
wintering and those of the spring generation on infect
-
ed stone fruit trees.
We emphasize that the vector of ESFY-P was found
in an area of organic farming where insect populations

are not influenced by use of insecticides.
Further investigations are necessary to study the
main transmission parameters of ESFY and the life cy
-
cle of the vector. It will be necessary to rear a phyto
-
plasma-free colony of 
C. pruni
, taking into account that
this psylla is oligofagous on 
Prunus
, overwinters on wild
plants such as conifers and has a single generation per

year (Conci 
et al
., 1992).
