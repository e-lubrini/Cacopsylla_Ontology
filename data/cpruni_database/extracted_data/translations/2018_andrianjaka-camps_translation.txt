European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) is caused by the phytoplasma ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma prunorum,, which is transmitted from plant to plant by insects of the
genus Cacopsylla, Better knowledge of vector distribution in the orchards and on wild
host plants is crucial for controlling the disease and preventing its spread. Cacopsylla
pruni is known as the vector of ESFY. Recently, a second psyllid, Cacopsylla pinihiemata,
has been identified as a vector; however, its vectoring capacity for ESFY phytoplasma
is still unknown. The objective of this study was to map the distribution of psyllids in
Switzerland and to determine the percentage of infested adults. The occurrence of
psyllid species was monitored by sweeping techniques, and the percentage of infested
adults was analyzed by nested PCR. Psyllid monitoring revealed that C. pruni is
present in every Swiss region, with a similar population density in the different
locations. In contrast, C. pinihiemata was only captured in Valais (southwest), the
main apricot production area. This is probably due to the presence of specific conifers,
which are the overwintering hosts for C. pinihiemata. Infested psyllid adults were
found in half of the monitored regions. The percentage varied between 1.3 and 18.2%
and was not higher in the apricot production area. Surprisingly, in 2013, ESFY
infestation was only found in C. pruni and not in C. pinihiemata. However, in 2012, C.
pinihiemata was also infested by ‘Ca. P. prunorum’. The capacity of the two psyllids in
ESFY vectoring, their importance in ESFY epidemiology and the consequences on ESFY
control strategies are discussed. Keywords: Prunus armeniaca, Prunus spinosa, psyllid monitoring, sweeping techniques,

INTRODUCTION

European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) is caused by the phytoplasma ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma prunorum’. This quarantine disease is an important concern in Europe,
including Switzerland, and causes important economic losses in apricot production
(Marcone et al., 2010). In Valais, the main Swiss production region, orchards are highly
infested with ESFY and up to 4% have to be replaced every year (M. Genini, pers. commun.). ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ is transmitted from plant to plant by Cacopsylla pruni (Carraro et al.,
1998, 2001; Jarausch et al., 2001a; Jarausch and Jarausch, 2010). C. pruni completes one
generation per year strictly on Prunus spp., overwinters as an adult on conifers and then
moves back to Prunus spp., where the transmission of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ occurs (Thébaud et
al., 2009). Observations in different European countries have shown the importance of wild
Prunus spp. in the spread of ESFY (Jarausch et al., 2001b; Carraro et al., 2002; Ramel and
Gugerli, 2004). These studies revealed a high density of C. pruni on wild Prunus, such as
Prunus spinosa. On the contrary and despite a high ESFY susceptibility of Prunus armeniaca,
low population levels of C. pruni were found on apricot cultivars. Recently, a second psyllid, Cacopsylla pinihiemata, has been identified (Sauvion et al.,
2007). The occurrence and distribution of the two psyllids in different countries in Europe
and in Switzerland needs to be investigated, as well as their vectoring ability. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the presence of psyllids in

determine the percentage of ESFY-infested adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS

The occurrence of psyllid species was monitored on P spinosa by sweeping techniques
(three hits on 40 branches) in nine locations in 2012 and in 14 locations in 2013,
representing 13 Swiss cantons. Psyllid biotypes A and B were determined by morphological
identification and were confirmed by PCR. In addition, the presence of ESFY phytoplasma in
psyllids was analyzed by nested PCR (f01/r01) (Peccoud et al., 2013). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Distribution of psyllids in Switzerland

The psyllid monitoring on Prunus spinosa revealed that plum psyllids are present in
every Swiss region, with different population density (Table 1). The number of psyllids
varied between 28 and 357 in 2012 and between 4 and 201 in 2013. C. pruni (biotype B) was
present in every Swiss region. On the other hand, C. pinihiemata (biotype A) was mainly
captured in Valais, the main apricot production area (and in Le Landeron in 2012). However,
the presence of biotype A was not related to the surrounding apricot orchards, but moreover
to the presence of conifers of the genus Pinus, which are the overwintering hosts for biotype
A C. pinihiemata. In Valais, the proportion of biotype A varied between 8% (Conthey in
2012) and 69% (Martigny in 2012) of the total psyllid population. The Swiss distribution of
both biotypes is in accordance with studies from France (Sauvion et al., 2007), where only
biotype B C. pruni is present in the continental climatic zone of France. Furthermore, the
importance of wild plants surrounding apricot orchards in the propagation of ESFY has been
described previously (Jarausch et al., 2001b; Carraro et al., 2002). Determination of the psyllid species and of the percentage of ESFY-infested adults

ESFY is largely present in every Swiss region (Table 1). Infested psyllid adults were
found in eight out of nine locations of the monitored regions in 2012 and in seven out of 14
locations in 2013. In Valais, the captured C. pruni were infested by ‘Ca. P. prunorum’, as well
as C. pinihiemata in 2012, but surprisingly, C. pinihiemata was not detected in 2013. The
percentage of infested psyllids varied between 1 and 15% in 2012 and between 1.3 and 18%
in 2013. The infection rate was not higher in Valais, the apricot production area. The
infection rate in Switzerland was comparable with studies conducted in other European
countries (Carraro et al., 1998; Jarausch et al., 2007; Lethmayer et al., 2011). CONCLUSIONS

C. pruni was found on P spinosa in every monitored location in Switzerland, but the
second vector, C. pinihiemata was only found in Valais. Infested psyllid adults were found in
15 monitored locations; the percentage of infested psyllid adults ranged from 1 to 18%. The
infection rate was not higher in Valais, the apricot production area. This suggests that
infestation by ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in a specific region is highly influenced by the presence of
wild Prunus (and conifers, as overwintering hosts), but not by the presence of apricot
orchards. Valais is the only ESFY-contaminated zone in Switzerland, despite the large presence
of ESFY in every Swiss region. According to our results, the definition of the ESFY-
contaminated zone should be revisited in Switzerland and be based on the presence of ESFY
and not on the presence of apricot orchards. The control of the wild host by removal of every P spinosa tree in the surroundings of
apricot orchards appears to be difficult to implement. Therefore, the control of the vectors is
an important measure to prevent disease spread and to develop a general management
strategy. 240
