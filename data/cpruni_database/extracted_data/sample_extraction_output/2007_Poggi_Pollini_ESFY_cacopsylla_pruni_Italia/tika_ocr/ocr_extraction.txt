Abstract 
 
A severe outbreak of European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) was reported recently in apricot (Prunus armeniaca) orchards in the 
province of Trento. The spreading of the disease has been monitored since 2005 in 4 experimental orchards, planted with ESFY-
free material (cv. Bergeron on Wavit) and treated with different chemical sprays. 

The first results demonstrate that most of the applications have no efficacy in controlling the disease. Studies on the possible 
transmission of ESFY via root bridges have also been included in this research.

Introduction 
 
Surveys have been conducted, since 2004, in different 
apricot orchards to determine the current status of Euro-
pean stone fruit yellows (ESFY) disease in the province 
of Trento. 

In this area a constant spread of the disease has been 
noted in recent years leading to partial or total tree die-
back causing major economic losses to the growers 
(Pignatta et al., 2007). 

The presence of the vector of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma 
prunorum’, of the psyllid Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli), as 
well as of wild reservoirs of the phytoplasma (especially 
Prunus spinosa (blackthorn), Prunus mahaleb and wild 
Prunus domestica) have also been demonstrated (Pignatta 
et al., 2007). 

Recently, new approaches have been developed for 
the detection of fruit tree phytoplasmas in plant material 
and in vectors using a highly sensitive real-time PCR 
assay, useful for large-scale analysis (Baric and Dalla 
Via, 2004; Pignatta et al., 2007). 

The objective of this research was to study the epidemi-
ology of the disease by monitoring the spread of the cas-
ual agent in 4 experimental orchards (about 180 plants 
each) of cv. Bergeron grafted on Wavit, where 25% of 
the propagation material had been previously checked for 
ESFY infection before planting in 2005. All the material 
tested was found to be ESFY-free (Pignatta et al., 2007). 

These orchards were treated with different pesticides in 
2006 to control the vector; the presence of ESFY-like 
symptoms was monitored during the different seasons 
with field observations and subsequent molecular analysis. 

Trials conducted in the same areas under controlled 
conditions demonstrated that the agent of apple prolif-
eration (‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’) can be trans-
mitted by root grafting (Ciccotti et al., 2007). For this 
reason the transmission of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ by natural 
root bridge was also investigated. 

Materials and methods 
 
Visual inspections for typical ESFY-symptoms (early 
budbreaks in winter, premature leafroll in summer and 
autumn) were performed in the experimental fields at 
least three times a year. 

Samples of trees with typical and doubtful symptoms 
were taken and tested for ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ presence 
via real time PCR using a multiplex procedure for si-
multaneous detection of the pathogen and host DNA, to 
avoid false negatives due to PCR inhibition.  

Total DNA was extracted from plants and insects col-
lected in the fields with a phytoplasma enrichment pro-
cedure (Marzachì et al., 1999). All the reagents used in 
real-time PCR were from Applied Biosystems (AB) 
with the exception of the primers, obtained from Invi-
trogen Life Technologies. A multiplex reaction was 
carried out in AB PRISM 7000 SDS; 4 µl of template 
DNA were added to 16 µl of real-time PCR mix con-
taining 1X TaqMan Buffer A, 5.5 mM MgCl2 solution, 
0.5 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase, 0.8 mM 
dNTPs, 750 nM of qAP-16S primers, 150 nM of qMd-
cpLeu primers, 160 nM of qESFY-16S probe and 80 
nM of qMd-cpLeu probe. PCR conditions were: 10 min 
at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C and 1 
min at 60 °C (Baric and Dalla Via, 2004; Pignatta et 
al., 2006). 

Chemical sprays were performed with 3 different pro-
tocols as described in table 1. Two Bergeron/Wavit or-
chards from the same nursery, planted in 2003 and 2004 
were used as untreated controls. All the insecticides 
used are known to provide good activity against apple 
psyllids. 

To study the possible translocation of ‘Ca. P. prun-
orum’ through root bridges, a systemic herbicide (Gly-
phosate) was applied during winter 2006-2007 exclu-
sively on the cut surface of some ESFY-infected trees.

Results 
 
Table 2 shows how the disease increased in 2006 and 
also in spring of 2007 in most of the different experi-
mental fields with no differences as compared with the 
non-sprayed fields. 

Only in one location (Pergine) the ESFY spread was 
extremely low (1 plant with severe decline in summer 
2006 out of 200). The infected plants were promptly 
eradicated. 

The new generation of C. pruni was found in most of 
the orchards examined (table 2). 

After Glyphosate applications no herbicide symptoms 
were found in neighboring trees. Furthermore, these ap-
ricots did not show any expression of ESFY symptoms 
in spring 2007. 
 
 
Discussion 
 
The potential epidemic threat posed by ‘Ca. P. prun-
orum’ in stone fruit orchards is confirmed by the annual 
increase in the number of infected trees in 4 experimen-
tal fields of three year old cv. Bergeron on Wavit. 

Real-time PCR tests performed in the 25% of propa-
gation material suggested that in our conditions new in-
fection of trees is presumably due to the transmission of 
‘Ca. P. prunorum’ by the vector rather than to the con-
tamination of propagation material, as reported in other 
epidemiological studies. 

As regards control measures, the results obtained after 
only one year show that most of the insecticide applica-
tions have no efficacy in controlling the disease as com-
pared with unsprayed orchards.  

ESFY spread was extremely low in only one experi-
mental field (Pergine), but this situation could be due to 
environmental factors which can influence psyllid fit-
ness in different areas. In 2007, however, all treatments 
in the experimental fields were performed following the 
second protocol (treatment no. 2 in table 1). 

In medium-aged and old apple orchards in Trentino, 
natural root bridges are thought to play an important  
role in disease spread (Ciccotti et. al, 2007). On the con-
trary, the results obtained in our research with herbicide 
treatments did not confirm this type of transmission for 
‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in neighboring apricot trees.
