Abstract

The species composition of jumping plant-lice, especially Cacopsylla pruni as a vector of *Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum’, was researched on stone fruit trees in 53 locations, mainly in Central Poland. Twelve species were
found to belong to the families Psyllidae, Aphalaridae and Triozidae. C. pruni which made up 59.9% of the
collected specimens was noted in eight locations in plum orchards and in two locations in cherry orchards. Only
three locations were found to have specimens of C. pruni which were infected by ‘Ca. Ph. prunorum’, namely on
plum trees in the Lesser Poland Province and plum and mirabelle plum trees in the Masoovian Province. In the
latter location, specimens of C. pruni infected with ‘Ca. Phytoplasma asteris’ were also caught in mirabelle plum. trees. We can conclude that at this moment C. pruni is not a significant threat to Polish stone fruit orchards and its

importance in the possible spread of phytoplasma causing European stone fruit yellows is low. Key words: ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’, European stone fruit yellows. Introduction

Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli) is widely distributed
in Europe on oligophagous, univoltine species on plants
belonging to the genus Prunus (Steffek et al., 2012). This species has been found in many locations in
Poland: Pomeranian Lakeland, Masurian Lakeland and
Malopolska Upland (Klimaszewski, 1963), Krakow-
Czestochowa Upland (Smreczynski, 1954), in the Western
Beskids, Nowy Targ Basin, in many places in Pieniny and
the Tatra Mountains (Smreczynski, 1954; Drohojowska,
Glowacka, 2011) and in the Silesian Upland (Kanturski,
Drohojowska, 2013). According to Klimaszewski (1967), in Poland,
C. pruni commonly occurred on plants of the genus
Prunus, but due to the relatively small population, this
species did not cause economic losses. However, it has
been proved that C. pruni is a vector of the ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma prunorum’ (“Ca. Ph. prunorum’) (Carraro
et al., 1998). The presence of this quarantine pathogen,
which causes many diseases on Prunus trees described as
European stone fruit yellows (ESFY), has been reported
from most of the countries in the European Union (Steffek
et al., 2012). This disease was first described on Japanese
plum (Prunus salicina Lindley) in Italy (Goidanich,
1933) and has now become a serious problem affecting
European producers of apricots (Prunus armeniaca L.),
Japanese plums and peaches (P. persica L.). The highest
occurrence of ‘Ca. Ph. prunorum’ has been found in the
countries of the Mediterranean Basin (Thébaud et al.,

Please use the following format when citing the article:

2009; Cieslifska, Morgas, 2011; Steffek et al., 2012;
Sabaté et al., 2015). The study recently carried out in Polish orchards
has pointed to the presence of this pathogen in plum and
peach as well as sweet and sour cherry crops (Cieslifiska,
Morgas, 2011; Ciesliiska, Smolarek, 2015). However,
the scale of damage caused by ‘Ca. Ph. prunorum’ in
Poland is not sufficiently well-known. So far, studies on
the occurrence and identification of potential vectors of
this phytoplasma in Poland have not been carried out. The aim of this research was to determine the
composition of Psylloidea with particular emphasis on
Cacopsylla pruni on Prunus plants in orchards as well
as those growing in the natural environment in selected
regions of Poland and to determine the incidence of
specimens testing positive for ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum’ in order to assess the risk of this phytoplasma
spreading. Material and methods

The species composition of Psylloidea on
plants of the genus Prunus. A study on the occurrence of
psyllids was carried out between 2013 and 2016 inclusive
in'53 locations in different regions of Poland, mainly in
the central area. Besides plum, the monitoring included
peach and apricot as well as sweet and sour cherry
trees. Additionally, samples were also taken from plants

growing close to the surveyed orchards, mainly from
blackthorn (Prunus spinosa L.), and also from coniferous
trees such as Pinus spp. and Picea spp. which are known
to be the overwintering places of jumping plant-lice
species, including Cacopsylla pruni. Samples were taken
using the beat-tray method. A sample collection unit was
defined as the number of individual specimens obtained
from 100 randomly selected branches from a randomly
selected test area of approximately 0.5 hectares at each
test location. The collected insect specimens were checked
under a stereoscopic microscope and identified to
individual species using the entomological key
(Ossiannilisson, 1992). The classifications follow that of
Burckhardt and Ouvrard (2012). Specimens of C. pruni
were preserved in 70% ethanol at —20°C until testing for
the presence of phytoplasma. Identification of the phytoplasma in Cacopsylla
pruni. The total DNA was extracted from samples of C.
pruni consisting of 1-3 individuals using a High Pure
PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche). The DNA was
subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
assay with the universal primer pair P1/P7 (Deng, Hiruki,
1991; Schneider et al., 1995) for amplification of 1.8 kbp
product of the 16S ribosomal DNA, the spacer region
between the 16S and 23S rDNA genes and the 5’-end
of the 23S rDNA of the phytoplasmas. P1/P7 amplicons,
diluted 1:29 with sterile water, were used as templates for
the second round of PCR with the universal primer pair
R16F2n/R16R2 (Gundersen, Lee, 1996). All PCR assays
were performed with a thermocycler PTC-200 (MJ
Research, USA), and 7 1 of the amplification products
was separated in 1% agarose gel in 0.5x TBE (tris-borate-
EDTA) buffer, followed by staining in ethidium bromide
and visualization of DNA bands using UV transilluminator
(Syngen, England). The molecular weight of the PCR
products was estimated by comparison with 100 bp DNA
ladder (Thermo Scientific Ltd., Lithuania). Five ul of the
nested PCR products were separately digested with Rsal
and Sspl restriction endonucleases (Thermo Scientific
Ltd.). The generated restriction patterns were analysed
by electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels in 1% TBE
buffer and compared with the profiles of the following
strains, collected by A. Bertaccini (http://www.ipwgnet. org/collection); ‘Canadidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’
(16SrX-B), ‘Ca. Ph. mali’ (16SrX-A), ‘Ca. Ph. pyri’
(16SrX-C) and ‘Ca. Ph. asteris’ (16SrI-B). These strains
were also compared with previously published restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of
phytoplasmas (Lee et al., 1998). Results and discussion

The species composition of jumping plant-
lice. During the study, a total of 178 samples of insects
were taken from 53 locations, both from stone fruit trees
growing in orchards and plants from surrounding area
(Fig. 1). Twelve jumping plant-lice species were
identified in the collected samples, which were classified
as belonging to three families: Psyllidae, Aphalaridae and
Triozidae. The most represented family was Psyllidae
with eight species of psyllids while Aphalaridae and
Triozidae were represented only by a small number of
species (Table 1). © ~ C. pruni found, ¢ — C. pruni not found, X ~ ‘Candidatus

Figure 1. Locations surveyed in order to determine the
presence of jumping plant-lice

The percentage of C. pruni caught on trees or
shrubs differed depending on the plant species, making up
66.9% of all specimens collected from plums (Fig. 2 A),
6.4% of specimens from sweet and sour cherries (Fig. 2 B), 35.0% of specimens on blackthorn (Fig. 2 C) but
only 1.5% of the specimens collected from coniferous
trees (Fig. 2 D). This may suggest that plum trees are
among the preferred host plants of C. pruni. The C. pruni
occurrence was observed in plum orchards primarily
in the spring (March—May), but not in the summer
(June—July). Similar results were obtained in the studies
conducted in other countries, e.g., in France and Spain
(Labonne, Lichou, 2004; Thébaud et al., 2009; Sabaté
etal., 2015). Among the psyllids collected from Prunus
plants, a high proportion of C. melanoneura was noted. It should be pointed out that in contrast to males, the
females of C. melanoneura and C. affinis are impossible
to distinguish by morphological criteria (Tedeschi et al.,
2009). However, given that only two C. affinis specimens
were found of the dozens of males belonging to these
two species, it can be said that C. melanoneura was the
dominant species in this complex. Relatively large number of individuals of this
species caught is probably related to the fact that in the
spring this species re-migrates from its overwintering
sites to hawthorn or apple trees being the most commonly
cultivated fruit tree in Poland. Plum trees, as well as
other fruit plants, could potentially be only “accidental”
feeding or landing places for C. melanoneura at this time
of year. It has been shown that among plants in the
surrounding orchards, C. pruni was found much more
often in blackthorn than in coniferous plants in the
growing season (Table 2, Fig. 2 C and D). The fact that
the C. pruni prefers blackthorn has been confirmed and
described by other researchers (Labonne, Lichou, 2004). On the other hand, this psyllid readily overwinters on
conifer plants, located at some distance from stone fruit
tree orchards (Yvon et al., 2004; Cermak, Lauterer, 2008). In our study, however, samples were largely taken from

conifers growing in the immediate vicinity of the surveyed
orchard, which could be the reason why a relatively small
number of C. pruni were collected. Although C. pruni
was the most numerous species on Prunus, considering
its frequency of occurrence in the samples, as well as its
occurrence in various locations, it can be concluded that
this species usually occurs sporadically and locally. In
general, the presence of C. pruni was noted in 26 samples,
coming from 11 locations (Fig. 1, Table 2). It should be noted that during this study,
observations were carried out mainly inprotected orchards,
in which the number of psyllids could have been reduced
as a result of chemical treatments carried out against
other pests. Such a possibility is indicated by the results
obtained in one of the villages in Masovian Province in
2016. In this area, C. pruni was not recorded in the tested
plum orchard, which was surrounded by apple trees
chemically protected against C. melanoneura. However,

this species occurred relatively frequently on unprotected
mirabelle plum trees growing at some distance from those
protected apple trees. The effect of chemical treatments
on C. pruni density is indirectly indicated by the fact that,
on wild, unprotected blackthorn, this species occurred in
46.2% of the monitored locations and in 35.0% of the
samples, while in protected plum orchards C. pruni was
noted in only 25.8% of the monitored locations and in
18.8% of the samples (Table 2). On the other hand, the
preference of blackthorn by C. pruni cannot be ruled out
(Lauterer, 1999; Labonne, Lichou, 2004). Occurrence of phytoplasmas. Of the 261
specimens of C. pruni which were analysed for
phytoplasma infection, 203 were collected from plum
trees, 53 from blackthorn, four from cherry, and one
from conifers. The presence of ‘Ca. Ph. prunorum’ in
the C. pruni bodies was limited geographically, since the
pathogen was detected in only two of the eleven localities
where this psyllid species was found. ‘Ca. Ph. prunorum’
was identified in three samples of psyllids that came from
Masovian Province (one sample from plum trees growing
in an orchard and two from the chemically unprotected
mirabelle plum trees (Prunus domestica subsp. syriaca)
growing nearby) and one from a plum orchard located in
the Lesser Poland Province (Fig. 3). Rsal

Prunus sp. trees surveyed in Masovian Province and
Lesser Poland Province

Furthermore, it was found that the level of psyllid
infection differed between years, For example, in one of
the orchards in Lesser Poland Province the level varied
between 1.6% and 4.7% (for 64 collected individuals)
in 2013, while in 2014 ‘Ca. Ph. prunorum’ was not
detected in any of the 43 collected specimens. Similarly,
in the orchard in the Masovian Province, the infection
rate in 2013 for 21 tested specimens of C. pruni was
between 4.8% and 14.3%, while in 2016 the presence of
phytoplasma was not detected in the bodies of insects. Generally, considering analysis of the total
number of C. pruni specimens (207) collected from
stone fruit trees in all the test locations and tested for the
presence of ‘Ca. Ph. prunorum’, the degree of infection
by this pathogen can be estimated at between 1.9% and
5.3%, or, if we also include specimens collected from
blackthomn (53) and coniferous plants (1), the infection
rate was between 1.5% and 4.2%. These values were
lower than those obtained for C. pruni in the apricot
orchards in Moravia, or in stone fruit orchards in several
regions of Spain, where the rate of infection in the spring
period reached tens of percent (Fialova et al., 2004:
Sabaté et al., 2015). Interestingly, two samples of C._ pruni
individuals, caught on mirabelle plum trees in Masovian
Province were infected with ‘Ca. Ph. asteris’. On the
same plants, C. pruni infected with ‘Ca. Ph, prunorum’
were found, which confirms that a single psyllid species
can carry more than one pathogen. On the other hand, the
same phytoplasmas may be transferred between plants by
various insects (Weintraub, Beanland, 2006; Bosco et al.,
2007). Previous studies indicate that the aster yellows
group phytoplasmas are transmitted by different species
of leafhoppers. In the literature, there is no information
on the transfer of these pathogens by C. pruni. Research
in this area should be extended and include a greater
number of tests to confirm or rule out the relationship
between C. pruni and ‘Ca. Ph. asteris’. The threat to stone fruit trees by ESFY depends
on many factors. Apart from vector abundance and
the level to which they are infected with phytoplasma,
differences in the susceptibility of Prunus spp. plants
to ‘Ca. Ph. prunorum’ are also important. Species
susceptible to the phytoplasma include Japanese plum,
apricot and peach, while plum, sweet cherry, sour cherry,
blackthorn and cherry plum are either rarely infected or
are at least tolerant to infection (Giunchedi et al., 1982;
Jarausch et al., 2000; Carraro et al., 2002). The stone
fruit trees grown in Polish orchards are mostly tolerant
to phytoplasma. Peach and apricot trees account for only
about 6.3% of stone fruit tree plantings, while Japanese
plum accounts for no more than 1%. Due to the relatively large area of host plants
and the presence of both the pathogen and its vector in

Poland, under favourable conditions the threat to Polish
orchards by ESFA may change. One other factor that is
becoming more relevant is the observed climate change
taking place in Poland (Tomezyk et al., 2015). There is
evidence that climate warming is having an effect on
population size increase of many pests (Krishnareddy,
2013). The increase in air temperature and drought can
promote not only the development of psyllids, but also
the phytoplasma multiplication in the cells of host plant
and in the insect vector. In consequence, this may lead
to an increased risk of ESFY occurrence in the orchards. In addition, economic losses in the future may be higher
if the planting of thermophilic plants, particularly those
sensitive to infection by ‘Ca. Ph. prunorum’ such as
apricot, peach or Japanese plum increases. Conclusion

The study showed that at this moment
Cacopsylla pruni is not a significant threat to Polish stone
fruit orchards and its importance in the possible spread
of phytoplasma causing European stone fruit yellows is
low. Acknowledgements

Sokinéjanciy augaliniy blakuéiy, ypaé Cacopsylla pruni kaip ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ perneséjo,
raging sudétis buvo tirta kaulavaisiy medziuose 53 vietovése, daugiausia Centrinéje Lenkijoje. Buvo nustatyta 12
rasiy, priklausangiy Psyllidae, Aphalaridae ir Triozidae Seimoms. C. pruni sudaré 59,9 % visy surinkty vabzdziy
a’tuoniuose vietovése slyvy soduose ir dviejose vietovése vysniy soduose. Tik trijose vietovése buvo rasti C. pruni
vabzdziai, uzsikréte ‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum’, biitent ant slyvy medziy Mazosios Lenkijos vaivadijoje ir ant
mirabelés pomologinés veisliy grupés slyvos medziy Mazovijos vaivadijoje. Pastarojoje vietoveje ‘Ca. Phytoplasma
asteris’ uzsikréte C. pruni vabzdziai buvo pagauti mirabelés pomologinés veisliy grupés slyvos medziuose. Galima daryti i8vada, kad Siuo metu C. pruni néra didelé grésmé Lenkijos kaulavaisiy sodams, o jo svarba perneSant
fitoplazma, sukeliangiq europing kaulavaisiy medziy gelta, néra didelé. Reik8miniai Zodziai: ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’, europiné kaulavaisiy medziy gelta.
