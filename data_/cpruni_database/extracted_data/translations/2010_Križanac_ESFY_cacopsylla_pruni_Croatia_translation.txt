Abstract

Asurvey started in 2002 (KriZanac et al. 2008) was continued
to determine the diversity of phytoplasmas infecting fruit
trees and their vectors in Croatia. Leaf and twig samples from
32 commercial orchards located in all major fruit growing
regions of Croatia, were visually inspected for symptoms and
tested for the presence of the phytoplasma 16S rDNA as were
adjacent symptomless wild Prunus species, and potential in-
sect vectors from seven orchards. Phytoplasmas belonging to
‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’ and ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ (riboso-
mal subgroups 16SrX-C and 16SrX-B, respectively) were the
most widespread and had the highest incidence in pears and
stone fruits, respectively. ‘Ca. P. asteris’ (16Srl-B) was found
sporadically in both fruit trees and vectors, while phytoplas-
mas of the stolbur group (16SrXII-A) was frequently found in
pear. Mixed infections were detected in one pear and one Jap-
anese plum. The high incidence and wide geographical distri-
bution of stolbur phytoplasma in pears along with its presence
in Cacopsyla pyri, the main vector of pear phytoplasma, calls
for investigation of the role of this phytoplasma in the devel-
opment of pear decline in Croatia. Cacopsylla pyrisuga, a sus-
pected ‘Ca. P. pyri’ psyllid vector, was also found to harbour
stolbur phytoplasma. This study revealed higher phytoplasma
diversity in fruit trees and vectors than anticipated. Key words: 165 rDNA PCR-RELP, aster yellows, Cacopsylla

Zusammenfassung

In Kroatien wurde, in Fortsetzung eines 2002 begonnenen
Projektes (KriZANac et al. 2008), die Diversitét Obstbaum
infizierender Phytoplasmen und ihrer Vektoren untersucht. Blatter und Zweige von insgesamt 32 kommerziell gefiihrten
Obstanlagen aus allen Obstbaugebieten des Landes wurden
im Sommer und Herbst visuell hinsichtlich ihrer Symptome
untersucht. Ebenfalls wurde das Material - ebenso wie Proben
von benachbarten, symptomlosen wilden Prunus-Arten und
Insekten aus sieben Obstanlagen - auf das Vorkommen von 16
1DNA getestet. Phytoplasmen, die den Untergruppen 16SrX-C
und 16SrX-B (‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’ und ‘Ca. P. pru-
norum’) angehéren, waren am weitesten verbreitet mit dem
héchsten Befall an Birnenbaéumen und Steinfriichten. ‘Ca. P. asteris’ (16SrI-B) wurde sporadisch sowohl in Obstbaumen
als auch in den Vektoren gefunden, wahrend Phytoplasmen
der Stolbur-Gruppe (16SrXII-A) nur gelegentlich in Birnen
nachgewiesen werden konnten. Mischinfektionen wurden
einmal in Pyrus communis und einmal in einer japanischen
Prunus-Art nachgewiesen. Hoher Befall und weite geogra-
phische Verbreitung von Stolbur-Phytoplasmen (16SrXII-A)
konnte in Birnen und dem Hauptvektor Cacopsyla pyri gezeigt
werden. Auerdem konnte Cacopsylla pyrisuga als Vektor fiir
Stolbur-Phytoplasmen nachgewiesen werden. Die Untersuchun-

gen ergaben insgesamt eine héhere Diversitat an Phytoplas-
men in Obstbaéumen als erwartet wurde. Stichwérter: 16S rDNA PCR-RELP, aster yellows, Cacopsylla

1 Introduction

Phytoplasmas are non-cultivable, wall-less prokaryotes be-
longing to the monophyletic clade of the class Mollicutes
(IRPCM 2004). They inhabit phloem tissue of plants, as well
as various cell types of insects and their life cycle involves
replication in both plant and insect hosts (HOGENHOUT et al. 2008). These endocellular parasites are associated with eco-
nomically important diseases in several hundred plant species
(Berraccint 2007), which is reflected in their historical
descriptive names. Due to the inability of growing phyto-
plasmas in axenic cultures, their phylogeny is mainly based on
conserved genes sequence analyses, particularly on the 16S
rRNA gene (GUNDERSEN et al. 1994; IRPCM 2004), a common. bacterial phylogenetic marker. Apple proliferation (AP), Euro-
pean stone fruit yellows (ESFY) and pear decline (PD), phyto-
plasmas associated with devastating diseases of fruit trees, are
classified as subgroups A, B and C, of the ribosomal group
16SrX, respectively (Lex et al. 2000). AP, PD and ESFY phyto-
plasmas were assigned to different taxa on the basis of differ-
ences in their host specificity, vector transmission and phylo-
genetic markers different from the 16S rRNA gene (IRPCM
2004; SEEMULLER and SCHNEIDER 2004), namely ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma mali’, ‘Ca. P. pyr’ and ‘Ca. P. prunorum’, respec-
tively. The chromosomes of all three phytoplasmas appear to
be linear, an unusual feature for phytoplasmas (Kus et al. 2008). The three above-mentioned phytoplasmas, AP, PD and
ESFY, can cause economically important losses in fruit trees
by significantly reducing tree vigour and yield. They are
vectored in nature by psyllids. ‘Ca. P. pyri’ is transmitted by
Cacopsylla pyricola and C. pyri (JENSEN et al. 1964; CaRRARO et
al. 1998a); ‘Ca. P. mali’ by C. costalis (syn. C. picta) and
C. melanoneura (FRISINGHELLI et al. 2000; TrDEscHi et al. 2003;
JarauscH et al. 2003), and ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ by C. pruni
(Carraro et al. 1998b). It is suspected that ‘Ca. P. pyri’ can also
be transmitted by C. pyrisuga (KuCEROvA et al. 2007). All
vectors are present in Europe. The occurrence of pear decline and apple proliferation
diseases in apple and pear trees was first reported in Croatia
in the nineteen hundred seventies and eighties (CvseTKovic
1976; Sari¢ and CweTKovic 1985; CverKovic et al. 1987), re-
spectively. Williams pear trees grafted on pear seedling root-
stocks from Dalmatia (coastal part of Croatia) were severely
affected at the time. Besides typical leaf reddening and down-
ward curling, midvein necrosis and general decline symp-
toms, discoloured necrotic line at the graft union were regu-
larly recorded (pers. obs.). The proliferation symptoms were

the most prominent in Red Delicious apples of Ormoz (Slove-
nia) and north-western Croatia, however, without clear indi-
cation of the Croatian locations. Over 70% of apple trees in
those areas had proliferation symptoms. Their fruits were very
small and insipid. The presence of phytoplasma cells in leaf
mid vein sieve tubes of apples and pears was demonstrated by
electron microscopy. Oxytetracycline therapy of pear trees
over a period of two years resulted in recovery (Sari¢ and Cv-
JETKOVIC 1985). In spite of the economic importance of fruit tree phyto-
plasmas in Croatia, a systematic survey of these pathogens
and their potential insect vectors is lacking. In the last decade,
PD symptoms have been frequently observed, especially in
newly planted pear orchards of continental Croatia. In 2002,
the first monitoring of symptoms of phytoplasma in pears was
started. The detection of phytoplasma in pears, apples, as well
as in their vectors was done in 2003 and 2004 (KriZanac et al. 2008). The aim of the current research was to extend the
survey by including observations from more locations and
years, and by including more fruit types, namely stone fruits
in addition to pome, as well as their potential psyllid vectors. 2 Materials and methods
2.1 Materials

Collection of plant and insect samples. Thirty-two commer-
cial orchards, which grew either pome or stone fruits, and
were located in one of the three fruit growing regions in Croatia
(Fig. 1) were chosen for the survey. The separation in regions
is based on agro-climatical zoning (Fig. 1). The regions also
differ in the way orchards are managed. They will be referred
to as continental west (CW), continental east (CE) and Adri-
atic (AD). The orchards were visually inspected for the pres-
ence of AP-, PD- and ESFY-like symptoms during summer and
autumn in four consecutive years (2002-2005). Leaf and twig
samples were collected from symptomatic fruit trees and spo-
radically from adjacent asymptomatic wild Prunus species and
transferred to CaCl to dry. In 2004 and 2005, potential insect
vectors were monitored and collected using the beating meth-

od (STEINER 1967) from seven orchards distributed throughout
the three regions. In addition, in 2006 and 2007, psyllids were
monitored in ten pear and three apple orchards located in the
CW and CE regions. Five to fifteen psyllids were captured per
location and kept in 95% ethanol until species identification
and nucleic acids extraction. Phytoplasma reference strains. The phytoplasma reference
strains were obtained from the collection of DiSTA Phytoplas-
mology laboratory, University of Bologna, Italy (IRPCM 2004;
http://137.204.42.130/person/collection-september_2003. pdf) either as nucleic acids extracts or micropropagated plants
of Catharanthus roseus L. Don, the main experimental phyto-
plasma plant host. The following reference strains were used
in PCR and RFLP analysis for comparison: AP-15 (ribosomal
subgroup 16SrX-A); GSFY-1, GSFY-2 (16SrX-B); PD (16SrX-C);
SA-1, STOL (16SrXII-A) and HYDB (16SrI-B). 2.2 Methods

Nucleic acids extraction. Total nucleic acid (TNA) was ex-
tracted from plant samples following the procedure described
by ANcELINI et al. (2001) with modifications introduced by
Seruca et al. (2003). Approximately 200 mg of CaCl-dried
leaf midribs and/or phloem tissue scrapings was used. After
insect species identification, TNA was extracted from batches
of five insects per species. Per location, at least one batch of
insects per species was analyzed for phytoplasma presence. DNA amplification. Direct PCR assays were performed using
phytoplasma universal primers R16F1/RO (Lee et al. 1995)
and first nested PCR was primed by R16F2n/R2 (GUNDERSEN
and Lee 1996). Nested PCRs, using group specific primers
R16(X)F1/R1 and R16(1I)F1/R1 on R16F2n/R2 amplicons as
templates, were performed (Lex et al. 1994) for the confirma-
tion of phytoplasma identity in mixed infections as well as for
obtaining more sensitive diagnosis. For all other experimental
conditions and procedures see Seruca et al. (2003). ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum

RFLP analysis. R16F2n/R2 and R16(1)F1/R1 amplicons were
digested with Tru91 (= Msel) restriction endonuclease (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). For samples show-
ing profiles of the 16SrX group, additional digestions of
R16F2n/R2 amplicons with Rsal and SspI (Fermentas, Vilnius,
Lithuania) were performed in order to determine the ribo-
somal subgroup affiliation. Obtained fragments were sepa-
rated by electrophoresis through 5% polyacrylamide gel and
stained with ethidium-bromide. RFLP patterns were com-
pared with those of reference strains. 3. Results
3.1 Symptoms

The most prominent symptoms of all monitored fruit tree
species were observed in pear orchards, especially those in the
CW region (Fig. 1). In the majority of the sampled pear trees,
symptoms reminiscent of PD were observed, encompassing
slow decline with leaf reddening and curling, reduced plant
vigour, as well as decreased fruit set and size. In apple trees,
small fruits with elongated peduncles and enlarged leaf
stipules were observed, which suggests AP, although these
symptoms are not necessarily indicative of AP. In stone fruit
trees, symptoms were less prominent and varied considerably. Leaf rolling and yellowing, or reddening, were mostly ob-
served in apricot and peach, respectively. The development of
leaves and flowers late in the vegetative season (autumn bud
break) was observed in some samples of sweet and sour cher-
ry, peach and Japanese plum, while proliferation mostly oc-
curred in the European plum and almond. No symptoms,
which could indicate phytoplasma presence, were recorded in
wild Prunus spp. (P. cerasifera, P. mahaleb, P. spinosa, Prunus
sp.) neighbouring some of the monitored orchards. 3.2 Insect vectors

Five known phytoplasma psyllid vectors, namely Cacopsylla
melanoneura, C. picta, C. pruni, C. pyri and C. pyricola were
identified in all surveyed parts of Croatia and throughout the
years 2002-2007. Their population density varied and could
be correlated to the insecticide treatments performed in the
orchard for controlling economically important insect pests
(e.g. leaf roller, leaf miner, codling moth, aphids) emerging at
the same time in the season as the psyllids. The exception to
this observation was C. pyri, which is resistant to most insecti-
cides. ‘AP vector C. melanoneura was more widespread and
numerous than C. picta in apple orchards. Of all psyllid species
captured on apples, C. melanoneura represented 50.9%,
76.3% and 60.2%, while C. picta represented 45.4%, 22% and
38.4% in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. The remainder
of psyllid populations in apple consisted of C. crataegi, whose
share in the populations varied from 1.4-3.7%, depending on
the year. However, the geographical distribution of C. crataegi
was rather limited. It was found only in two locations (Jastre-
barsko and Skudelin). Throughout the monitoring period, C. pyri was the most
prevalent psyllid in pear (76.4%-80.8%), while the other
known PD vector, C. pyricola, was present only in 2.4%, 1.7%
and 8.5% of the populations in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respec-
tively. A potential PD vector, C. pyrisuga, was consistently the
second most abundant psyllid in pear, with 19.1%, 21.6% and
10.7% in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. C. bidens was
found only sporadically in 2005 and 2006, with 1.6% and
0.3%, respectively. As expected, psyllid population density in
intensively managed pears was higher, but diversity was low-
er, than in extensively managed pears. In the intensively man-
aged orchards, the average number of psyllids per orchard col-
lected at one trial was about 200, and consisting mainly of one

species (C. pyri). In contrast, in extensively managed orchards,
the average number of psyllids was 5-10 individuals per or-
chard, and the diversity was greater. Relatively low population density of C. pruni, a known vec-
tor of ESFY, were found in plum, apricot, peach, wild Prunus
cerasifera and P. spinosa. This vector was absent from sweet
and sour cherry orchards. The average number of C. pruni
adults varied per year and per monitoring between 10 and 26
per orchard. The presence of vectors was not monitored in al-
mond orchards. 3.3 Phytoplasma detection and identification

In the first nested PCR assay, 1.2 kb products were used for
phytoplasma identification based on the R16F2nR2/Tru9I
system (Fig. 2). In the case of infection with ribosomal group
X phytoplasmas or stolbur alone (Tables 1 and 2), identifying
group affiliation was possible solely on the basis of the
R16F2nR2/Tru9I system. Second nested PCR primed by group
specific R16(X)F1/R1, confirmed the identification for riboso-
mal group X phytoplasmas. PCR amplifications, using primers
R16(DF1/R1 (Fig. 3) specific for ribosomal groups 16Srl,
16SrII and 16SrXII (Ler et al. 1994; Totu et al. 2006) and
digestion of the resulting 1.1 kb long products using Tru9I,
enabled identification of mixed infections in several samples of
fruit trees and vectors yielding additional positives and thus in-
creasing the sensitivity of detection (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 3). From 35 out of 78 samples obtained from fruit trees or wild
Prunus sp. (Table 1), as well as from 10 out of 24 insect samples,
phytoplasma 16S rDNA was amplified (Table 2, Fig. 1). Besides
single infections, one pear harboured phytoplasmas belonging
both to the ribosomal subgroups 16SrX-C and 16SrXII-A, and
one Japanese plum harboured phytoplasmas belonging to both
the ribosomal subgroups 16SrI-B (‘Ca. P. asteris’, Lee et al. 2002) and 16SrX-B. Phytoplasmas from different subgroups
were also found in single or mixed infections in C. pyri samples
(Table 2, Fig. 3). However, since DNA was extracted from
batches of 5 insects, it is also possible that individual insects
harboured different phytoplasmas in single infections. 4 Discussion

Management strategies of phytoplasmoses presently rely on
disease prevention through quarantine measures, eradication
programs, production of pathogen free planting material and
chemical control of insect vectors. The implementation of
these measures is not possible without sensitive diagnostic
tools, and basic knowledge of phytoplasma occurrence in fruit
trees and of their potential vectors in the fruit growing areas. Apart from early efforts in identifying phytoplasmoses of ap-
ples and pears (CvseTKoviG 1976; Saric and CvJerKovic 1985),
very little was known about the occurrence of phytoplasmoses
in fruit trees in Croatia, even though AP, PD and ESFY can be
quite devastating diseases. Moreover, there is no data regard-
ing phytoplasma occurrence in fruit tree planting material
that is either produced in the country or imported from
abroad. The results of a pilot study, investigating the phyto-
plasma presence by PCR-RELP in pomatious fruits and their
potential psyllids vectors (KriZanac et al. 2008), confirmed
the occurrence of various ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ taxa in
both plants and psyllids. At the time, only nine pear and three
apple orchards were investigated, and insects were collected
only in five pear orchards. In view of this and the reports of
fruit tree phytoplasma presence in neighbouring countries
(Brzin et al. 2003; Emper et al. 2004; Deti¢ et al. 2005; Dupuk
et al. 200Sa; Dupux et al. 2005b), it was deemed important to
continue the survey on phytoplasma presence in both pome
and stone fruit trees and their potential psyllid vectors. The occurrence of PD-like symptoms in pear was positively
correlated with the occurrence of phytoplasma infections. No

correlation was found between severity and type of symp-
toms, and phytoplasma type. Orchards in Jastrebarsko and
Voloder that were included in the study by Krizanac et al. (2008) were revisited. A roughly equal proportion of pear samples were infected
by either ‘Ca. P. pyri’ or stolbur (16SrXII-A). According to our
knowledge, this is an unprecedented finding for pear. The
relatively high incidence of stolbur in pears, in one sample
probably mixed with ‘Ca. P. pyri’ (Table 1), indicates that stol-
bur is common in pears, in contrast to ‘Ca. P. asteris’ in a pear
in Jastrebarsko (CW region). The finding of stolbur in pear is
epidemiologically important because stolbur is widespread in
Croatia, especially in vineyards (SeRuGA Music et al. 2009),
which are often situated in the vicinity of orchards. Stolbur
was not only found in pears, but also in both known PD vec-
tors, C. pyri and C. pyricola, as well as in the suspected vector
C. pyrisuga (Table 2). C. pyri was investigated in three addi-
tional locations (Ciée, St. Petrovo selo, Vucjak Feri¢anacki),
and C. pyrisuga in two (Osijek and Vuéjak Feri¢anaéki) with
regard to the previous study (KriZanac et al. 2008), while oth-
er locations were continued to be monitored until 2007. In the
psyllid populations obtained from pear, the abundance of C.
pyri was the highest, averaging 78%, followed by C. pyrisuga
(17.3%) and C. pyricola (4.2%). This trend remained constant
throughout the investigation period. Unlike the oligophagous
psyllids present in pears (JarauscH and JarauscH 2010), cixiid
vectors that transmit stolbur in other crops and weeds are
polyphagous (Malxner 2010). One could easily envisage a sce-
nario in which cixiids could transmit stolbur from grapevines
and/or weed reservoirs to pear. However, to investigate this
was beyond the scope of this study and the epidemiological
significance of these findings remains to be investigated. Phytoplasma infections of apples, so far, could not be
ascribed to the common agent ‘Ca. P. mali’. Previously, ‘Ca. P. pyr? and stolbur phytoplasma have been found in a few
apple orchards (KriZAnac et al. 2008). The samples of
C. melanoneura and C. picta from two locations in the CW and
CE regions (Table 2) probably did not represent the natural
psyllid populations in apple, because sampling was allowed
only in a few commercial orchards that were heavily treated
with insecticides. Historical AP findings (Sari¢ and CvseTKovic

Krizanac et al. : Fruit tree phytoplasmas and vectors in Croatia

 

1985) together with recent AP reports in neighbouring states
(Brzin et al. 2003; Deuic et al. 2005; Dupuk et al. 2008) and
the occurrence of known AP-vectors, C. melanoneura and
C. picta, in surveyed apple orchards, can be taken as strong
indications of AP presence in Croatia. The observed higher
abundance of C. melanoneura compared to C. picta in apple
poses an interesting starting point for epidemiological and/or
insecticide resistance investigations. The recent increase in
apple production in the country, the predominant use of local
planting material and the scarcity of molecular data on phyto-
plasma identity, call for the continuation of the study in apples
and AP vectors before drawing relevant epidemiological and
disease management conclusions. In the framework of this study, 61 new samples of stone
fruits and three samples of C. pruni were analysed. Phytoplas-
mas could not be identified in European plum, almond or sour
cherry even though samples were taken from plants with
symptoms potentially indicative of phytoplasmoses. Due to
the rigorous detection system that included a second round of
nested PCR with group specific R16(X)F1/R1 in addition to
the more general R16(I)F1/R1 primers, we can exclude the
possibility that phytoplasmas at very low concentrations were
missed. This suggests that symptoms in plum, almonds, and
sour cherry could have been caused by other biotic or abiotic
agents. Oniy one sweet cherry sample from CE region harboured
stolbur phytoplasma (Table 1). Tree decline (PaLTRINIERI et al. 2008) or other severe symptoms that could specifically be
associated with phytoplasma presence were not observed in
sweet cherry. The ESFY agent ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ was identified
in its main vector C. pruni, in one asymptomatic wild Prunus,
and in the majority of symptomatic apricot and Japanese plum. samples, but only in one peach (Fig. 1; Table 1). In five more
peach samples stolbur (16SrXII-A) and aster yellows (16SrI-B)
phytoplasmas were identified which was unusual, but not
unprecedented for these hosts (PALTRINIERI et al. 2001; Dupuk
et al. 2008). With three phytoplasma taxa, peach hosts the
most types of phytoplasmas of all the stone fruittrees, whilst
apricot and Japanese plum follow by hosting two, sometimes
in mixed infection (Table 1). This is in accordance with the
postulated higher susceptibility of the three above-mentioned
hosts to phytoplasma infections (Carraro et al. 1998b). As yet,
phytoplasma infection in peach, apricot or Japanese plum has
not resulted in a severe disease development that could poten-
tially endanger local production. The results presented here suggest the widespread occur-
rence of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ and ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in Croatia, the most
important pear and stone fruit phytoplasma agents, respec-
tively, as well as their psyllids vectors. This calls for implemen-
tation of comprehensive control strategies for fruit tree phyto-
plasmas and their vectors. High incidence and wide geograph-
ical distribution of stolbur phytoplasma in pears suggests its
involvement in pear decline in Croatia. This is also true for a
suspected new ‘Ca. P. pyri’ vector, C. pyrisuga, that harboured
stolbur phytoplasma. The epidemiological relevance of the
latter two findings, as well as the epidemiology of phytoplas-
moses in apples needs to be investigated further. Acknowledgements
