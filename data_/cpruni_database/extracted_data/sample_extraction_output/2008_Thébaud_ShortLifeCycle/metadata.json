Abstract  Cacopsylla pruni is the vector of \u2018Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019,  responsible for the disease called European stone fruit yellows. In this work we  obtained new data on the overwintering of C. pruni and we measured the evolution  of the quantity of phytoplasma in the insects after acquisition. The life cycle of C.  pruni was completed for the first time, demonstrating directly that it is a univoltine  species. From the data obtained on the overwintering places, we assume that the  overwintering takes place through long distance migrations from Prunus to conifers.  We demonstrated that when C. pruni are grown on an infected Prunus, they  accumulate the phytoplasma and then multiply it so that after the overwintering  period the phytoplasma concentration is at its uppermost value. The young adults of  the new generation, although frequently infected, had a low transmission efficiency.  Despite multiplying the phytoplasma, the healthy reimmigrant vectors fed on ESFY- infected Prunus appeared to die before they could transmit it to other plants. Thus,  it seems that the overwintering reimmigrants infected the previous year are the most  efficient vectors of the phytoplasma and that the dissemination of the disease should  be understood at a regional scale.    INTRODUCTION  European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) is a disease damaging mainly apricot  (Prunus armeniaca) and Japanese plum (P. salicina) orchards in Europe. It is due to a  phytoplasma for which the name \u2018Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019 has been proposed  (Seem\u00fcller & Schneider, 2004).   This phytoplasma is spread by the psyllid Cacopsylla pruni (Carraro et al., 1998).  C. pruni is supposed to be a univoltine species reproducing on Prunus sp. and  overwintering mainly on conifers (Ossiannilsson, 1992). In France, its distribution, host  preference and period of presence on Prunus have been studied (Labonne & Lichou,  2004). Two successive morphs were observed on Prunus: a dark-winged form  corresponding to the reimmigrants coming back for reproduction after overwintering; a  light-colored form corresponding to the adults of the new generation. But the knowledge  about the overwintering period is very poor and the life cycle of the species has not been  completed until now.  During the last six years, the transmission properties of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 by C.  pruni have been intensively studied, mainly by Carraro et al. (1998, 2001, 2002, 2004).  However, two important points remained unclear: the persistence of the phytoplasma in  its vector during the overwintering period and the possibility of successful transmission  by reimmigrants if they acquire the phytoplasma after their coming back on an infected  plant. These two points are epidemiologically important as they determine if transmission  from infected plants to healthy plants occurs within a year or between years.  The aim of this work was to obtain the complete life cycle of the insect, to get  information about what happens to the phytoplasma in the vector during the  overwintering period, to assess the possibility of the reimmigrants to acquire and transmit  the phytoplasma during their reproductive period on Prunus and to connect the biology of  the vector to the transmission processes.     MATERIALS AND METHODS  Overwintering of C. pruni  The presence of C. pruni on conifers was investigated by searching for the insect  in different places at a regional scale. To complete the life cycle of the insect, adults of  the new generation were reared on Prunus marianna in climatic chambers and then, they  were set under sleeve cages on conifer branches at identified natural overwintering sites  during the supposed overwintering period (July-February).     Acquisition and Transmission of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 by C. pruni  Reimmigrants of C. pruni were collected from regional natural populations on P.  spinosa. The insects were set for acquisition under sleeve cages on infected P. marianna  plants. These plants were inoculated mainly by grafting with the same isolate of \u2018Ca. P.  prunorum\u2019 one or two years before the experiments. A small number of acquisition  experiments were made with other isolates and two other plant species (P. armeniaca, P.  salicina) to avoid any problem which could be linked to the Prunus species or to the  phytoplasma isolate. After a defined time of acquisition, the insects were set on healthy  test plants (young cuttings of P. marianna) by groups of 5 to 15 adults. Two sets of  transmission experiments were performed (2003 and 2004). A large sample of C. pruni  from the natural populations was included as control to achieve enough statistical power  for detecting an effect of the acquisition on the transmission efficiency.  Infected nymphs and adults of the new generation were produced in climatic  chambers from eggs laid by the reimmigrants on the previously described source plants.  They were set for transmission on healthy P. marianna as previously described.  The psyllids which were still alive were collected 20 days after inoculation. Test  plants were then sprayed with an insecticide and incubated in an insect-proof greenhouse.     Detection of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019  Total DNA was extracted from the phloem of Prunus using CTAB as described by  Maixner et al. (1995). Total DNA of each insect was extracted by the same procedure  modified following Marzachi et al. (1998). Detection of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in plants and  insects was performed by PCR using the specific primer pair ESFYf/r (Table 1). The  inoculated plants were checked for phytoplasma infection after at least 6 months  following the inoculation.    Quantification of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in C. pruni  A real-time PCR method using TaqMan\u00ae chemistry was designed, calibrated and  used to measure the evolution of the phytoplasma titer inside the insects after  phytoplasma acquisition. A 18S rDNA fragment (GenBank accession numbers  DQ778629 to DQ778635) of C. pruni was used as an internal standard. Serial dilutions of  cloned rDNA fragments from the phytoplasma and of the standard gene were used to  obtain the calibration curves. Primers and probe are listed in Table 1.    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Overwintering of C. pruni  During the years 2002-2005 a survey was carried out on the conifers around  Montpellier. We were unable to detect C. pruni on the Pinus halepensis surrounding the  blackthorn hedges and bushes in the plain. C. pruni was found on P. halepensis in small  numbers but regularly on the first line of hills north of Montpellier. It was found with a  greater abundance on the plateau (altitude: 700 m) and the mountainous area (altitude:  1100-1400 m) on Abies alba, Abies sp, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris.   Three sites were chosen to try an artificial overwintering of C. pruni: 2 natural  sites on Abies sp. and P. abies and in the plain on P. halepensis. The 3370 adults of the  new generation obtained in climatic chambers were enclosed on conifer shoots under  sleeve cages. Surviving C. pruni were recovered at all the 3 sites at the end of their  natural overwintering period. The proportion of surviving adults inside the cages was  irregular (0% to 54%) but generally small (mean: 4%). For each site, a sample of  surviving C. pruni was recovered and set on P. marianna plants. The eggs laid on each  plant developed normally in nymphs and new adults.   Thus, for the first time, the biological cycle of C. pruni has been completed,  demonstrating directly that the individuals found on conifers are the same than those  reproducing on Prunus and that there is only 1 generation per year. Moreover, the  distance of several tenths of km between the plain and the plateau and mountains seems to  imply large migration movements of this insect.    Detection of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in Overwintering C. pruni  Samples of C. pruni collected on conifers in winter were checked for the presence  of the phytoplasma. Eight out of 256 were detected infected. This result demonstrates that  the phytoplasma persists in its vector during the overwintering period.  From 5 adults reared on an infected plant, set to overwinter on conifers and  recovered after the overwintering period, 4 were detected still infected and 3 out this 4  were able to transmit the phytoplasma to a healthy plant. The transmission efficiency of  the infected reimmmigrants after overwintering seems thus very high.    Transmission of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 by C. pruni  Transmission experiments carried out in 2003 and 2004 with reimmigrants  indicated that about 0.5% of the sampled populations of C. pruni were infectious (95%  confidence intervals: [0.19% - 1.13%] in 2003; [0.04% - 1.14%] in 2004). Whatever the  duration of the acquisition period on infected plants and the duration of the transmission  period, we were unable to find out any significant increase of the transmission efficiency,  despite the large number of insects tested (Table 2).   The adults of the new generation reared on infected plants were able to infect a  few test plants but they showed a transmission efficiency of only 0.6% (Table 3). As the  emerging adults of C. pruni exhibit a strong emigration behavior (quick takeoff from their  Prunus hosts), it can be thought that the feeding behavior of the new adults on Prunus  plants can prevent the transmission of the phytoplasma. A similar proportion of the old  nymphs reared on infected plants was able to transmit the phytoplasma (Table 3).    Quantification of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in C. pruni  The growth of the number of phytoplasma in C. pruni after a defined acquisition  period was measured either for reimmigrants arriving on an infected plant or for the new  generation reared on an infected plant and overwintering afterward on conifers (Fig. 1).  When C. pruni was reared on infected plants, the quantity of phytoplasma  increased with time from a mean of 5.4\u00d7104 phytoplasma in the nymphs collected 19 to  21 days after hatching to 2.0\u00d7107 phytoplasma in the adults at the end of the  overwintering period. As the highest phytoplasma titer was found in C. pruni  overwintering on conifers, it demonstrates that the phytoplasma is conserved or  multiplied in the insects outside their reproduction host.   After acquisition on an infected plant (even after only 1 day), the reimmigrants  contained a measurable quantity of phytoplasma, clearly differentiating them from the  control insects. The mean quantity of phytoplasma measured after 1, 2, 10 or 21 days of  acquisition remained around 104 and the quantities measured in different individuals were  quite similar. After the reimmigrants vectors were transferred from infected plants to  healthy plants, the quantity of phytoplasma differed greatly depending on the individuals.  Some insects lost almost completely the phytoplasma while in the others the quantity of  phytoplasma reached values between 106 and 107. This 100-fold increase relatively to the  previous values can be explained only by a multiplication of the phytoplasma inside the  insects after an initial delay. Through these results, this delay can be evaluated around 30  days after acquisition.  From the tested individuals, 4 were able to transmit the phytoplasma to a healthy  plant. In these individuals, the amount of detected phytoplasma was at its uppermost  value (between 107 and 108) in the 4 cases.    CONCLUSION  For the first time, the entire life cycle of C. pruni was experimentally completed,  the persistence of the phytoplasma in the vector during overwintering was demonstrated  and the growth of the phytoplasma concentration was measured all along the life cycle of  the vector.   The synthesis of the results on the life cycle of C. pruni and of its transmission  efficiency at different stages of its life suggests the following scenario for the  dissemination of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019: the young psyllids would get infected when living on  an infected plant, either cultivated or wild; although infected, they would be poor vectors  at this stage; after migrating to overwinter on conifers, the insects would either lose,  conserve or multiply the phytoplasma; most reimmigrants still infected at the end of the  winter would be infectious and able to inoculate susceptible plants when they return to  reproduce on Prunus. This scenario implies that the reimmigrants would be the most  efficient vectors of the phytoplasma. The wild Prunus may play a central role because  they produce numerous vectors and they are reservoirs of the phytoplasma (Carraro et al.,  2002). Questions remain about the distances and trajectory of the migratory flights, but  the scenario implies a regional scale for the spread of the phytoplasma, as the migrations  of C. pruni seem to occur at distances of several tens of kilometers, at least in  southeastern France.
