Several uncultivated trees of the species Prunus spinosa, P. cerasifera and P. domestica, sampled both adjacent to European
stone fruit yellows (ESFY)-infected orchards and in isolation from cultivated stone fruit plants, were found to be infected
by ESFY phytoplasma. These species were also colonized by Cacopsylla pruni, vector of the ESFY agent. In contrast,
uncultivated species of Prunus avium, P. cerasus and P. mabaleb hosted neither the pathogen nor the vector. Insect- and
graft-transmission trials of ESFY phytoplasma conducted under controlled conditions confirmed the data obtained in
the field. The role played by the wild Prunus species is discussed and appears to be fundamental in the epidemic cycle of

the disease. Keywords: Cacopsylla pruni, phytoplasma, polymerase chain reaction, transmission, vector

Introduction

Several stone fruit (Prunus) species in Europe are affected
by severe diseases associated with phytoplasmas. These
include apricot chlorotic leaf roll (Morvan, 1977), plum
leptonecrosis (Giunchedi et al., 1978) and peach yellows
(Poggi Pollini et al., 1993). Lorenz et al. (1994) determined
the common aetiology of these diseases and proposed
the single name ‘European stone fruit yellows’ (ESFY). Occurrences of ESFY have been reported in Spain
(Sanchez Capucino & Forner, 1973), France (Desvignes
& Cornaggia, 1982), Italy (Giunchedi et al., 1978), Slovenia
(Brzin et al., 2001), Greece (Rumbos & Bosalidis, 1985),
Romania (Ionica, 1985), Germany (Lederer & Seemiiller,
1992), Czech Republic (Navratil et al., 2001), England
(Davies & Adams, 2000) and Austria (Laimer da Camara
Machado et al., 2001). ESFY phytoplasma induces economically important
disorders in apricot (Desvignes & Cornaggia, 1982),
Japanese plum (Dosba et al., 1991) and peach (Marcone
et al., 1996). European plum is generally tolerant to ESFY
(Carraro et al., 1998a; Jarausch et al., 2000). The disease
also affects almond and various Prunus rootstocks
(Jarausch et al., 1998; Kison & Seemiiller, 2001). Recently,
Jarausch et al. (2001b) detected ESFY phytoplasma in six
different wild-growing Prunus species as well as in Celtis
australis, Fraxinus excelsior and Rosa canina growing in

the surroundings of ESFY-infected apricot orchards in
France. The presence of wild plants is important for the epide-
miology of the disease because the pathogen can survive
and spread without the presence of susceptible cultivated
plants. Up to now the exact role played by wild Prunus
and non-Prunus species in the epidemiology of ESFY was
not clear. For example, it is not known if these plants host
Cacopsylla pruni, the vector of the disease (Carraro et al.,
1998b; Jarausch et al., 2001a), and whether it can infect
them. Likewise, it is not known if they are end-hosts for
the pathogen or sources of inoculum for transmission of
the phytoplasma to cultivated plants. The objectives of the
present study were: (i) to determine the presence of ESFY
phytoplasma in wild Prunus species in an area of north-
east Italy with a high infection pressure; (ii) to verify the
presence of C. pruni on the different Prunus species and
clarify the capability of C. pruni to infect these plants; and
(iii) to ascertain the exact role of wild Prunus species in the
epidemiology of the disease. Materials and methods

Samplings to determine the presence of ESFY
phytoplasma and its vector in wild Prunus species

Surveys were carried out in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia
(F-VG) region, north-east Italy, where ESFY is epidemic
(Carraro et al., 1992). In the years 2000 and 2001, from
July to October, repeated samplings were made in five
different areas; two (Cavazzo and Spessa) were located in
the surroundings of ESFY-infected apricot and Japanese

plum orchards and three (Cornino, Romans and Udine)
were far from any stone fruit orchard. All Prunus spp. plants, with or without typical phytoplasma symptoms,
were considered and some of them tested for the presence
of ESFY phytoplasma by using PCR/RFLP analyses. Particular attention was given to Prunus spp. which were
common to all the sites. In Cavazzo and Spessa, some
non-Prunus species with light or faint symptoms of
yellows and/or decline were sampled and analysed. The
complete list of the sampled plants is given in Table 1. During 2000-01 the presence/absence of C. pruni on wild
Prunus and on other species of plants was checked
periodically by shaking the insects onto an underlying
net. Three groups of 10 individuals each of the captured
C. pruni were also analysed for the presence of ESFY
phytoplasma. Transmission trials with C. pruni

All the transmission experiments were carried out in an
environmentally controlled glasshouse at 23-25°C with
supplementary light and 16-h days. In April 2001, groups
of overwintering adults of C. pruni were captured as
above in the stone fruit orchards of Cavazzo and Spessa. ‘Twenty groups, each of five individuals, were immediately
tested by PCR/RFLP for ESFY phytoplasma; the other
psyllids were confined in groups of 50 individuals on each
test plant until their death. Longevity of the insects as well
as oviposition on the test plants were checked. The choice
of the test plants was based on the surveys carried out
during 2000. Consequently, species common to all the
analysed sites and known to be
typical in north-east Italy (B. mabaleb and P.padus) were
selected. For each selected species, five potted seedlings
were exposed to the vector. After inoculation, the test
plants were held in separate sectors of the glasshouse,

   
   

where they were observed for 6 months for symptom
expression and then analysed by PCR/RFLP. Seedlings
of apricot cv. Canino were used as susceptible controls,
either noninoculated or exposed to the vector. Negative
controls were unexposed seedlings of the selected Prunus
species. ‘Transmission trials by grafting

In May 2001, groups of plants of the same Prunus species
used in the transmission trials with C. pruni were graft-
inoculated (four plants per species) in the glasshouse. The
sources of inoculum were 10 Japanese plum trees infected
in previous experiments by vector (Carraro et al., 1998b). Four chip-buds and one approach graft were used for each
test plant. In July 2001, five 1-year-old micropropagated
Japanese plum trees were graft-inoculated (two chip-buds
and one approach-graft) each by using as the source of
inoculum one ESFY-infected P. spinosa tree from the
Romans location. Testing for the presence of ESFY phytoplasma in plants
and in psyllids

Using PCR/RELP, all the plants listed in Table 1, the
sources of inoculum used in the graft-transmission trials,
groups of C. pruni, the inoculated test plants and a repre-
sentative number of negative controls were tested for the
presence of ESFY phytoplasma. A modification of the phytoplasma-enrichment pro-
cedure developed by Kirkpatrick (Malisano et al., 1996)
was adopted for the DNA extraction from plants, using. 1 g of leaf petioles and midrib tissues; for extraction of
insect DNA the Doyle & Doyle (1990) method was used. The presence of ESFY phytoplasma was determined by
nested PCR using the universal phytoplasma primers

P1/P7 (Schneider et al., 1995). After 1:40 dilution, 5 uL. of PCR products obtained in the initial amplification were
used as a template for further amplification with the
nested primers f01/r01 (Lorenz et al., 1995). The primer
pair f01/r01 are specific for the fruit-tree phytoplasmas —
ie. ESFY, apple proliferation and pear decline - all
belonging to the phylogenetic group ‘apple proliferation’
(Seemiiller et al., 1998). The final PCR products (5 uL)
were analysed by electrophoresis in 1-5% agarose gel and
visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and UV illu-
mination; 10 1L of the PCR products were then digested
with Bsa AI, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Bio Laboratories, Beverly, MA, USA). Restriction frag-
ments were resolved in 2% agarose gel. Results

Presence of ESFY phytoplasma and of C. pruni in wild
Prunus species

Using PCR/RELP, the ESFY phytoplasma was detected in
several wild Prunus species (Table 1) growing both near
ESFY-infected orchards (Spessa and Cavazzo) and far
from stone-fruit orchards (Cornino, Romans and Udine). Considering all the localities, the Prunus species that
tested positive for ESFY phytoplasma were: P. cerasifera
(eight trees out of the 11 analysed), Prunus domestica
(one out of two) and P. spinosa (eight out of 32). Among
these, ESFY-infected P. cerasifera and P. spinosa were
present at all the sites checked. Prunus avium, P. cerasus
and P. mahaleb, as well as the non-Prunus species
analysed, were found not to be infected by ESFY phyto-
plasma. The infected plant of P. domestica collected in
Spessa was symptomless; only one infected P. spinosa
plant (collected in Cornino) showed symptoms of small
leaves and off-season growth in winter; all the infected
P. cerasifera plants showed slight leaf roll at the end of
summer. The presence of C. pruni was confirmed on P. spinosa,
P. cerasifera and P. domestica; both overwintering adults
in April-May and individuals of the new generation in
June-July were observed and captured. The vector was
not found on P. avium, P. mahaleb or P. cerasus, or on the
non-Prunus species examined. Two of the three groups of
C. pruni analysed by PCR/RFLP were ESFY-infected; one
of these groups was captured in Spessa on P. spinosa and
the other in Udine on P. cerasifera. S15

‘Transmission trials with C. pruni and by grafting

Eight of the 20 groups of C. pruni, each of five individuals,
tested by PCR/RFLP immediately after their capture, were
ESFY-infected. In terms of single insects, the minimum
percentage of psyllids carrying phytoplasmas was 8%. The results of the transmission trials, both with the vector
C. pruni and by grafting, are reported in Table 2. Cacopsylla
pruni transmitted ESFY agent to four of the five P. spinosa
and P. cerasifera test plants and to all of the apricot
control plants. In contrast, the exposed P. mahaleb and
P. padus plants were found to be healthy by PCR/RFLP
analyses. The infected P. spinosa and P. cerasifera test
plants never showed symptoms of phytoplasma infection;
on the other hand, the infected apricot plants showed the
typical leaf roll and decline symptoms. Under glasshouse
conditions, the mortality of C. pruni (Table 2) was high
on P. mabaleb and P. padus, intermediate on apricot and
low on P. spinosa and P. cerasifera. Eggs and individuals
of the new generation, born under controlled conditions,
were observed only on apricot, P. spinosa and P. cerasifera. All the graft-inoculated apricots, P. spinosa and P.
cerasifera and none of the P. mabaleb and P. padus test
plants became ESFY-infected; symptoms were observed
only on apricot. Three of the five Japanese plum trees graft-inoculated
using P. spinosa as the source of inoculum became
infected and developed typical symptoms: leaf reddening,
small leaves, leaf roll and thickening of the leaf blade. Phytoplasma detection in plants and psyllids

In nested PCR, using the primer pair P1/P7 followed by
nested primers f01/r01, ESFY phytoplasma DNA was
amplified from all the sources of inoculum used in the
transmission trials by grafting as well as from some of the
wild and test plants and groups of psyllids analysed
(Fig. 1). No DNA amplification was obtained from the
negative controls. After digestion with Bsa Al, the PCR
products obtained showed the same ESFY restriction
profile (Fig. 2). Discussion

European stone fruit yellows is one of the most important
pathological problems of stone fruit in Europe. The typi-
cally epidemic disease spreads quickly and can compromise

species, apricot and Japanese plum (Carraro et al., 1992;
Jarausch et al., 1998). ESFY is also commonly epidemic in
areas like the F-VG region, Italy, where stone-fruit trees
are rarely cultivated. In this area, Carraro et al. (1998a)
hypothesized the passage of early natural infections from
wild to cultivated Prunus spp. This hypothesis was later
reinforced after the verification that C. pruni is the vector
of ESFY phytoplasma (Carraro et al., 1998b). The insect,
whose recorded presence in F-VG dates from 1888, is
in fact strictly oligophagous on Prunus spp. (Conci et al.,
1992). Bearing in mind that the disease is epidemic but
also spreads in scarcely cultivated areas, and the vector is
restricted to Prunus spp., the role played by wild Prunus
spp. in the epidemic cycle of ESFY is explained in the
present work. First, the diffuse presence of the ESFY agent
in P. spinosa, a species native to Europe and Caucasic

  

region (Pignatti, 1982), was shown and the agent was also
detected in wild P. cerasifera and P. domestica plants. Infected wild Prunus spp. plants were present both in the
surroundings and far from cultivated stone-fruit orchards,
confirming the established presence of the disease in the
F-VG region. In other wild plants P. avium, P. cerasus and
P. mabaleb — the ESFY agent was not detected. There was
a correlation between the vector, the agent of the disease
and the host plants: only the Prunus species hosting the
vector also hosted the agent. The non-Prunus plants
analysed — in particular R. canina, reported to be ESFY-
infected in France (Jarausch et al., 2001b) - were not
confirmed as hosts of either C. pruni or ESFY phytoplasma. The transmission trials conducted in the glasshouse
confirmed the data obtained in the field. Groups of
naturally infected C. pruni (Carraro et al., 2001) trans-
mitted ESFY phytoplasma to P. cerasifera and P. spinosa
test plants, as well as to apricot controls. Furthermore,
these plants also hosted the vector, on which it lay eggs that
hatched. The susceptibility of P. cerasifera and P. spinosa
to ESFY phytoplasma was also confirmed by graft trans-
mission. Besides, the
ESFY agent was graft-transmitted from one naturally
infected P. spinosa plant to Japanese plum test plants, thus
further confirming that this species is an important natural
host and a widespread potential source of inoculum for
ESFY and infection of cultivated Prunus spp. In conclusion, the role of some wild Prunus species in
the epidemiology of European stone fruit yellows is now
clarified: wild P. spinosa, P. cerasifera and P. domestica
plants are natural hosts for both ESFY phytoplasma and
the vector C. pruni. Therefore, the cycle of ESFY can
be completed independently from the presence of ESFY-
infected cultivated stone-fruit trees. In areas like this part
of north-east Italy, where both the vector and the agent
are present on wild Prunus species, the disease appears to
be endemic, Other wild Prunus spp.—P. avium, P. cerasus,
P. mabaleb and P. padus - do not play an important
epidemiological role because they host neither the vector
nor the pathogen. Research is continuing with the main aims of explain-
ing the reported presence of ESFY phytoplasma in plants
other than Prunus spp. (Jarausch et al., 2001a,b) and its
sporadic detection in P. avium ( Jarausch et al., 1999) and
P. cerasus (Navratil et al., 2001). The presence of secondary
vector(s) of ESFY can be hypothesized, as can the natural
distribution of different strains of the phytoplasma. References
