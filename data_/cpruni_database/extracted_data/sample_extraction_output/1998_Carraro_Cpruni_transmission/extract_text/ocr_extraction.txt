SUMMARY

Experimental  transmission  of  European  stone  fruit
yellows phytoplasma to Japanese plum cv. ‘Ozark Pre-
mier’ was achieved using Cacopsylla pruni, caught in the
field or raised on infected plants under controlled con-
ditions.  Using  different  groups  of  infectious  psyllas,
89%  of  the  inoculated  test  plants  were  infected.  Both
nymphs  and  adults  were  able  to  transmit.  Insects  ex-
posed to test plants immediately after capture or raised
in cages transmitted the disease. After an incubation pe-
riod  of  4-5  months  the  first  test  plants  showed  typical
symptoms. Sources of inoculum, test plants and vectors
were  examined  by  PCR  for  the  presence  of  phytoplas-
mas. Following digestion of the amplification products
with  restriction  enzymes,  isolates  from  plants  and  in-
sects showed the same restriction profiles. Interestingly,
pear  decline  and  European  stone  fruit  yellows,  mem-
bers  of  the  apple  proliferation  cluster,  are  both  trans-
mitted by Cacopsylla spp.

di  susino  giapponese  con  evidenti  sintomi  di  ESFY.
Nelle prove di trasmissione successivamente condotte si
è potuto dimostrare che tale specie di psilla è vettore del
fitoplasma associato a ESFY. Oltre agli adulti svernanti
ed alle ninfe e adulti della nuova generazione raccolti di-
rettamente in frutteti infetti, anche ninfe ed adulti alle-
vati  in  cattività  hanno  trasmesso  il  patogeno  in  studio.
Dopo inoculazioni multiple, 89% delle piante test (susi-
no cv. ‘Ozark Premier’) sottoposte ad analisi mediante il
test  DAPI  e  PCR-RFLP  è  risultato  infetto.  Le  stesse
piante  hanno  anche  manifestato  dopo  4-5  mesi  i  tipici
sintomi della malattia, fatta eccezione per la necrosi del
floema.  Sottoponendo  a  digestione  enzimatica  il  DNA
amplificato di fitoplasmi ottenuto dalle piante sorgente
di  inoculo,  dalle  piante  test  e  dai  vettori  animali,  sono
stati ottenuti costantemente gli stessi profili di restrizio-
ne. Sulla base dei dati finora a disposizione, emerge che
i  fitoplasmi  inclusi  nel  gruppo  genetico  degli  scopazzi
del  melo  (es.  moria  del  pero  e  giallume  europeo  delle
drupacee) sono trasmessi da psille.

INTRODUCTION

Phytoplasmas are considered to be the causal agents
of  several  stone  fruit  disorders,  including  plum  lep-
tonecrosis, decline of European plums, apricot chlorot-
ic leaf roll, Molière’s disease and other yellows and de-
cline  diseases  of  stone  fruit  trees  (Sanchez-Capuchino
and  Forner,  1973;  Morvan,  1977;  Giunchedi  et  al.,
1982; Rumbos and Bosalidis, 1985; Dosba et al., 1990;
Poggi  Pollini  et  al., 1993;  Lee  et  al., 1995;  Marcone  et
al., 1996; Carraro et al., 1998b). According to Lorenz et
al., (1994) such European stone fruit phytoplasma dis-
eases  are  believed  to  have  a  common  aetiology.  The
name  ‘European  stone  fruit  yellows  phytoplasma’
(ESFY-P) has been proposed for the pathogen. On the
basis of sequence and restriction fragment length poly-
morphism  (RFLP)  analysis  of  PCR-amplified  16S
rDNA,  the  agent  of  ESFY  is  placed  within  the  apple

proliferation  (AP)  group  (Schneider  et  al., 1993;
Seemüller et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1995; Seemüller et al.,
1998). This cluster also includes phytoplasmas associat-
ed  with  several  perennial  fruit  tree  diseases  present  in
Europe such as AP and pear decline (PD). These phy-
toplasmas  are  closely  related  but  distinguishable  from
each other (Jarausch et al., 1994; Malisano et al., 1996).
ESFY-P is also distinctly different from the agents of X-
disease  and  peach  yellow  leaf  roll,  major  phytoplasma
diseases  of  stone  fruit  trees  in  North  America  which
have  not  been  shown  to  occur  in  Europe  (Sinha  and
Chiykowsky, 1980; Kirkpatrick et al., 1990; Kison et al.,
1997). The possible role of any secondary phytoplasmas
in  the  decline  of  stone  fruit  trees  is  under  discussion
(Lee et al., 1995).

European  stone  fruit  yellows  was  first  described  in
Italy by Goidanich (1933) under the name of ‘plum lep-
tonecrosis’. Although several species of stone fruits are
susceptible  to  ESFY  (Giunchedi  et  al., 1982;  Poggi
Pollini et al., 1995), the disease is particularly devastat-
ing for Japanese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) and apri-
cot (P. armeniaca L.) (Desvignes and Cornaggia, 1982).
The  Japanese  plum  cultivar  ‘Ozark  Premier’ is  highly
susceptible to ESFY and was thus used as a test plant in
our experiments. ESFY has caused epidemics in several
areas  of  northeastern  Italy  where  50-70%  of  the  plum
trees became infected within the first three or four years
of planting (Carraro et al., 1992). In spite of the high in-
fection pressure and the rapid spread of the disease, the
natural  vector(s)  of  ESFY  remained  unknown.  In  the
early  1990s  we  began  investigations  to  identify  these
vector(s).  Initially  we  examined  leafhoppers,  but  with
no  success  (Carraro  et  al.,  1992).  More  recently,  many
different species of leafhopper from several infected or-
chards in the sampling area were analyzed by PCR us-
ing  AP  group-specific  primers.  All  were  found  to  be
negative for this phytoplasma (G. Firrao, personal com-
munication). Consequently, in 1996 we started to focus
attention on psyllids. In the past, several Cacopsylla spp.
were found associated with pear, apple and stone fruit
trees in the orchards monitored. Recent molecular work
has  shown  that  ESFY-P  is  affiliated  to  the  AP  group
and  is  closely  related  to  PD  (Seemüller  et  al.,  1998),
which  is  known  to  be  transmitted  by  at  least  two
species  of  Cacopsylla (Jensen  et  al., 1964;  Lemoine,
1991; Carraro et al., 1998a). C. pruni appeared to be the
most common psyllid on stone fruit in the areas investi-
gated.

This  paper  reports  the  transmission  of  the  ESFY-P
by  C.  pruni Scopoli,  either  caught  in  an  infected  area
and  immediately  used  for  inoculative  feeding  on  test
plants,  or  raised  in  cages  under  controlled  conditions
for transmission experiments. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

All  insects  tested  and  inoculum  sources  were  ob-
tained  from  an  area  where  different  phytoplasmas  are
associated  with  perennial  fruit  trees  and  weeds  (Osler
et  al., 1994).  Furthermore  the  three  most  prominent
diseases of the AP group, i.e. AP, PD and ESFY have
frequently been detected in the last 15 years in this re-
gion (Refatti et al., 1986; Carraro et al., 1992; Carraro
et al., 1998a, b). Except for the experiments performed
with  caught  insects  (reported  in  Table  1),  all  proce-
dures involving C. pruni feeding were carried out in an
environmentally  controlled  greenhouse  with  supple-
mentary  light  to  16  h/day  at  23-25°C.  After  inocula-
tion, the test plants were held in separate sectors of the
greenhouse.

Test  insects  and  phytoplasma  transmissions.  Start-
ing  from  March  to  April,  groups  of  overwintering
adults  of  C.  pruni were  periodically  captured  in  the
sampling area, with a moving net. They were then con-
fined  in  groups  on  the  test  plants.  Five  groups  of
nymphs  and  young  adults  of  C.  pruni,  hatched  on  in-
fected  stone  fruit  trees  from  eggs  laid  in  spring  by  the
overwintering females, were also used to directly inocu-
late  test  plants  (Table  1).  Eight  groups  of  30  insects
from  the  transmission  trials  were  analyzed  by  PCR  us-
ing  the  primers  f01/r01  (Lorenz  et  al.,  1995).  The  am-
plification  products  were  then  subjected  to  RFLP
analysis after restriction with SspI and BsaAI.

In  a  second  experiment,  hibernating  insects  were
confined for a few days for ovideposition on two young
infected  ‘Ozark  Premier’ plants  (sources  of  inoculum),
protected in ventilated plastic net cages. Nymphs of the
third/fourth instar or young adults born in captivity on
infected hosts were grouped and transferred for inocu-
lative feeding to test plants for 13 to 20 days (Table 2).

For comparison, groups of C. pruni recovered at the
end of the inoculation period reported in Table 2 were
exposed to either three pear or three apple seedlings, as
tests plants for PD and AP. In addition, three groups of
infectious  C.  pyri L.  were  transferred  to  ‘Ozark
Premier’ test  plants.  After  inoculative  feeding,  all  test
plants  were  sprayed  with  insecticide  and  held  in  the
greenhouse  for  symptom  development  and  for  phyto-
plasma detection tests.

Sources  of  inoculum.  Experimental  sources  of  in-
oculum were potted young ‘Ozark Premier’ plants inoc-
ulated by grafting in the greenhouse using ESFY-infect-
ed budwood derived from trees of symptomatic ‘Ozark
Premier’ and  asymptomatic  but  infected  ‘Myrobalan’
(P. cerasifera Ehrh.).

adults of the spring generation born on infected stone fruit trees. After inoculative feeding the test plants were treated with insec-
ticide and kept in the greenhouse for symptom development and DAPI and PCR analysis (b).

Fluorescence microscopy. All test plants and sources
of inoculum were examined using DAPI (4’,6-diamidi-
no-2-phenyl  indole)  (Seemüller,  1976).  Specimens  (3-5
x 8-10 mm) of twigs were placed in 5% glutaraldehyde

in 0.1  M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and kept at 4°C for
one day. After rinsing in buffer, they were cut longitu-
dinally  with  a  freezing  microtome  (Leica  Jung  CM
1500).  The  20  µm  thick  sections  were  treated  with
DAPI (1 µg ml-1 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) and
examined with a fluorescence microscope (Leitz Ortho-
plan  with  Pleomopack  2.1).  Healthy  ‘Ozark  Premier’
plants, grown in the greenhouse, were used as negative
controls.

DNA  amplification  and  RFLP  analyses.  DNA  was
isolated  from  approximately  1  g  of  leaf  petiole  and
midrib tissues from each of the test plants, the sources
of inoculum and from individual  groups of 30 C. pruni.
A  modification  of  the  phytoplasma  enrichment  proce-
dure  developed  by  Kirkpatrick  (Malisano et  al.,  1996)
was  used  for  extraction  of  DNA  from  healthy  and  in-
fected  plants  and  the  method  of  Doyle  and  Doyle
(1990)  for  extraction  of  insect  DNA.  The  presence  of
phytoplasmas was determined by PCR using the riboso-
mal primers f01/r01 (Lorenz et al., 1995). Five µl of the
PCR  products  were  analyzed  by  electrophoresis  in
1.5%  agarose  gel  in  TAE  buffer  (40  mM Tris-acetate,
1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) in presence of 0.5 µg ml-1 ethidi-

um bromide. Ten µl of the PCR products were digested
separately  with  SspI  and  BsaAI  according  to  the  mani-
facturer’s  instructions  (BioLabs).  Restriction  fragments
were  resolved  in  a  5%  polyacrylamide  gel.  After  elec-
trophoresis,  the  DNA  was  stained  with  silver  nitrate.
Amplified DNA obtained from AP-infected apple trees
and PD-infected pear trees was used for comparison in
RFLP analyses.

RESULTS

Natural  host/sources  of C.  pruni.  During  March
and April, overwintering adults of C. pruni were mostly

237

captured on ‘Myrobalan’ suckers and plum trees. Some
were  also  captured  from  apricot  trees,  but  none  were
found  on  cherry,  peach,  pear  or  apple  trees.  The  first
captures  of  hibernating  adults  from  stone  fruit  trees
were  made  at  the  beginning  of  March.  In  May  large
populations of nymphs were present, expecially on ‘My-
robalan’.

Test  insects  and  phytoplasma  transmission.  Over-
wintering adults captured in spring survived in captivi-
ty for up to 2 months. The average survival during the
inoculation  access  periods  was  above  90%.  Judging
from  the  large  colonies  of  offspring,  the  females  were
very  fertile  and  the  general  rearing  conditions  were
suitable.

In the first trial 2240 adults of C. pruni were caught
in the field and used to inoculate 21 test plants. When
analyzed  by  DAPI  and  PCR,  17  of  these  plants  were
phytoplasma-infected  (Table  1).  More  particularly,  13
out of 16 and 4 out of 5 test plants became infected af-
ter  being  inoculated  in  spring  by  overwintering  adults
of C. pruni or nymphs and young adults born from eggs
(new generation), respectively.

All 17 test plants of the second experiment (Table 2)
became infected after exposure to infectious psyllas, ei-
ther  adults  or  nymphs  hatched  in  cages.  Transmission
efficiency of adults and nymphs was similar.

The  negative  results  of  PCR  analyses  indicated  that
none  of  the  six  groups  of  the  ESFY-P  infected  psyllas
transmitted to pear or apple test plants. Similarly, nega-
tive  results  were  obtained  when  PD-infected  C.  pyri
were transferred to ‘Ozark Premier’ test plants.

Phytoplasma detection. DAPI tests and PCR analy-
ses  gave  the  same  results.  Using  primer  pair  fO1/rO1,
ESFY-P  DNA  was  amplified  from  all  samples  from
sources  of  inoculum  as  well  as  from  89%  of  the  test
plants  used  in  inoculative  feeding,  and  from  the  8
groups  of  infectious  psyllas  tested.  After  the  digestion
with SspI and BsaAI, the PCR products obtained from
samples of psylla and Japanese plum always showed the
same  restriction  profiles,  distinguishable  from  AP  and
PD profiles (Fig. 1).

Disease  development.  Four  to  five  months  after  in-
oculation, the first symptoms of ESFY appeared on the
‘Ozark Premier’ test plants. They consisted of faint but
typical  leaf  reddening,  small  leaves,  irregular  leafing,
leafroll and thickening of the leaf blade. The partial de-
foliation  of  several  plants  was  attributable  to  insect
feeding damage rather than to the disease. 

Fig.  1. SspI  (lanes  4-7)  and  BsaAI  (lanes  8-11)  restriction  profiles  of
16S  rDNA  amplified  with  primer  pair  f01/r01.  The  template  DNA
was from: ESFYp infected Japanese plum (lanes 4 and 8); ESFYp in-
fected  C.  pruni (lanes  5  and  9);  AP  infected  apple  tree  (lanes  6  and
10); PD infected pear tree (lanes 7 and 11). The lanes 1-3 are undige-
sted  DNA  respectively  from  ESFYp  infected  Japanese  plum  (1),
AP infected apple tree (2) and PD infected pear tree (3). M: marker
(Bio Rad).

DISCUSSION 

The results show that C. pruni is a vector of the Eu-
ropean  stone  fruit  yellows  agent.  Following  digestion
with  SspI  and  BsaAI,  all  samples  (symptomatic  inocu-
lum  sources,  groups  of  psylla,  and  symptomatic  test
plants)  consistently  showed  the  same  restriction  pro-
files, which were identical to those of ESFY isolated on
Catharanthus roseus by dodder (Loi et al., 1995).

The  data  in  Table  2  show  the  ability  of  C.  pruni to
transmit ESFY from infected to healthy plum trees un-
der  controlled  conditions.  In  fact  the  vectors  used  for
transmission were raised from eggs layed on the experi-
mentally  infected  plum  trees.  The  young  adults  and
nymphs  were  then  removed  from  these  trees  and  used
for  separate  inoculation  experiments.  It  is  largely  ac-
cepted that vertical (=transovarial) transmission of phy-
toplasmas in their vector is an exception rather than the
rule (Purcell, 1982).

The transmission efficiency of the groups of C. pruni
caught in nature and transferred to infect the test plants
(Table  1)  was  comparable  to  that  of  insects  reared  on
ESFY-infected  ‘Ozark  Premier’ plants  in  controlled
greenhouse conditions (Table 2). This indicates that C.
pruni is not only an experimental vector of ESFY-P but
also  a  natural  vector.  Furthermore,  C.  pruni did  not
transmit ESFY to apple or pear test plants specific for
AP  and  PD,  nor  did  C.  pyri transmit  PD  to  Prunus.
These data suggest that the three diseases are caused by
different  phytoplasmas.  In  fact  the  agents  of  AP,  PD,
and ESFY are considered to be closely related but dis-

tinct,  all  belonging  to  the  apple  proliferation  cluster
(Seemüller et al., 1998). 

The  data  obtained  underline  the  biological  similari-
ties between ESFY and PD and AP: the natural spread
of ESFY and PD are both mediated by Cacopsylla spp.;
recently in our laboratory the AP agent was also detect-
ed  in  Cacopsylla spp.  (Carraro  et  al.,  unpublished  re-
sults).  ESFY  and  PD  are  host  species-specific  and  we
have  found  no  cases  of  mixed  infection,  either  in  the
host plants or in the psylla vectors. In conclusion, in the
rather  typical  area  studied,  where  AP,  PD  and  ESFY
spread  naturally  and  are  present  in  the  same  orchard,
the three diseases are clearly distinct.

Our results show that both nymphs and adults of C.
pruni can  transmit  ESFY  but  we  do  not  know  yet
whether  in  nature  the  overwintering  adults  found  in
spring can carry over infection from the previous year.
The  important  question  remains,  whether  infectivity
may persist from spring to spring in psyllas, without in-
termediate  reacquisition  (recharging)  (Sylvester  and
Osler, 1977). The potential influence of alternative host
plants is also unknown.

On  the  basis  of  the  positive  transmissions  by  the
groups  of  psylla  born  in  spring  on  stone  fruit  trees
(Table 1, groups 17-21) we can assume that in nature C.
pruni can  acquire  infectivity  from  infected  stone  fruit
trees  before  abandoning  these  principal  hosts.  Our  re-
sults show that in spring all insects can be infectious, in-
cluding    those  found  on  the  principal  host  after  over-
wintering and those of the spring generation on infect-
ed stone fruit trees.

We emphasize that the vector of ESFY-P was found
in an area of organic farming where insect populations
are not influenced by use of insecticides.

Further  investigations  are  necessary  to  study  the
main transmission parameters of ESFY and the life cy-
cle  of  the  vector.  It  will  be  necessary  to  rear  a  phyto-
plasma-free colony of C. pruni, taking into account that
this psylla is oligofagous on Prunus, overwinters on wild
plants such as conifers and has a single generation per
year (Conci et al., 1992).
