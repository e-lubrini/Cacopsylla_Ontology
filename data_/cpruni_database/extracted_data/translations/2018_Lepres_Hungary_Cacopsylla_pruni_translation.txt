'Plant Protection Institute of St. Stephen's University, H-2100 Gi
Plant Protection Institute of the Center for Agricultural Research of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,
H-1022 Budapest, Herman Ott tit 15. The plum psyllid is a vector for the European Stone Fruit Yellows (ESFY), a disease that presently
is the most important factor to endanger apricot production. Neither the life cycle nor the spatial
distribution of this species is completely understood. Since the number of surveys is the psyllid
vector is especially low in Hungary, we aimed to examine the reasons behind the dieback of trees in
an apricot orchard where dieback is especially expressed, and ESFY is suspected among the main
causes. Individuals of C. pruni were collected according to the Integrated Pest Control Survey Sheet
issued for use in national, authorized surveys. Trees of the orchard were visually sampled and ranked
according to a scale set up especially for our purposes. Vector and plant samples were identified at
the Plant Protection Institute of the Center for Agricultural Research of the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences. Our study demonstrated the presence of the plum psyllid. A total of 114 individuals were
collected, and 35% of those female and male adults and nymphs alike, contained ’Ca. Phytoplasma
prunorum ’, the phytoplasma of the disease. During the studied vegetation period, no correlation
or trend was found between time and the level of infection. We found, however, that individuals of
the orchard plum psyllid population homogenously belong to biotype B. The infection of sampled
trees and rootstock suckers were also confirmed. Keywords: Cacopsylla pruni, European Stone Fruit Yellows, ESFY, apricot
