Vill. A LIST OF PHE IRISH HEMIPTERA (HETEROPTERA AND
CICADINA). By J. N. HALBERT, M.R.1L.A. {Bewe Tae Twentiera Rerort rrom THE Fauna AND Fora ComMrrree.) (Read 12 Novempen, 1934. Published 4 January, 1935.] INTRODUCTION. Tue following paper is an attempt to bring together for the first time
information on two groups of the Irish Hemiptera, with the main object
of supplying as accurate a list as possible of the species found in this
country. It also serves to fill many gaps in the known range of these

insects. The Hemiptera are an order of suctorial insects which have been
grouped by entomologists in two sections. They are (1) the Heteroptera
in whieh the bases of the fore-wings are of a firmer texture than the
terminal membranous parts, comprising mainly the plant and water-bugs;
(2) the Homoptera having the fore-wings of a uniform texture ; these include
the Cicadina or Froghoppers, the Aphids, and the Scale Insects. The
present report is concerned with the Heteroptera, the Cicadina, and allied
iorms. Our knowledge of the Heteroptera is the more complete, and in the case
of these insects it has been decided to give as full details as possible. This
seems justified, as apart from the work involved in collecting and identifying
specimens, most of the localities and at least fifty of the species are
unrecorded from Ireland; among the latter are many rare or local insects,
such as Thyreocoris scarabacoides Linn., Corizus hyalinus Fabr., Ischno-
coris sabuleti Fall., Salda morio Zett., Poeciloscytus palustris Reut., and
Notonecta marmorea viridis Dele. It was at first intended to omit the
Homoptera, as the available information on these insects is scanty. In
order, however, to make the report more useful for reference a list-of the
Trish species has been added (see page 307), with notes on the rarer forms. A brief survey of what has been published may be of interest. The
earliest note that I have been able to trace is by Curtis in reference to the
finding of Microvelia by Haliday at Holywood in 1838. With the
exception of a few scattered records there is then a gap until 1878 when
Dr. J- A. Power, r.u.s., recorded a list of species found in the Waterford
and Dublin districts. This list by one of the leading entomologists of his
time may be regarded as accurate. Two of the species have not since been
found in Ireland, they are Capsus capillaris Fabr. and Brysoptera rufifrons

212 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. In 1892 ‘‘The Hemiptera H. of the British Islands,’”’ by E. Saunders,
¥.LS., appeared, the first modern work on the subject. He mentions
about forty Irish species the majority of which were found by A. H.
Haliday many years ago. This list was supplied by Dr. G. H. Carpenter,
M.R.LA., who was then in charge of the insect collections in the Irish
National Museum. On the publication of the ‘‘Irish Naturalist’’ (1892) there was a marked
inerease in natural history’ work, and many records on the group find a
place in its pages. The Rev. W. F. Johnson, M.a., was a contributor to
whom most of our information on the Hemiptera of the northern counties
is due; and also the late C. W. Buckle, who collected in the Belfast and
Lough Foyle districts. During the valuable work done on the Clare Island Survey, organized
by Dr. R. Lloyd Praeger, m.n.1.4., the Hemiptera received a good deal of
attention, one hundred and seventy-two species are recorded from western
Mayo in the Proceedings of this Academy. Reference should also be made
to the work of the Irish Field Clubs, especially on their visits to the
Kenmare, Galway, and Sligo districts. The late E. A. Butler’s ‘‘Biology of the British Heteroptera’ was
published in 1923 in which there are many references to Irish species,
though, as in the case of Saunders, no definite localities are mentioned. The information given on the subject of distribution was of great use in
the preparation of this report. A. H. Haliday formed a collection of Hemiptera, the remains of which,
as well as his MS. list of Irish insects, are now in the National Musetm. It is clear, however, that the Hemiptera had not the same attraction for
this distinguished entomologist as had other insects, notably the
Hymenoptera and the Diptera, and he published little on the group. Unfortunately, as in many old-time collections the Haliday specimens are
as a rule unlocalized, and where Irish species were concerned he was
content with indicating that they had been found in this country. Originally there were many species which had not been noticed since his
time; these have now been rediscovered with the exception of five, ie.,
Corizus parwmpunctatus Schill., Heterogaster urticae Fabr., Peritrechus
geniculatus Hahn., Orthostira nigrina Fall., and Lophus flavomarginatus
Don. Mr. E. Bullock has collected a good many of these insects in the
Killarney district, a notable discovery being the winged form of
Pachycoleus rufescens J. Sahlb. ; he has also paid special attention to the
genus Corixa, and I am indebted to him for a useful list of his captures,
among which C. dentipes Thoms., and C. cavifrons Thoms., are of interest. It is now many years since the writer began to work at the Irish

Hemiptera. For long they were collected in a more or less casual way
when in search of other orders, a method which does not lead to the best
results, as the Hemiptera are of fragile structure and need care in their
preservation. During more recent years visits were made to promising
districts, especially in the late summer and autumn months, when these
inseets received special attention, and a good deal of information was
gained chiefly in the sonthern counties. In this work he has much
pleasure in acknowledging the help given by the Fauna and Flora
Committee of this Academy, without which the report would have been
much more incomplete than it is. The present state of our knowledge of the Irish Heteroptera is such
that I believe we have now a fair idea of the nature of our fauna as far
as the species which occur here are concerned. On the other hand, their
local range within the country is in many cases but little known, and
much work remains to be done in this respect, especially in northern
and midland districts. On comparing our fauna with that of Great Britain we find a difference
in the relative numbers of species similar to what has been observed in
other groups of insects. There are now 485 species of Heteroptera
recorded from the British Isles, and only 253 are known to occur in
Ireland. While it is certain that additional species will be found, I do
not believe that this numerical difference between the faunas is likely to
be much altered by future work. The following table of families giving the comparative numbers of
species occurring in Great Britain,? Scotland, and Ireland will help to
show where the differences are most marked :—

214 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. The poverty of the Scotch and Irish faunas in the families Pentato-
midae, and especially in the Coreidae, also in the Lygaeidae, Tingidae,
and Cimicidae, will be noticed. The fact is, these families are rich in
species that have a more or less southern range in the British Isles, and
the great majority do not reach Scotland. The somewhat richer Irish
fauna in these families also accounts for the difference in the Scotch
and Irish lists. The Corixidae are aquatic insects, and the relatively
higher number of species may be expected in forms which are known to
be very widely and uniformly distributed where suitable ecological
conditions exist. It is of interest to compare these figures with what occurs in othér
orders of insects. In the coleoptera, for instance, approximately 3,590
species are found in Great Britain and 1,900 in Ireland, relatively the
same proportion that we find in the Hemiptera. Among sun-loving insects
there are the butterflies, according to South, ‘‘The entire number of
species that can by any means be regarded as British does not exceed
sixty-eight.” We have records of about 42 native species, a higher
percentage which may in part be due to the attention given to these
popular insects. With regard to the Hymenoptera, Mr. A. W. Stelfox
records 158 species of ants, bees, and wasps (omitting the families
Chrysididae and Bethylidae) as against 425 British species, a low average
for which reasons are given in his excellent report on these insects. *
Apparently the most that can be expected in Ireland is from about one-
half to two-thirds of the British fauna in some groups. While it is possible that new species or varieties may yet be found in
unexplored districts, it would seem that isolation has had small effect on
the Irish Hemipterous fauna. As far as we are aware there are no
endemic species, and of the few which are claimed to be endemic in Great
Britain only one—Myrmedobia inconspicua D. & S.—has been found in
Ireland. Two insular British varieties occur: these are Calocoris vi-guttatus
var. insularis Reut., which is the only form found here, and the pale
ochreous variety maculicollis M. & R., of Camptozygum pinastri Fall. There is a tendency to melanism, as in the genus Poeciloscytus, where the
pale coloured P. unifasciatus Fabr. is represented in Ireland by P. palustris
Reut. ; a melanie tendency is also noticeable in Corixa, especially in
specimens from highland districts. It is now believed that the paucity of species in the Irish fauna as
compared with that of Great Britain is due more to past geological
changes resulting in the isolation of the areas concerned than to ecological
factors such as of climate and soil. Problems of geographical distri-
bution are thus involved. The writer does not wish to enter on this
difficult subject, which has been so admirably dealt with in recent years,

except in so far as some notes on the distribution of the Irish Hemiptera
may be of interest to those engaged in this special study. As in all
groups of insects, the bulk of our hemipterous fauna is made up of species
which are common and generally distributed in the British Isles and
over wide areas of the Palearctic Region. Apart from these widespread forms of uncertain origins a southern
and a northern group can be recognized without difficulty. The former
is the more interesting: it comprises species which we have reason to
believe are confined to our southern counties, their northern limit being
approximately the Dublin and Galway line. Among these are some of
wide range in the south, such are Lurygaster testudinaria Geoff., Palomena
prasina Linn., and Syromastes marginatus Linn. There are also in this
group a number of species found only in our south-eastern districts; some
of these are of very local occurrence, and they mainly inhabit the coast. In the aggregate their range extends from the Cork district to north
Wicklow; as example attention may be drawn to T'yrecoris scarabacoides
Linn., Stenocephalus agilis Seop., Therapha hyoscyami Linn., Ischnodemus
sabuleti Fall., Nabis lineatus Dahlb., Myrmedobia inconspicua D. & S.,*
Adelphocaris seticornis Fabr., and Notonecta marmorea viridis Dele. It
is in this group that we find a few species which are of south-west European
origin, notably the Tyreocoris, the Myrmedobia, and the Notonecta, all
of which occur on the dunes at Ballyteige on the Wexford coast. The
interesting Aepophilus bonnairei Sign., which lives between high and low
water on the sea shore, is also of south-western origin with a wider Irish
range than the species just referred to, as it is found also on the west
coast of Ireland. It would thus appear that in the Hemiptera there is a
group of species of south-west European origin confined in their Irish
range to the south-east rather than to the south-west, where we might expect
them to occur. In the case of xerophilous insects, such as the Tyreocoris and the
Myrmedobia, it is probable that the drier conditions of south-eastern
Ireland may have been the deciding factor in their local distribution. Judging by their continental range, a considerable number of species
must have entered the Irish area while it still formed part of north-
western Europe; among these are some interesting northern and alpine
forms of which the following may be mentioned :—Drymus piceus Flor.,
Pachycoleus rufescens Sahl. (Alpine), Salda morio Zett., Acalypta nigrina
Fall., Teratocoris viridis D. & S., and Coriza cavifrons Thoms. They
occur mainly in western districts as far south as Kerry, where they are
well represented. In most cases it will be found that the general distri-
bution of the insects referred to in these notes is very wide; in fact, there
are few, even amongst our rarest British Hemiptera, that have a really
restricted continental range. «Found only in southern Britain, and consequently of south-west European range. This content downloaded from. 138.123 on Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:

in Britain and the Irish specimens that I have seen are E. testudinaria
Geoff., so it may be that Z. maura Linn. is not an Irish species. Four of
the above-mentioned records are based on the occurrence of the larva,
these are referred provisionally to the present species. In all probability
the following records of £. maura Linn., of which the specimens are not
available should also refer Z. testudinaria, Caragh Lake (Yerbury) Distant

numbers in a disused limestone quarry at Kilmaeshane’’ 8/’02, Turner ’03. E. testudinaria is of local oceurrence in the south of Ireland; it does
not seem to range farther north than the County Wicklow, frequenting
marshy places, also meadows and dry quarries, from July to September. On one occasion it was on Phragmites in an estuarine marsh with Zicrona
caerulea Linn., and one of our rarer beetles Donacia braccata Scop. The
Srish specimens do not show much variation, they are larger than types
cf E. maura that I have seen, and Mr. China has observed the same in
English specimens. ‘‘On the continent EZ. testudinaria is usually smaller
than EZ. maura, This may mean that our British specimens represent a
distinct subspecies.’? Both of these insects are found in the south of
England, and the present species is the more widely distributed, ranging
as far west as Cornwall. Tyreocoris scarabaeoides Linn. WX. Ballyteige Burrows on the Wexford coast near Kilmore Quay:

a close growth of ground moss among which the insects tried to hide on

frequenting glades in woodland districts, meadows, river banks, and way-
side hedges; hawthorn and bramble when in fruit are favoured food-plants. During the early summer months the adults and numbers of the larvae
may be found, the former being survivals from the autumn brood of the
previous year. The newly emerged adults appear in the beginning of
September. Common in the south of England and the Continental range
is very wide. [Chlorochroa juniperina Linn. Lough Hyne: Salt marsh, Renouf ’34. The identification of the single

that the insect may be Palomena prasina Linn., which has been found in

localities, as I have noticed in the extensive marshes at Youghal and Water-
ford; this may have something to do with an abundance of suitable prey,
as the insect is known to be carnivorous. ‘‘The insects of the year attain
maturity during the late summer months, and may be found in the open
till October, when they retire for the winter, finding shelter under low
bushes or amongst grass or dead leaves. They appear in the open again
in March and April, and from then on to October the imago may be

that this record should be verified by the capture of the adult insect. The late Dr. Power’s collections are now in the British Museum, and
there is no trace of a Waterford specimen in the series of Rhacognathus,
it is seareely likely, however, that there can have been an error in this
record. Widely distributed in Britain, ‘‘though never common,’’
ranging from Cornwall to Lough Rannock in Scotland. It has been
found among heather, in moss, and on low-growing plants rather than
on trees. This content downloaded from. 194.254.138.123 on Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:59:01 UTC

preceding species in being rarer in the adult stage; as a rule only one
or two specimens are found at a time. The only Ulster record is of the
Jarvae at Tollymore Park, and as they were identified by Saunders there
ean be no question of the species. Apparently the insect matures rather
early in the summer months as compared with other Pentatomidae; it has
been found as late as November in this country. The Continental distri-

one might suspect an error. The Haliday specimens are undoubtedly
C. tristriatus Fabr. Butler mentions a number of plants, including Pinus
and Abies, on which this species has been found: ‘‘Many of these, no
doubt, are mere casual occurrences, and there is little doubt that juniper,
or at most some of the Pinaceae, constitutes the true food-plant on which
the young are reared and the life-cycle is enacted. Curtis speaks of
finding it on larch trees at the end of August.’’ Recorded from several

County Wicklow, and probably the western range is more extensive than
these records indicate. It may be found in numbers in favoured places
such as meadows, river margins, and embankments, where there is an
abundance of flowering plants, especially meadow sweet (Spiraea), for
which it seems to have a great liking. The larva may be found well into the
month of August; the adults of the year mature at the end of that month,
and in September. The British range of this species is distinctly southern,
Cornwall to Oxon, Berks, Surrey, and Suffolk; and in the west as far as
north Wales. Mr. Butler believes that the insect is less common than
formerly. On the Continent the distribution is very wide, ranging across
Northern and Central Europe to Japan. This content downloaded from. 194.254.138.123 on Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:59:01 UTC

its range are Rosscarbery in west Cork and the Magherabeg sandhills in
County Wicklow. The insect frequents sand-banks and old-established
dunes, and may sometimes be found in numbers especially where the spurge
(Euphorbia) and the restharrow (Ononis) are plentiful. It runs with
great rapidity when disturbed from the shelter of the plants. Adults have
been found from May to September, some appearing towards the end of the
latter month. I-have noticed larvae in the last instar on the 18th
September on the Arklow sandhills. S. agilis is of southern range in
England, including south Wales, and there is a doubtful record of its
eceurrence in Scotland. Abroad it is widely distributed in Central and
Southern Europe, extending into Siberia, Asia Minor, and Northern Africa. Therapha hyoscyami Linn. WX. Cahore sandhills: 10/7/’27. Kilgorman sandhills: 21/7/’27

sandy sea coasts and seems to favour the restharrow (Ononis arvensis) on
which it is not as conspicuous as the red and black colouring would lead
one to expect, especially in dull weather. At the Ballyteige dunes and
Greystones, which mark the limits of its range, a close search was necessary
for the capture of a few specimens on Ononis. The adults are known to
hibernate among moss and in evergreen trees such as pines and junipers. “It was formerly taken on the coast sands near Yarmouth, being found,
though rarely, on Ononis. Almost all the other records, however, are from
the south and west.’’ Widely distributed in the Palearctic Region, where,
in contrast with the British habitats, it is found in many inland places. Corizus parumpunctatus Schill. Treland (Haliday), Johnson ’94,

There is a much injured specimén of this species in the Haliday
collection marked as found in Ireland; as far as I am aware there are no
subsequent captures. It seems to be the most widely distributed species
of the genus in Great Britain. Corizus hyalinus Fabr. NK. Killarney: a single specimen found in the Kenmare Demesne,
29/5/’23! (Bullock). DU. Portmarnock: 27/6/’03 (H.). Apparently a rare and unrecorded species of which only two specimens
have been found in Ireland. At Portmarnock it occurred by sweeping a
grassy bank close to the sea shore. On a visit to Mr. E. Bullock he Showed
me a Corizus which is certainly this species, it was taken by sweeping
plants in a wood where the Denagh River flows from Lough Leane. It is
of interest that Mr. Butler also records only two British specimens, one
at a marshy place near Gosfield in Surrey and the other at Norwich; both
of these were found in the same year (1903) as my Portmarnock specimen,
which suggests that the insects may have reached these islands by flight. Mr. Butler refers to this possibility in his notes on the distribution of
the species: ‘‘On the Continent it is mainly a southern species, belonging
chiefly to the countries round the Mediterranean ; but it oceurs also in most
of the great zoological provinces, being recorded from S. Africa, and North
end Central America.’’ He suggests that the enlarged wing membrane
of this species may have something to do with its wide range. Family I1I—BERYTIDAE. Neides tipularis Linn. DU. Portrane: adults and Jarvae, 16/9/’27 (H.). The only locality known to me for this unrecorded species is the sea

in the same district and also on the neighbouring Magherabeg dunes. The
occurrence of this species on sandhills. is of interest; in England and else-
where it is found in damp places at the roots of rushes, and it may live
under these conditions on a marsh adjacent to the Arklow dunes. On a
sunny day in July I have found the larvae and adults in numbers crawling
among the marram grass on the hot sand. Most of the specimens were
brachypterous, but there were also a few of the fully-winged form. Apparently this is rare. Mr. Butler refers to specimens in the Power and
Douglas collections found many years ago. This species is very local;
“it belongs to the south-eastern corner of England, and has occurred in
five counties: Herts, Essex, Kent, Surrey, and Berks.’’ Widespread in
Central and Southern Europe. Chilacis typhae Perr. DU. Portmarnock: 1/6/'25 (H.). Kilbarrack Pits: 2/10/’26! (O’Mahony). Found in heads of the reed-mace (Typha latifolia) in weed-grown ponds

Hants to Cumberland, and on the Continent it is found chiefly in Central
Europe. Rhyparochromus dilatatus H. S.

NK. Rossbeigh: 6/’02 (Donisthorpe), Sawnders ’03. This is the only Irish record, and the species may possibly be confined
to the south-west. In Great Britain it is found “mainly on the east coast
and the country south of the Thames.’’ Central and Southern Europe. Rhyparochromus chiragra Fabr. Ireland (Haliday Collection). DU. Malahide sandhills: adults and
larvae in final instar, 30/7/’17 (H.). Found among ground-moss on the Malahide dunes, apparently the only
capture of the species in Ireland since Haliday’s time. It was at first
thought that these specimens were the sandhill variety sabulicola Thoms. They are really a variety in which all the tibiae are ochreous with dark
apices, and the third antennal segment is black. Mr. China tells me there
are specimens from the London district in the British Museum collection
agreeing perfectly with those from Malahide, so it is not an Irish form
of the species. The variety sabulicola is narrower in shape, and the second
and third tibiae are entirely fulvous. An early stage of the larva has been described by Butler; those found
at Malahide are evidently in the final instar stage, of which the following
isa short description :—

Length about 5 mm. ; the head, pronotum, and wing-pads are black
and pilose, and the abdomen is a dark ferruginous colour. Pronotum
trapezoidal, somewhat transverse, and margined. Antennae shorter and
relatively stouter than in the adult, with the first two segments ochreous. The legs are entirely ochreous; anterior femora with a sharp tooth on the
underside. R. chiragra is apparently the commonest species of the genus in Britain. Ischnocoris angustulus Boh. WC. Glengarriff: 13/7/'24 (H.). The habitat in which this species occurs at Glengarriff is unusual,
under a sparse growth of moss in small hollows of partly exposed boulders;
it was in company with another hemipteron Notochilus contractus H.S.,
a species of rare occurrence in Ireland. In this habitat there was also an
interesting association of ants, spiders, centipedes, and other small animals. I suspect the Ischnocoris had wandered from the heather which also partly
covered the boulders where there was sufficient foothold. In the Dublin
district I have found Macrodema micropterum Curt. and Myrmedobia
tenella Zett. in a similar habitat. Although unrecorded from Ireland the

in the larval forms of British hemiptera, had no knowledge of the early
stages of this species. A short description of a larva, which appears to be
in the third instar, is given here. Larva.—Length about 2°50 mm. The head, pronotum, and wing-pads,
are of a dark brown colour, very shiny, even more so than in the adult. The pronotum is somewhat broader than long, the front margin is at least
three-quarters as long as the proximal margin, and there is no trace of the
strong basal punctures found in the adult. Wing-pads longer than the
pronotum, with straight lateral margins, widened towards the ends. The
abdomen is bright red with very small dorsal plates, and the antennae
and legs are of a uniform yellowish-brown colour. The species has a wide Continental range, and in England it has been
found as far north as Norfolk and Cheshire, inhabiting. sandy places both
on the coast and inland. Acompus rufipes Wolff. WA. Cappoquin: 15/8/’28! (Stelfox). Mr. A. W. Stelfox found a single specimen in a quarry on the bank of

moss at the roots of heather in the Kenmare Demesne on 12th July, so
that this is evidently the month in which the insects of the year mature. These larvae were of a yellowish-brown colour during life, the dise of the
pronotum and the dorsal plates being darker. The insect has a wide
range in Great Britain and in Northern and Central Europe. Drymus piceus Flor. NK. Killarney: in the Muckross Demesne, 4/9/’25 (H.). In view of its northern range and the abundance of suitable localities,
Mr. Butler comments on the absence of this insect from Ireland. It is
satisfactory therefore to record its occurrence at Killarney, where it was
not infrequent amongst dead leaves and rushes in marshy places in the
Kenmare Demesne during September. Mr. E. Bullock has also found it
in the same district. The species is widely distributed, but very local in
Great Britain extending into Scotland, and as regards its Continental
range, ‘‘it appears to be entirely a northern species, being recorded from
France, Scandinavia, N, Russia, and Siberia.’’

238 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Acalypta nigrina Fall. Ireland (Haliday collection). Unrecorded as an Irish species and finds a place here on the strength
of a specimen collected in Ireland many years ago by A. H. Haliday. This specimen is in a fair state of preservation considering that it dates
from the early part of the last century. As has happened with so many
of Haliday’s captures, there is little doubt its rediscovery is only a matter
of time. This is a northern species. ‘‘Occurs in Northern and Central
Europe and in Italy and the Crimea. It has been observed as far north
at lat. 70° in Finland. In Britain, apart from the. . ‘omerset record
and one from Oxon (Collins), it has occurred in Scotland only, in
Morayshire and at Aviemore.”’

south, west, and east coasts of Ireland. The first recorded Irish specimen
was found by the late A. R. Nichols at Dungarvan in the year 1897. Some
years later Messrs. Tattersall and Kemp met with it during their work on
the marine fauna of the west coast of Ireland. In the Ballinakill and
Tawin localities the insects were between tide-marks in the cavities of
stones that had been bored by the molluse Saxicava (Tattersall). One of
the most characteristic habitats is at Malahide near Dublin where it lives
in rock fissures in the Fucus serratus zone. On forcing open one of
these fissures ‘‘It will be noticed that, although covered twice a day by
the tides, the freshly exposed surfaces are not saturated with water, but
are just moist, or in the higher zones fairly dry, and in the favoured
places are peopled by a variety of insects, mites, and other animals. There may be found large colonies of the common shore spring-tail
Anurida maritima, with myriads of their cast skins in a dry condition,
and attendant predaceous mites, beetles (Aepus, Diglotta, Micralymma),
and false scorpions (Obisium maritimum).’’® Renouf records it from a
similar rock-fissure habitat at Lough Hyne on the Cork coast where it is
covered by from eight to twelve feet of water at high spring-tides. ‘Halbert. Proc. Roy. Irish Acad., xxxv, 109 (1920). This content downloaded from. 194.254.138.123 on Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:59:01 UTC

Though probably of wider Continental range than is at present known
(coasts of France and Spain) Aepophilus is evidently of south-western
origin. ‘‘The distribution of this species, although largely limited by
ecological factors connected with respiration, supplies some evidence of
the former existence of a continuous shore line between Brittany and the
west coast of Ireland’’ (China ’30). In England it has been found only
on the south coast in the counties of Hants, Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall. Hydrometra stagnorum Linn. SK. Kenmare: 7/’98, H.’98. NK. Dingle: 5/’94 (H.). Caragh Lake:

in Ireland.. The species is a large and conspicuous one, not easily over-
Jooked, yet it was not until April, 1929, that my friend Mr. E. Bullock
had the good fortune to find it in a bog-cutting close to Lough Guitane in
ihe Killarney district. It is possible that this may be the very place where
Haliday found his specimens, as it is known he made an entomological
jour in the south of Ireland in the year 1855. According to Butler this species is rare in Britain, frequenting ponds
during March and April in at least five counties ranging from Sussex to
Cumberland, it has also been found in Scotland (Pitlochry). The
Continental range is very wide, including Europe, Siberia, and the Nearctic
Region. [Gerris paludum Fabr. ‘‘Ardara’’: Johnson ’93. This record, and consequently the species, must be deleted from the
Irish list. Mr. Butler’s reference ‘‘North of Ireland’’ is probably from the
same source. It is hardly likely that this species occurs in Ireland. With
the exception of a few outlying localities in Britain, ‘‘Its chief home
appears to be the compact area of the five counties south of the Thames
from Berks and Hants to Kent.’’ Northern and Central Europe.] Gerris najas De G.

moorland districts from April to September. There are no records from
the south of Ireland, but I should say it will eventually be found there,

Treland are, with one exception, referable to the following species, it
seemed possible there was an error in the Waterford record. Dr. Power’s
collections are now in the British Museum, and Mr. W. 5. China tells me
there is a specimen of P. vagabunda labelled ‘‘Waterford’’ amongst the
Hemiptera. Widespread in Britain, occurring on tree trunks, palings,
n eut pine branches, and it is frequently found on houses. Ploiariola culiciformis De G.

Acton Glebe, Poyntzpass, one flew in at a window and alighted on a book
Mr. Johnson was reading. One of Mr. Stelfox’s specimens was found in
a bath in March; he suggests it was probably hibernating in the roof and
got blown down by a storm. ‘‘In Britain its distribution appears to be
much more restricted than that of P. vagabunda.”’

NABIS. The species of the genus Nabis are conspicuous and widely distributed
insects, and they are well represented in Ireland. Thus, of the eleven
recorded British species eight are found in this country; one of these,
N. lineatus Dahlb., oceurs only in the south-eastern districts. The three
remaining British species, N. apterus Fabr., N. boops Schiddte, and
N. brevis Scholtz, are mainly of southern range and are scarcely likely

to occur in Ireland. [22]

coasts, sea banks, and also in dry places inland, such as embankments and
gravel pits. The larvae are to be found from early July to September,
the adults at the end of August and also in September. This species in
its early larval stages is found associated with ants. I noticed this
especially on the south cliff at Howth, where it was in company with the
black ant, Formica fusca. The insects were under clumps of Matricaria
and running actively together on the sea banks, when the superficial
resemblance to the ants was very noticeable. The winged form of the adult
is rare; I have found it on the Arklow sandhills in September. LZ. lati-
ventris is widely distributed in Great Britain, but it does not seem to
occur in Scotland. Nabis major Cost. EC. Youghal: 8/’33 (H.). KK. Imistioge: 8/°02, Turner ’03. Glenmore: 9/29 (H.). WX. Wexford: meadow by Slaney, 8/725. Ballyteige under Ononis on sandhills, 8/’31 (H.). WI. Arklow : sandhills,

are found, and on the maturing of the adults in the autumn months it is
sometimes locally common, as at Ballyteige and Arklow sands and at other

more or less common where it occurs. I have usually found it by sweeping
rushes (Juncus) from July to September. The adult stage is reached in
the early part of August. The winged form has not been found in this
country, and it seems to be of great rarity in Britain, Mr. Butler knew
of only one specimen taken in a salt marsh in Suffolk in 1904. N. lineatus

Gilly : in moss, January (Johnson). A common species during the summer and autumn months. The
prevalent Irish form is rather dark in colour, due to the wing nervures
being more or less margined with grey; a slightly larger and paler form
also occurs. Although the species is short winged, I have found a few
specimens in which the elytra and the membrane are distinctly longer
than in the average and the whole insect is narrower. This form is
probably the same as one recorded from England by Butler with the wing
membrane more developed. Nabis ericetorum Scholtz. SK. Kenmare: 7/°98, H.’98. NK. Caragh Lake: 8/’26! (Bullock). WC. Glengarriff: 19/7/’24 (H.). Lough Hyne: in salt marsh, Renouf

colouring found in typical ericetorum Scholtz., and closely resembling
the darker form of N. rugosus mentioned above. Mr. W. E. China, to
whom I referred this variety, remarks: ‘‘Your specimens are the pale form
of N. ericetorum Scholtz., which we have in our collection from Cornwall
only. Their occurrence in Ireland and Cornwall suggests that they might
be a subspecies belonging to the Lusitanian faunal element, but I can find
no real difference from typical ericetorum.’’ The localities in which I have

Salda morio Zett. SL. Ballymote: 14/7/92! (Jameson). The only known Irish specimen was found by the late H. Lyster
Jameson near Ballymote many years ago, probably in a moorland locality. The Dublin record of S. morio Zett. (H.’94c) should refer to S. oculata
Mull., which was not then known as a British species. As the insect is
rare, Mr. Butler’s remarks on its distribution are of interest. ‘‘It is
recorded from Ireland, Northern and Central Europe, and Siberia, besides
Great Britain. Its distribution in our own country is difficult to state
accurately, because of the confusion that for some time existed between
this and the preceding. The present species has certainly been taken in
Northumberland, Cumberland, Durham, Derbyshire, and Ireland.”’

toria is sometimes a matter of difficulty; the character of the three bars
as opposed to a continuous stripe on the front tibiae is often indistinetly
marked and may lead to error. Mr. W. E. China has lately been working
on this group and finds that the structure of the genitalia is very uniform
and of little help in the segregation of these species. A number of
specimens of ‘‘S. pallipes’’ from Irish localities were sent to him for
examination. In his opinion three distinct species are represented:
(1) 8. saltatoria Linn., including some specimens in which the three tibial
bars are indistinctly separated. There are also some examples of a salt-
marsh form which closely resembles S. opacula Zett., but is much larger. In these the front tibiae are marked with three bars instead of the
continuous line. Mr. China has decided to refer these tentatively to
S. saltatoria, and they are recorded as a variety of that species in the
present list. (2) S. pallipes Fabr., including the pale coloured variety
dimidiata Curt., searcely distinguishable from 8. pilosella Thoms., save by
much shorter pubescence. (3) A dark form of S. pallipes for which he
proposes to revive the name S. palustris Dougl. This species was
mentioned by Saunders as a variety of S. pallipes, but is omitted by
Butler from his Biology (1923). Reuter regarded it as a distinct species
and described two varieties, neither of which agrees with our specimens,
but there is a small dark form of thi§ species in which the markings are
frequently absent or obsolete which appears to occur in numbers in certain
British and Irish salt marsh localities. The extreme of this form is the
new species from Cork referred to by Renouf (1934). This content downloaded from. 194.254.138.123 on Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:59:01 UTC

Marsh by the River Slaney near Maemine: 29/7/’25 (H.). Found under flood-refuse in a marsh by the River Slaney. The
specimens are brachypterous, and in two of them the terminal segment of
the antenna is of a clear yellow colour with a black tip, a form which is
said to be the variety flori Dohrn., in a third specimen the terminal
segment is black. An entry in Haliday’s s. list “‘Salda elegantula Fall. Glasnevin, 49/7/’12’’ is no doubt intended to refer to Salda cincta HS.,
for which the name has been used, all the more likely as this common
species is not otherwise mentioned. Family XI.—CIMICIDAE. Ceratocombus coleoptratus Zett. NK. Killarney: shore of Lough Leane near Ross Castle, 28/8/’25. Kenmare Demesne: 4/9/'25 (H.). Muckross Demesne: 1/10/’26! (Bullock). Unrecorded as an Irish species, and known only from the Killarney
district where specimens were found under flood refuse on the shore of
Lough Leane, also among moss and leaf refuse in a marshy place in the
Kenmare Demesne. The insect is small and inconspicuous so that it may
have been overlooked in other places. The Killarney specimens are all
brachypterous; apparently the macropterous form is very rare. The
British localities range from Cornwall to Forres, and it is widely distributed
on the Continent. Pachycoleus rufescens J. Sahlb. NK. Muckross: in moist sphagnum, 31/3/’29, 13/3/’32, and 7/732. Dinis Island: in sphagnum, 10/4/31. Ardagh: brachypterous and

Killarney district a few years ago. The discovery of the winged form is

of interest, as it does not seem to have been noticed in Britain. ‘‘So far
as at present known it is always brachypterous” (Butler 723). In view
of this rarity some notes on the winged form are given here. Compared
with the brachypterous insect, in which the hind wings are rudimentary,
the following differences are noticeable :—

Macropterous Form. Male, size smaller. Pronotum widened towards
the hinder margin; scutellum larger and broader at the base, and the
metanotum is also much increased in size with a pointed apex; these
characters are connected with the greater wing development. Abdomen
more slender with narrower reflexed margins; style dagger shaped. Front
wings much longer and widely rounded at their extremities; the outer
posterior area is large and free of nervures. The hind wings are fully
developed, with three strong nervures, one lies close to the front margin,
the second is near the middle of the wing and runs to the outer margin,
and the third curves towards a point where there is a narrow and deep
fissure in the posterior margin of the wing. Pachycoleus is smaller than the preceding species, it is of similar
obscure habits and may be easily overlooked. In England this species has
been found in Devon, Hants, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire, frequenting moss
by streamlets in woodland places. The Continental range is mainly
northern and alpine, é.e., Finland, Scandinavia, Germany, and Italy. Cryptostemma alienum H.S. NK. Gap of Dunloe: banks of a rivulet, near the Black lakes, Haliday

28/4/'94, H.’08, ’95d. AN. ‘Banks of Mayne (Maine) River,’’ Haliday
MS.

Found amongst wet sand and gravel on the margins of mountain
streams, and probably only needs searching for in most highland districts. A. H. Haliday was the first to detect this insect in Britain, and his remarks
are of interest: ‘‘Inhabits the banks of rivers throughout the summer,
gliding amongst the wet gravel, its silky down protecting it from the wet. It takes flight readily, even off the surface of the water. The yellowish
larvae and pupae are found in the same situation, leaping like the perfect
insect’’ (Haliday ’55@). During April I have found in the River Dodder
both the adult and the larvae, evidently in the last instar. The latter are
yellowish, of a lighter tone than in the adult, with a red central blotch
on the abdominal segments. The British range is widespread though
confined to hilly districts; it is recorded from Central Europe, Italy, and

and this name is used in Oshanin’s ‘‘Katalog”’ (1912). Cimex lectularius Linn. Beyond the fact that it is recorded from Dublin, Belfast, and Armagh,
and I have notes of its occurrence in Waterford, Limerick, and Athlone,
nothing is known of the distribution of the ‘‘bed bug’’ in Ireland. Cimex pipistrelli Jen. AN. Toome, Lough Neagh : 4/6/’00 (Orr), H.’02. A few specimens found on bats captured near Toome by Mr. H. L.
Orr seems to be the only record of this bat parasite in Ireland. Oeciacus hirundinis Jen. ARB. On a dead swallow, Armagh (Johnson), Saunders ’92, and Johnson
*93. This species has been found in nests of the swallow, house-martin, and
sand-martin. Mr. Butler records it from at least seven counties in the
south of England and remarks: ‘‘As the bird host is so common and
generally distributed, it may be suspected that the above indicated tract
of country represents rather the distribution of observant Hemipterists
than the actual area inhabited by the Cimezx, unless, indeed, it should be:
the case that only weaklings amongst the birds are attacked by the parasite. Certainly, as far as present experience goes, this insect must be considered
« rare species with us, though where found it is usually abundant.”

WX. Sandhills at Kilmore Quay: 5/7/’32! (Stelfox). Mr. A. W. Stelfox found a male of this little hemipteron crawling up a
grass stem on the Ballyteige dunes about three miles west of Kilmore Quay. The insect is interesting, as it is the only one of the few endemic British
Hemiptera found in Ireland. Mr. W. E. China in recording the
distribution of the Myrmedobias remarks on this species: ‘‘The coastal
distribution of M. inconspicua is very similar to Aepophilus bonnairet
and Notonecta halophila Edw., mentioned in the section on the Lusitanian
element, and this species is probably a representative of the ancient
xerothermic Lusitanian fauna which has survived only in England and
has spread along the south coast of England to the east coast’? (China ’30). The known distribution is Suffolk, Sussex, Hampshire, Dorset, and Devon;
there are no Continental records. Mr. China. has verified the identification

size and colouring, and the three forms named by Reuter virescens,
pallescens, and grisescens all occur. The first of these is the ordinary green
form which, as in all species of Stenodema, has hibernated through the
winter months. The dark variety grisescens is common in marshy places,

general than the two preceding species. In the late summer and autumn
months a light coloured, almost roseate, form is found usually in dry
upland districts where the brake fern (Pteris aquilina) is abundant, as at
Killarney (8/’25), Connemara (8/734), and on the Dublin and Wicklow
hills (8/’33). Common in Great Britain from Cornwall to the Orkneys,
yet Mr. Butler points out an apparent absence of the insect from a large
tract of country between the Humber and the south coast of Kent, possibly
this may be accounted for by the absence of upland conditions,

first antennal segment shorter, but the entire antennae and also the legs
are shorter than in T. sawndersi D. & S., with which this species is liable
to be confused. 1. viridis is of northern range, occurring freely in Scotland

Ireland, but it was not till July, 1928, that the first Irish specimens were
collected near Clonmel. It was therefore a surprise to find it common in
Juncus-grown fields in the Sligo and Dromahair districts (July, ’32). It
seems to me that this may be a case of recent spreading of the species
in Ireland, as it was not noticed during a visit to the Sligo district in the
summer of 1904, and the insect is a conspicuous one not easily overlooked. I have always found it on Juncus and never in company with the common
L. ferrugata Fall. The Irish specimens are richly coloured, including
some dark forms of the male. Mr. Butler points out that the specific
name of this species is frequently wrongly spelt as dolobrata. It is
“derived from the Latin dolabra, a military axe, though what the connexion
is may not be easy to see.’’ In the short-winged females the sides of

266 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. the elytra are strongly convex, a very noticeable character during life,
this may have suggested the use of the name. The Continental range is
very wide, extending from W. Europe to Siberia; the species has been
introduced into America where it is now widespread. Lophus flavomarginatus Don. Ireland (Haliday), Saunders ’92. The only evidence we have of the occurrence of this species is a much
injured specimen in the Haliday collection marked as having been found
in Ireland. L. flavomarginatus is a southern insect in England ranging
from Suffolk to Cornwall, with one or two outlying localities. Possibly
it may belong to the group of species found in the south-eastern counties
of Ireland, of which Ischnodemus sabuleti and Adelphocoris seticornis
are examples. Butler remarks, ‘‘I have usually found it by sweeping in
rather damp grassy places in forest land, especially where wild roses are
growing.’’ The Continental range is apparently restricted to the south:

of September, though the adult may often be found in the early part of
that month. Alder is the favoured plant, especially where there are old-

Hatpert—A List of the Irish Hemiptera. 269

It is remarkable that this handsome species should have been overlooked
for so many years. In August, 1933, it was common in the extensive
marshes at Youghal the most westerly locality in which it has been found;
iy specimens were captured by sweeping plants in marshy places in the
months of July and August. On one occasion it was common in a marshy
hollow near Youghal where the only plants were a dense growth of the
rush Juncus glaucus mixed with fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica). The
insect is an active one, especially in warm bright weather, and it is probably
a wanderer on various plants. Mr. Butler’s remarks on the distribution of A. seticornis are of interest :
“Though rare with us, this species is found over the whole of Europe up
to Lat. 63°, and also in Turkestan and Siberia up to China. In Britain
it has occurred in five counties only, York, Kent, Hants. (I.W. ), Dorset,
and Devon. Its infrequency with us is not easily explicable, since it is a
cecommon species on the Continent.’’

variation in the black colouring of the elytra, and the Irish specimens
are the variety insularis Reuter, which is widely distributed in Britain
and seems more plentiful in northern localities. The Continental form
is larger and more richly coloured; it is of wide range in Northern and
Central Europe and Italy; with the exception of the latter country it
appears to be absent from the Mediterranean Region. Calocoris ochromelas Gmel. SK. Kenmare: larva on oaks, 7/98, H.’98. NK. Killarney (Bullock). WC. Rosscarbery: Cuthbert ’95. WA. Lismore: 7/’94 (H.). NG. Clon-

introduced through nursery stock, which has almost certainly happened
in the case of Pachytomella parallela Mey., recently found on larch trees
in the same locality. The Tibradden specimens were on conifers on the
Dublin hills and are more likely to be native. On the Continent it has

orchards. With regard to its occurrence in orchards Mr. Butler’s remarks
are of interest: ‘‘A curious modification is taking place in some parts of
Britain in the habits of this insect. The apple orchards in some parts of
the country are being seriously injured by immense numbers of it, which
pierce the young leaves and flower-buds, and so cause malformation or
complete withering of the parts attacked; much fruit is thus irretrievably
damaged or prevented altogether from developing; the specimens found
in orchards on apple mature much earlier than those in the open on
sallow.’”

localities in the counties of Dublin and Wicklow. I first met with it in
a small plantation of silver fir and larch in the Lucan Demesne, and I was
then under the impression that the species had occurred on the larch trees. As there was doubt about this I again searched the locality in September,
1929, and was successful in finding it definitely on silver fir, on which tree
it has occurred in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. As in the case of
Lygus rubricatus the present. species may have been introduced through
nursery stock into the Lucan Demesne; it is more likely to be native in the
Powerscourt locality at the foot of the Wicklow hills. The recorded

were sent recently to Mr. W. E. China who identifies them as P. palustris
Reuter, a species of very local occurrence in the south-west of England. T have examined a long series of supposed P. unifasciatus irom various
Trish localities and they are all P. palustris, so it would seem that the
former species does not occur in Ireland. The Irish specimens are of dark
colouring with the yellow thoracic margin reduced to a thin line (not
absent as stated by Butler of English specimens). There are structural
differences in the antennae, the second segment being shorter and thicker
in P. unifasciatus. P. palustris is always found in marshy places by sweeping among
rushes and other plants, and not on Galium on which plant it is commonly
found abroad. Widely distributed on the Continent, ranging from South

irom May to October. The Irish specimens are so uniformly brachypterous
that, it was surprising to find the macropterous female in a meadow at
Glenageary in July, 1933. Mr. Butler reports it as of very rare occurrence
in Britain: ‘‘A specimen is recorded by Douglas and Scott as taken by
Dr. Power at Shirley, Surrey, in August, 1862; I have one taken by
E. Saunders at Cobham, Surrey, in July, 1880, and one, without locality,
ex coll, Capron.’’ The exceptionally dry summer of 1933 may have had
something to do with the development of the winged form. This content downloaded from. 194.254.138.123 on Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:59:01 UTC

which was unknown to me. On further search a second specimen was
swept from plants near the same group of trees. Mr. W. E. China has
identified these specimens as the present species—a recent addition to the
British List. Mr. Butler records® it from two localities—Theydon Bois on
the borders of Epping Forest, Essex, and Wimborne, Dorset. In both
cf these places, as well as at Santry, only the male was found. Mr. K. G.
Blair has since taken the brachypterous female in Perthshire and not on
pines, his specimens were on grass: ‘‘on a sandy meadow beside the River
Lockay with no spruce only scattered alders, in the vieinity’’ (Blair, 1932). It is probable that the Santry specimens may have been introduced through
their food-plants. P. parallela oceurs in middle and southern Europe,
and Reuter gives its habitat as in mountainous or alpine regions, but does
not mention conifers,

286 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Cyrtorrhinus pygmaeus Zett. WX. Near Wexford: 4/8/’25 (H.). DU. Head of Malahide estuary:
2/9/°28 (HL). The Wexford specimen was taken in a marshy place by the River
Slaney; both localities are estuarine. Widespread in England, from
Devon to Northumberland, and in Northern and Central Europe. Cyrtorrhinus flaveolus Reut. DU. Portmarnock: salt marsh, 23/9/’27. Head of Malahide estuary :
2/9/'28 (HL). An unrecorded Irish species which I have found only in these estuarine
localities on the north Dublin coast. The macropterous female occurred
at Malahide; it is much rarer than the brachypterous form. This distinet
little species is of south-eastern range in Great Britain (Norfolk to Dorset). On the Continent it has also a restricted distribution, as it seems to have
been found only in Finland and Sweden. The genus Orthotylus which follows is a comparatively large one, of
which we possess fourteen of the eighteen recorded Bri species. Many
of these are very closely allied and some are apparently of very local
oceurrence on their food-plants. With the exception of a few common
species such as 0. marginalis, O. ochrotrichus, and O. ericetorum the
Trish forms are little known, no less than six are represented by single
records; in all probability most of them will eventually prove of wide
distribution in this country. Orthotylus bilineatus Fall. SK. Derrynane: on aspens, 22/7/’34! (Stelfox). DO. Slieve Donard
Demesne: on aspens, 8/'02 (H.). Abundant on aspens in the first-mentioned locality and also at Glenear
in County Kerry. A search in suitable places where the food-plant is
native will probably reveal its presence elsewhere, as the insect is wide-
spread in Great Britain and on the Continent. Orthotylus flavinervis Kb. WC. Glengarriff: 13/7/’24 (H.). WA. Fermoy: 7/'94, 1I.’95 a. Very local though probably overlooked; in both of these localities it
was found on alders (Alnus glutinosa), the usual food-plant. While the
Continental range is Northern and Central Europe, in England it has been
recorded mainly from the southern counties, though Mr. Butler states

as far north as the county Dublin. It is rare, however, in this county
where I found larvae in the last instar and adults on brambles (Rubus)
in an old orchard near Glenageary at the end of July. Mr. Butler found
the adult ‘‘maturing about the last week of June” so that the full
development of the insect may occur later in Ireland. The species is found
as far north as Yorkshire in Great Britain, and the Continental range
extends over the whole of Europe. Heterocordylus tibialis Hahn. SK. Kenmare: 7/’98 (H.). NK. Dingle: 5/’94. Muckross Demesne:

the genus Psallus, and we know little of their distribution in Ireland, or
of the plants on which they are found. In some cases the species are closely
allied, and the characters used in distinguishing them are often of an
unsatisfactory kind and need supplementing, notably in the ‘‘fallenit’”’
group. Referring to this Mr. W. E. China, who has verified some
identifications of P. almi and P. fallenii, remarks: ‘‘It is time someone
revised this genus on genital characters, although there is such a mass of
synonymy that it will be almost impossible to apply the correct names.”’

Hasert—A List of the Irish Hemiptera. 297

have been found washed up after high floods, especially on the eastern
shores. Elsewhere in Ireland it occurs in three of our largest southern
rivers, the Suir, the Nore, and the Barrow. In the Dublin district I have
found it in one of the drains connected with the Grand Canal; these are
known locally as ‘‘back-drains’’ and they carry off overflow water between
the canal loughs. At times there is a considerable rush of water through
these drains when they resemble rapid streams, harbouring such plants as
Ranunculus penicillatus and Potamogeton densus, as well as a few species
of fresh-water mollusca, isopods, and insects. I do not know of any other
Dublin locality, so that the insect may have found its way from the River
Barrow which flows under the canal at Monasterevan. The winged form of montandoni Horv. has not been found in Britain. It is a rapid swimmer and appears to favour running water, frequenting
mill ponds, streams, and rivers in localities ranging from Somerset to
Yorkshire, Central Europe, and Northern Russia. Family XV.—_NOTONECTIDAE. The three insects known as Notonecta furcata Fabr., N. maculata Fabr.,
and N. marmorea viridis Dele., were for long recorded as varieties of the
common N. glauca Linn. There are reasons, however, for treating these
as distinet species, one being the fact that no intermediate forms occur,
at least in Western Europe. On this point Mr. J. Edwards writes:
“It does not appear that there is any reason for assuming that the laws
of heredity are suspended in the case of Notonecta; and there is no
advantage in continuing to attribute to N. glauca a degree of variability
that it does not possess,’’

The absence of N. maculata from Ireland, which has yet to be proved,
would be additional evidence in favour of treating it as a distinct species. Notonecta glauca Linn. SK. Kenmare: 7/’98, H.’98- NK. Killarney distriet: common (H.

(H’12). Locally common and seems to occur most frequently in pools in bog
lands, sometimes to the exclusion of the common N. glauca Linn. (Notonecta maculata Fabr. The dark form of N. glauca in which the elytra are more or less
mottled with black has evidently been mistaken for this species in Ireland. The records Clonmacate and Lough Oughter, Johnson ’93 and ’94, should
refer to N. glauca. I have not been able to trace the Waterville specimens
collected by Yerbury and recorded by Distant ’02; there may have been
an error also in this case. It is likely, however, that the species will
eventually be found here, as it is widely distributed in England. Apart
from the black marking on the hemielytra N. maculata Fabr. may be
recognised by the orange-yellow metanotum, in N. glauca and its varieties
this is always black, (See Edwards, Entom. Mo, Mag., 1918, p. 58.)] Notonecta marmorea viridis Dele. WX. Pool at Ballyteige Burrows near Kilmore Quay: 26/8/’31 (H.). The only locality known to me for this unrecorded Irish species is a
Chara-pool beside the Ballyteige dunes on the south coast of Wexford. The water was slightly brackish, and with the exception of some water
beetles such as Coelambus inaequalis, Hydroporus palustris, and the local
Agabus conspersus, there was little to be found in the pool. The late
J. Edwards described this species as new (N. halophila Edw.) in his
paper® on the genus Notonecta from specimens collected in the south of
England. Some of these were examined by M. Raymond Poisson,” who

states they are identical with N. viridis Delcourt, which is known to occur
in brackish water in north-western France and in Holland. It is now
regarded as a form of N. marmorea Fabr., a non-British species ‘widely
distributed in fresh-water throughout the Mediterranean region, and
extends through Palestine and Crimea to Persia and Transcaspia.”’

N. marmorea viridis has been found in a few south of England
localities ranging from Norfolk to Cornwall, and there seems little doubt,
as has been pointed out by Mr. W. E. China (1930), that it is a species
of Lusitanian origin. Plea minutissima Fabr. NE. Streamlet near Gallerus Sands: Haliday and Hogan, 1855 b.

two of the latter are probably only aberrant forms. It is likely that the

such as C, limitata Fieb. and C. venusta D. & S., a wide range is indicated. The following would seem to be really local :—C. dentipes Thoms., C. scotti

¢, 15/8/03 (HL). Recorded as a British species by Mr. W. E. China from a Lincolnshire
specimen found by Mr. J. E. Mason as long ago as 1887.7" The species
closely resembles C. geoffroyi Leach, from which it is easily recognised by
the structure of the second pair of legs. In the same year (1928)
Mr. E. Bullock found it in a small lake ‘‘full of black peaty mud’’ on
boggy ground where he has since taken it in numbers during the months
of May, September, and October. The Lough Beg specimen is a female,
showing the sinuate base of the tibia and the markings of the upper surface
are less indistinct than is usual in dentipes. Though local this species is being brought to light in various localities,
and it is now definitely recorded from Essex, Cambridge, Norfolk, Lincoln,
Stafford, and as far north as Cumberland. The Continental range is
extensive including Scandinavia, Central Europe, Russia, and Siberia. Corixa panzeri Fieb. NK. Killarney district: May, June, and September (Bullock). WX. Wexford district: 8/’25. Ballyteige: 8/’31 (H.). EG. Galway district :

but this form must be very rare. The species has been recorded from
N. Britain and ranges into the south-western parts of England. Apparently
it is little known on the Continent; Butler mentions France only. Corixa nigrolineata Fieb. NE. Dingle; 6/’94 (H.). Lough Eaghter, 1,550 ft., Scharff and

the legs are pale coloured, not ‘‘more or less black,’’ as described by
Butler. The species has also been recorded from England (Hants, Cambs,
and Westmorland), where it is represented by a smaller and narrower
form with distinct markings on the upper surface. The dark form is ‘‘widely distributed in the mountains of Scotland,
while elsewhere it occurs in Sweden, Lapland, Arctic Russia, and the
mountains of Central Europe and Greece’’ (China, 1930). Corixa bonsdorffi Sahib. SK. Kenmare. NK. Killarney: Ballast Pit, Ardagh, and Guitane Bog,

308 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. given some attention to these insects and in their identification, which often
presents difficulties, he has had much valuable assistance from the late
J. Edwards, F.x.s., who was our leading authority on the group; most of
the species, especially in such genera as Liburnia and Athysanus, have been
verified by him. The great majority of the specimens are now in the
collection of the Irish National Museum. Much work remains to be done in this group more especially in
ascertaining the range of the species. The available records even of our
commonest forms are few in number, and some recently collected material
remains to be identified. Under these circumstances it has been considered
desirable to restrict this section of the report to a list of the species which
certainly occur in Ireland followed by localities for some of the rarer
and more interesting forms. The nomenclature used is that of the Edwards ‘‘Catalogue’’ which was
published in 1908,%* Many changes have been suggested in recent years
chiefly affecting the generic names and their systematie arrangement. There is an advantage, however, in following a catalogue the nomenclature
of which agrees largely with Mr. Edwards’ monograph on ‘‘The Hemiptera
Homoptera of the British Islands’ (Edwards ’96), a standard work in
which the species are described and figured; combined with his more
recent papers it is still the principal guide for students of the British
fauna. Among the species which are apparently missing from the Irish fauna
are a number characteristic of southern England, notably Cicadetta
montana Scop. (a New Forest insect), Gargara genistae Fabr., Tettigometra
impressopunctatus Sign., and Ledra aurita Linn. On the other hand there
are in Ireland several uncommon species some of which are of southern
origin, the following may be mentioned:—Jssus coleoptratus Geoffr. (Glengarriff), Oliarus leporinus Linn. (Killarney), Araeopus pulchellus
Curt. (south and west of Ireland), Delphax lugubrina Boh., and Stenocranus
longipennis Curt. (marshes in south-east Ireland). Such species as have been recorded are mainly to be found in the
reports of the Lambay and Clare Island Surveys (H.’06 and ’12). They
are marked with an asterisk in the following list :—

FAMILY CERCOPIDAE. Aphrophora alni Fall. A large dark-coloured form of this common
species, in which the second costal blotch is absent, occurs in marshy places,
as at NK. Killarney: 7/’27 (H.). EC. Youghal: 8/’33, and DU. Sutton:
8/’28 (H.). In the west of Ireland I haye found the typical form on
sweet-gale (Myrica) and willows, as well as on alder. It has also been
recorded as an injurious species ‘‘present in numbers on the tops of
potato shoots causing shrivelling and arrest of growth’’ (Carpenter 716). Aphrophora myricae Edw. WI. Arklow: common in marshy fields by

is also a variety which differs from the typical form in having the
hinder part of the pronotum black instead of green, and the spots on
the head are joined to form a more or less continuous dark band. This variety has been found on lake shores at WM. Castlebar: (H.’12),
