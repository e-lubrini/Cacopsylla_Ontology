Phytoplasmas are procaryotic organisms that were first observed in 1967. They
colonise sieve tubes, preventing the transport of matter, and also take the host growth
and storage substances, causing significant growth changes that lead to reduced quality
and quantity of yields. They are therefore economically important plant pathogens. To the
host cells they come by the help of sap-feeding insect. In the case of Candidatus
Phytoplasma prunorum and Ca. P. mali the insect is of the Cacopsylla genus. The aim of the work was to detect the european stone fruit phytoplasma
in Cacopsylla pruni individuals and the apple proliferation phytoplasma in C. picta
and C. melanoneura individuals. All individuals were collected in overwintering sites. Furthermore, the concentration of Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum was established
by quantitative PCR in C. pruni. This work extended knowledge of the molecular
epidemiology of phytoplasmas and vector bionomics. Total the 803 Cacopsylla spp. individuals (346 pieces of C. pruni, 141 pieces

3.1 Introduction to phytoplasmas

Phytoplasms are bacteria found in the Tenericutes division, Mollicutes
(Berges et al., 2000). They were first observed in the 1960s
electron microscope (Doi et al., 1967). These round and fibrous buikas are large
200 - 800 nm and do not have a cell wall (IRPCM, 2004). Their genome size 600 -
2200 kb (Marcone et al., 1999) is characteristically low in cytosine
and guanine bases (Gundersen ert al., 1994; Seemiiller et al., 1998). Their pipeline is
probably derived from gram-positive bacteria of the lactobacilli group (Bai et al., 2004). Phytoplasms survive amnesia only in the hypertonic environment, on hypotonic
the premises are sensitive. They can reproduce by pounding, paving by dividing
and fiber fragmentation (Seemiiller et al., 2004). In 1967, phytoplasmas were first detected in sitkovic aster (Doi ef al.,
1967). Today, it is already known that phytoplasmas cause diseases of many plants, including those
farms of difficulties, for which they reduce the quality and quantity of yield. This diivode
phytoplasmic pathogens are among the economically important pathogens. In the Czech Republic
quarantine phytoplasmas Candidatus Phytoplasma mali, Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum,
Approx. Phytoplasma pyri, Stolbur Phytoplasma. Phytoplasms continue to occur in the European Union
as Grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma, Peach rosette phytoplasma, Western X
disease phytoplasma and dal8Si, which are also phased among the quarantine. Phytoplasms colonize plant strains and can also occur in native plants
parenchymal host cells (IRPCM, 2004). Into the host organism
arriving with the help of his vector, especially the descendant Nadéeledi Psylloidea. This insect is
It feeds on plant conditions, with which it can also suck phytoplasm, but in its body
pomnoZi. When another plant is impaled, the phytoplasm is transferred to the new host. It is therefore a persistent mode of transmission. Insects vector in the presence of the present
phytoplasm is not affected, but in some cases phytoplasm can cause its
premature death (McCoy et al., 1989). Symptoms of phytoplasmic infestation are due to their occurrence in plant seedlings. They disrupt the functions of this plant tissue and, as a result, root changes. These changes are due to the removal of multiples and scabies by the phytoplasm, because
one of nutrient-bearing organisms (Seemiiller et al., 2004). Except for plant removal
important substances also block the transport of substances in the plant, which again detracts from the morphology
plants. Typical symptoms of phytoplasmic infection include, for example, a reduction in leaf size,
Jaundice, chlorotic coil and pediatric leaf decay, sterility of flowers, present
deciduous or dried fruit, gradually dying out and from the whole tree (IRPCM,
2004). In some cases, however, the infection may be asymptomatic, so-called. latent

(McCoy et al., 1989). 3.2 Taxonomic phytoplasma sealing

According to IRPCM (2004), phytoplasms, based on 16SrDNA analysis sequencing, are
divided into fifteen groups. These are the Aster yellows group (16SrI), Peanut
witches * -broom group (16SrII), X-disease group (16SrIII), Coconut lethal yellowing group
(16SrIV), Elm yellows group (16SrV), Clover proliferation group (16SrVI), Ash yellows
group (16SrVII), Loofah witches’-broom group (16SrVIII), Pigeon pea witches’-broom
group (16SrIX), Apple proliferation group (16SrX), Rice yellow dwarf group (16SrXI),
Stolbur group (16SrXII), Mexican periwinkle virescence group (16SrXIII), Bermuda grass
white leaf group (16SrXIV) a ‘Ca. Phytoplasma brasiliense ’group (16SrXV) (IRPCM,
2004). According to the IRPCM, the 16SrX group is represented by the Six Candidate Species

The most important representative of group 16 SrX is Candidatus Phytoplasma mali,
which causes severe apple disease as apple proliferation (Seemiiller et al.,
1994). This pathogen can also attack stone fruits (Lee et al., 1995). Group
However, apple proliferation also involves other phytoplasmas responsible for fruit diseases
stromt in Europe. They are mainly Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum, causing European
Zucchini, and Ca. Phytoplasma pyri, which is otherwise terrible (Seemiiller
et al., 1994). This diploma thesis deals only with the phytoplasm of the European Stone Yolk
and the phytoplasm of apple proliferation, therefore only the characteristics of these will be given below

two microorganisms. 3.3 Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum

Phytoplasm, causing a disease known as the European Stonegrass
has been detected in many European countries, such as France, Italy, Germany,
Romania, Greece, Spain, Switzerland and, last but not least, the Czech Republic (EPPO,
1996b). Its presence has also been found in Turkey (Jarausch et al., 2000)

Its main hosts are fruit trees of the genus Prunus, especially merufika
(Prunus armeniaca), peach (Prunus persica), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), plum (Prunus
insititia), Prunus domestica and Japanese plum (Prunus salicina). Further
attacks Prunus dulcis and Prunus serrulata (Seemiiller
et al., 1998). Based on PCR-RFLP analysis, this pathogen has been identified in many others
of the other genus Prunus. Furthermore, it can naturally infect certain weeds, such as the weed

(Convolvulus arvensis) or ringworm (Cynodon dactylon) (Nemeth, 1986). 3.3.1 Symptoms of European Stone Yew

The best time to detect symptoms of ESFY is before flowering trees
late summer, but the symptoms of Ize disease observed throughout the year. The most prominent symptom is the marked stunting of the infected trees. Leaves infected
stromt are often coiled with a mild and strong Zloutenka. Initially, they are modified only

leaves on individual branches, but gradually this symptom spreads throughout the crown. 11

Furthermore, the leaves may have reduced Gepeles or premature leaves. For example, in the species Prunus
salicina reduces the size of the leaves and turns them red. Infested trees
have equal Reduced number of flowers used. The fruits are smaller, premature
they ripen and fall off or may dry out on the branches (EPPO, 1996b). Infected trees
apricots die 12 - 24 months after the first symptoms. This wonder is
European Yolk stone fruit is a major disease of the fruit trees, which is marked
affects the economic income from their cultivation. In France, the phytoplasm is European

Seedlings of stone fruits are responsible for thyn 60-70% of apricot trees (EPPO, 1996b). 3.3.2 Distribution in the plant

The distribution of the phytoplasm depends on its host, interactions with the host
and last but not least, the phytoplasm itself. Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum in the process
all year round the coffins of the infested tree. It can still occur in his
peaks, even during the winter (Seemiiller et al., 1998), which was confirmed by their experiments
and Jarausch et al. (1999). This distinguishes ESFY from the proliferation of apple trees, which winters

remains in the coffins. 3.3.3 Transmission methods

The phytoplasm of European stone fruit can be transferred from one tree to
types of forging and grafting. This method of transfer is possible throughout the year,
because ESFY pastries in the top parts of the tree also in winter (Seemiiller et al., 1998;
Jarausch et al., 1999). Seed transmission has not yet been proven. Neéas et al. (2008)
using PCR, demonstrated the presence of ESFY in seeds from infested trees,
however, these seeds showed 4.5x lower viability and 7x lower clearance than the seeds

coming from a healthy tree. A more important method of transfer is vector aid. V piipadé Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum is a measure of Cacopsylla pruni that this pathogen pie

persistent. 12

3.4 Candidatus Phytoplasma mali

The phytoplasm of apple proliferation is spread almost all over Europe, also in Syria
of Turkey. Its main host is jabloi domacf (Malus domestica), pti ¢ emz
individual varieties show no greater sensitivity. Among the most sensitive varieties is
for example Florina and Prima (Loi et al., 1995) and among the tolerant examples Spartan and Wealthy
(Nemeth, 1986). Other hosts include Dahlia cultorum (Kaminska et Sliwa, 2008),
Prunus avium, Prunus armeniaca and Prunus domestica (Mehle et al., 2006). This

the phytoplasm can be artificially transferred to various species of the genus Malus (Németh, 1986). 3.4.1 Symptoms of apple proliferation

Symptoms of apple proliferative disease are highly variable and often present
only in some st dech crowns. Typical symptoms include the formation of methylate branches,
piicemz boéni shoots metel svriraj sharp shares with termindl. Next to the infected stroma. there are enlarged stipules having the character of a small leaf. Small round ones are also typical
leaves with irregular serrations. It is important to have late and repeated flowering
also signs a reduction in the quality and quantity of the fruit. Infested trees can also die

(EPPO, 1996a). 3.4.2 Distribution in the plant

It was found from the distribution of Ca. Phytoplasma were not present in the infested trees
constant during the year (Schaper et Seemiiller, 1982). Seemiiller et al. (1984) stated, Ze
in the winter months, the concentration of phytoplasm in the infected strain decreases
tree as a result of the degradation of sows. Baric et al. (2011) found that it is the largest at this time
phytoplasmic concentration in cacophenes. Phytoplasmic resettlement of the strain occurs
in April and May and the maximum concentration in the phytoplasmic strain is reached at the end of summer. During the spring, the phytoplasm does not occur in the peak parts of plants, maximum values
in these places in Gervence and December (Pedrazzoli et al., 2008),
In fact, it is not possible to explain the temperature sensitivity of the pathogen, because without problems the bread even with
temperatures of + 4 to 2 - 20 ° C (Seemiiller et al., 1984). The distribution of phytoplasm in the trees is
affected by higher temperatures. In France, it was found that infected trees report

symptoms at 21 to 25 ° C, but at 29 to 32 ° C are

13

symptoms suppressed and phytoplasm colonizes only caffeines. Lowering the temperature leads

to repopulate the strain by the pathogen (Ducroquet et al., 1986). 3.4.3 Transmission methods

There are two ways to transfer apple proliferation. The first way is to transfer aid
roubti or oéek, i.e. vegetative (Seidl et Komarkova, 1974). Kind of and more important
the method is the transfer of vectors, which are mainly Cacopsylla melanoneura
and Cacopsylla picta (Seemiiller, 1990). Apple proliferation vectors are characterized by persistent pitenosis of this
pathogen. Wintering adults migrate from their winters to their orchards, where
During June and July, I produce a new generation (Mattedi et al., 2008). Approx. Phytoplasma mali is pirendéSena only adults, larval transmission has not been confirmed

(Tedeschi et Alma, 2004). 3.5 Phytoplasm - vector relationship

Raéd Hemiptera includes three subidids, namely Heteroptera (roaches), Sternorrhyncha
(mSicosavi) and Auchenorrhyncha (kiisi). The Sternorrhynch podidd falls, among other things,
Psylloidea (measures) comprising about three thousand worldwide species
about four hundred species occurring in Europe (Burckhardt, 1994). Psylloidea
include Sest Celedi véetné Celedi Psyllidae (meroviti), which includes the genus Cacopsylla,
including all important phytoplasma vectors invading fruit trees,
and Cacopsylla melanoneura, C. picta and C. pruni. For the determination of the most important members of the genus Cacopsylla spp. was aggravated
web interface www.psyllidkey.info (Burckhardt et al., 2008), which is currently
available in English and German. The vector of the phytoplasma is a stinging sava insect that brings the phytoplasm together

the incubation period has elapsed (Carraro et al., 2011). Length of incubian, or latent, periods
ranges most often from two to four weeks (but can last up to 80 days) and depends on

temperature (Murral et al., 1996). Phytoplasm multiplies during the latent period

14

and its circulation in the body of the vector. This pathogen arrives at the plant during suction
epithelium of the sinus cavity, where they multiply. He then arrives in the body cavity and hemolymph, where
is multiplying. In order for the pathogen to be pathogenic, the phytoplasm must reach
salivary Zl4z insects, from where they get to a new host during the Sav sleigh (Tsai, 1979),
At the same time, its quantities must reach sufficiently high concentrations. The effect of phytoplasm on the vector is highly variable and is determined by the type of vector
factors prostiedi, namely pitedevSim temperature. The phytoplasm may be on its vector
negative or positive effect, such as in the phytoplasm of Aster
the vector Macrosteles quadrilineatus. Right in the females of this vector, there is an increase

fertility and life extension (Beanland et al., 2000). 3.6 Biology of food Psyllidae

VétSina mer, both larvae and adults, are alive with 8 weeks of plant phloem,
they have certain food preferences. Most often, the measures are monophagous, which means I prefer
only one plant species, they can also be oligophagous or polyphagous (Ossiannilsson,
1992). Adults are usually able to temporarily attack other, if not preferred,
plants. The vast majority of other species of the species are characterized by sexual reproduction, they are
the development of parthenogenesis (Hodkinson, 1974). Mery put an elongated egg in
plant tissues and, depending on the species, on new buds, in the bush or on the leaves where
I cause deformation of the blade. The larvae go through five developmental stages during which they are
dorsoventral prostheses. The southern and tropical species of the Psyllidae are polyvoltinni, coz
means that they have several offspring during the year. The types of mild pds are the other way around
bivoltinni ¢ i univoltinni. I species these species like eggs, larvae or adults on their own

winters and returns to their hosts at coffee (Burckhardt, 1994). Important ulivoltinni species, such as Cacopsylla melanoneura, C. picta and C. pruni,
I eat as adults and are obliged to keep my plant hosts for the winter
and reproduction (Cermak et Lauterer, 2007). In these species, piezimation was observed in

high altitudes on needles, with migration to wintering grounds and back is

15

during long distances, such as C. pruni, when the apartment disappears
migration length aZ 27 km (Thebaud et al., 2009). Current studies show that chemical matter is excreted by host plants
influenced by migratory behavior. For example, C. melanoneura migration between hosts
plants corresponds to a change in plant preference during the life cycle of this measure
(Mayer and Gross, 2007). Gross et Mekonen (2005) found that odors excreted by plants
C. picta (monophagous species) and C. melanoneura (oligophagous species) also affect behavior. It was
It is found that phytoplasma-infested apple trees are more attractive to C. picta than
trees are healthy, for which the right specific substances excreted by the infected are responsible

trees (Mayer et al., 2008). 3.7 Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum vectors

It has been identified as the only phytoplasm vector in Europe
Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli). C. pruni is a species occurring in almost all of Europe (Lauterer,
1999) and Central Asia. This measure is an oligophagous species of Zijici on plants of the genus Prunus spp. During
year produces a single generation and its adults overwinter on conifers. At the end
In winter, adults migrate back to the orchards of Prunus spp., where they reproduce. New
generation in the orchards until the beginning of July, when it flies back to the winter (Carraro et

al., 2001). 3.8 Candidatus Phytoplasma mali vectors

At present, there are two two phytoplasma vectors of apple proliferation, namely
Cacopsylla picta and C. melanoneura (Foerster, 1848). C. picta is only distributed in Europe as a monophagous species living on apple trees
(Malus spp.). During the year, it produces only one generation, which adults overwinter at

conifers. In the spring, C. picta returns from the winter season to the apple trees, where he lays eggs. 16

Individuals of the new generation live on apple trees and from the beginning of July, when they are more abandoned as
adults (Tedeschi et al., 2009). (Rosaceae), hawthorn (Crataegus spp. ), apple trees (Malus spp.) and the game (Pyrus
spp.). The life cycle is the same as in C. picta with the difference that adults are more likely to plant
diive and the same so the new generation of diive flies off in winter (Mattedi et al., 2008). C. picta and C. melanoneura occurred in most of the studied countries
common or only C. melanoneura occurred here (Jarausch et al., 2003; Mattedi et al.
al., 2008; Tedeschi et al., 2002). A comparison of the significance of these two vectors was devoted to
several studios, which, however, arrived at completely different results. In Germany and the north
Italy was as a more efficient vector Ca. Phytoplasma mali marked C. picta (Jarausch et al.,
2003; Carraro et al., 2008), on the other hand, was identified as the main vector in the Aosta Valley in Italy
C. melanoneura (Tedeschi et al., 2002). In addition, it has been found in Germany (Mayer et al.,
2009) from C. melanoneura phytoplasm proliferation of apple trees is not able to transmit. The phytoplasm of apple proliferation is the only phytoplasm in which it has been recorded
more help in the area. It has been found that this phytoplasm disappears flat, at least
under experimental conditions, brought with the help of Fisaberiella flori (Tedeschi et al.

Alma, 2006). However, the significance of the transfer of aid to F. Floria is questionable. 3.9 Use of real-time PCR in a phytoplasma study

Real-time PCR can also be used for phytoplasma studies for detection and molecular studies
epidemiological studies. There is one method in which continuous amplification occurs
detection of the amplicon during each cycle. Phytoplasma detection is usually
performed by PCR conversion with primers designed for 16S rRNA. They made their low
however, nested PCR is often required for the concentration in the samples. Lately, for their

The real-time PCR method, which has a comparable sensitivity to nested PCR, also uses detection

  

and compared to the convention of PCR, it has a number of advantages: it is more accurate, faster, has a greater dynamic range

and has a lower risk of contamination. In addition to detection, real-time PCR can be used
study of phytoplasma epidemiology, for example in determining the infectivity of insect vectors

and evaluation of plant phytoplasmic resistance. 17

The development of phytoplasma detection techniques using real-time PCR has in recent years
fada occupied working groups. To speed up the detection of Candidatus Phytoplasma mali
Baric et Dalla-Via (2004) proposed a procedure using multiplex real-time PCR, during which
simultaneous amplification of the 16S rRNA gene of the achloroplast gene pathogen occurs
apple trees. To speed up the diagnosis and simplify the study of Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum was proposed by Yvon et al. (2009) Detection procedure to be applied to members of the genus
plums and Cacopsylla pruni vector. Hodgetts et al. (2009) dealt with routine diagnostics
phytoplasma and developed a procedure for universal and group specific detection which
uses primers and probes designed for 23S rRNA. Universal phytoplasma detection has developed
in Oberhansli et al. (2011). Their procedure is based on simultaneous detection of phytoplasm and 18S
rRNA host gene using TaqMan probes. Concurrent with the use of real-time PCR for phytoplasma detection, this method was initiated
can also be used for their quantification, both in plant and insect vectors. Christensen et al. (2004) studied the number of phytoplasmas in plants and their localization in situ (using
bioimaging methods). Torres et al. (2005) proposed a procedure for sensitive and simultaneous detection
aquantification with 16SrX group phytoplasmas in plants and further compared the sensitivity of detection
using conventional PCR, nested PCR and real-time PCR. The result was found to be sensitive
nested and real-time PCR are comparable. Torres et al. (2010) applied the quantification procedure
ESFY cultivars Svestky. Martini et al. (2011) studied the dependence of external
piiznakii infection of host stroma of the genus Prunus at the concentration of the European phytoplasm
Seedlings of the stones and found that a certain degree of correlation exists. Jarausch et al. (2004) developed a procedure for the quantification of Candidatus Phytoplasma
small in Cacopsylla picta. The same procedure can be used for quantification in apple trees. Jarausch
et al. (2007a) studied the phytoplasm concentration of apple proliferation in individual species

France and northern Switzerland. Due to the fact that in these regions AP piendSena only

In 2006 and 2011, there was no significant difference in the number of captured
males and females. During the winter months, due to the low temperature, the capture was rather accidental. Capture of the culmination culminated in the month of inor and March, when it was due to rising temperatures
increased its activity and there was a passive migration to the orchards. In the period between April
In July, only a small number of individuals were captured because they spend this period
individuals scattered in orchards. The second culmination of the capture at the turn of August and September

confirms the migration of C. pruni from the orchard back to winter. 5.1.2 Detection of Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum in Cacopsylla pruni individuals

The unit Cacopsylla picta was captured significantly less (141 pieces) than the unit
C. pruni (346 kusi) and C. melanoneura (316 kust). It was obtained in individual catches
only a few custards of this kind, therefore it is not possible to deduce unambiguous results from the obtained results
closures. In 2006 and 2011, there was no significant difference in the number of captured
samct and female. The biggest capture of C. picta was in the winter months and at the end of the summer, when it measures

migrates from orchards to winters. 5.1.4 Detection of Candidatus Phytoplasma in Cacopsylla picta individuals

Detection of Candidatus Phytoplasma mali was performed in 141 individuals of C. picta. The expected product is about 1,200 bp, which corresponded to a specific amplicon

For the quantification of the phytoplasm of the European stonegrass in the vector Cacopsylla
A standard, the ECA1 / ECA2 PCR product, was prepared. For standard preparation
DNA from positive sample é was used. 3308. The cloning plasmid carried the product
ECAI / ECA2 was introduced into E. coli bacteria by thermal shock. Of all ten
PCR reaction colonies of the tested bacterial colonies were obtained by subsequent electrophoresis
product with a size of about 490 bp (see Fig. 4), which marked the correctness of the transformation. This also confirmed that the DNA sequence of the phytoplasm had been inserted into the plasmid

5.3 Quantitative determination of the phytoplasma Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum and C. pruni

Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum was quantified in 71 individuals (of which 47
males and 24 females) Cacopsylla pruni, which were assisted by nested PCR in previous
phytoplasm detected in the experiments. Absolute quantification was performed according to
calibrated curves using Rotor-Gene 6 (Corbett Research). Quantification of ESFY in individual vector pieces was performed in duplicate
replicates from which the primers of phytoplasmic copipytes in a given individual were calculated. The range of ESFY concentrations in C. pruni males was and from 6 538 156 copies to
one individual. In females, the number of kopifs in the range 1 to 4,092,739 was found. Primary number
the ESFY copif acquired 593,445 in males. In females, the primary number was niZ3i,
ato 434 377. Complete results of quantification of the phytoplasm of European stone fruit jaundice
are listed in Tab. 21. The results of the quantification of the European phytoplasm of the stonegrass in individuals
Cacopsylla spp. it follows that the phytoplasm in the vector occurs either at a relatively low level
number of kopifs (up to 1,000 kopifs per individual) or vice versa in a high number of kopifs (over 1,000
kopif on individuals). In 13 males and 6 females, ESFY content of over 1,000 copies was found
individuals. The occurrence of a smaller number of ESFY kopifs in C. pruni individuals was more frequent - specific

in 34 malts and 18 females. 42

6 Discussion

The aim of the work was to disseminate knowledge about the molecular epidemiology of phytoplasmas
Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum and Candidatus Phytoplasma mali and their bionomy
vectors. To achieve this goal, I developed a literary research on a given topic
analyzed vectors of Cacopsylla spp. caught in winter. V piipadé Cacopsylla
pruni I also performed a quantification of the phytoplasm of the European Stone Yolk. The results of this study will help to design measures to prevent or limit the networking of these
plant pathogens in intensive plantings and thus reduce the economic losses that
I cause. Analyzed individuals of Cacopsylla spp. were captured in 2006-2011 at
zimovistich, where I piezim in the imdga stage, usually on needles. During
of the years studied was the most abundant measure of Cacopsylla pruni, which was
caught 346 kusti. The occurrence of C. melanoneura was comparable, namely 316 kust. On the contrary
the least occurring species was C. picta (141 pieces caught). Different occurrence
C. melanoneura and C. picta were also described by Jarausch et al. (2007), which ranges from 2002 to 2007
captured these two species in Germany, northern France and northern Switzerland. In the process
150 to 1 500 kustt of C. melanoneura and only 15 to
500 kusti C. picta. The capture of Cacopsylla pruni culminated in black and white, which is due to the increase
temperatures and peace migration to the saddle. Furthermore, a large number of individuals of this species have been captured
at the turn of August and when the measure migrates back to the winter. Capturing C. picta culminated

during the month of December and from March. This more likely capture is likely related
C. melanoneura was most active in December and January and its capture was therefore the most true
in this period. This fact may be related to the fact that this is the first time
from the phytoplasma of fruit girls, which will reactivate after peeling
(Navratil et al., Http://www.lmbm.upol.cz). Tedeschi et al. (2002) studied in 1999
and 2000 population dynamics of C. melanoneura in orchards. They stated that in 1999 he was
the biggest capture of the overwhelming measure in the first half of March and at the beginning of April. In the year 2000

the capture culminated in the period from the end of the tinor to the end of March. It should be noted that

44

The capture of measures is strongly influenced by climatic conditions. In case of higher temperatures
in the winter months, measures are more active, and therefore their capture is larger. On the contrary, pii
at sub-zero temperatures, the capture is hampered, because the measures fall into the S8térbin in the needle,
where they often freeze and cannot be caught. During 2006 and 2011, 22% were detected at the OlSany winter resort
positive individuals of Cacopsylla pruni. Positive males and females were approximately the same
quantities: 21% males and 23% females. This winter seems to be a dilesity reserve
Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum. It was thus possible to confirm that in European countries it has
Phytoplasm of European Seedlings of stone fruit of great epidemiological significance (Carraro et al.,
1998; Jarausch et al., 2001). They watched in winter and in orchards in southern Moravia
numbers of positive individuals of C. pruni and Fialova et al. (2007). They detected on winter
maximum 13.3% of positive individuals, ie less than Z was detected in this area
dissertation. In the orchards, the number of positives ranged up to 33.3%. The number of infected C. pruni individuals in orchards was also observed by Jarausch et al. (2007b). They found that the phytoplasm of European stonegrass seedlings contain 2 - 3%

captured measurements. They confirmed that the vector C. pruni has for Siteni Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum in Germany of great importance. They described a higher percentage of positive measures, 8.6%
Carraro et al. (2004). Tedeschi et al. (2006) in one of their studies found out whether
in the orchards in the second half of March there are also other stages of the development of
contained the phytoplasm of the European Seedlings. They found that yes. ESFY detected in
(3 of 18 custar), larvae (3 of 16 custard) and new generation adults (3 of 25
kusu). In overwintering individuals, ESFY was detected in 18 of 31 pifpadt, which is 2.6 times more
nezZ was detected during the elaboration of the submitted work. In 71 individuals of Cacopsylla pruni in which Candidatus phytoplasm was detected
Phytoplasma prunorum, absolute quantification of this phytoplasm was performed. To be
To obtain the most accurate results, quantification of each sample was performed twice
and from these two obtained results a primary amount of phytoplasmic copifs was calculated
married individual. In male C. pruni, a phytoplasma concentration was found in the range
1 to Z 6538 156 copies, for females in the range of 1 to 4 092 739 copies. In both pifpads, therefore
it was a concentration of tad 10! up to 10 ° of the phytoplasma genome in each individual. Thus, quantification did not show that the content of the phytoplasm in the individual depended on his sex. OvSem

The results of ESFY quantification in C. pruni show that the phytoplasm occurs in the vector

45

in relatively small quantities (ie up to 1,000 copies per individual) or vice versa
repeated (ie over 1000 kopips per individual). Pii ¢ emzZ „nizkokopiovych“ malts and females
(13 males of a6samic) were detected more than high-copy (34 males)
and 18 females). The question therefore arises as to whether European phytoplasms are an effective vector
Seed jaundice only individuals with phytoplasma content over 1,000 copies and equal individuals
with a phytoplasma content of up to 1000 copies, they are mere hosts or are effective
vectors in all C. pruni individuals in which ESFY was detected. On the quantification of Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum in C. pruni's vectors
currently only very few. However, it is possible that the situation is similar for an individual
C. picta and C. melanoneura, © of which more are known. Martini et al. (2007) proposed a procedure
for quantification of ESFY in C. pruni hosts and individuals based on real-time PCR
using primers: rpLNS2f / rpLNS2r2. When applying this procedure, they determined the amounts
European phytoplasmas Seedlings of stone fruit in merdch in the range of 1,07.10 ’and% 4,24.10’ kopif. Furthermore, the quantification of Ca. P. prunorum in hosts and vectors was occupied by Jarausch et al. (2010). These used primers to quantify phytoplasm by real-time PCR
ECAI / ECA2. Using this pair of primers, they detected the concentration of ESFY in the vectors
¥ Copies between 10 ° and 10 °. Other studies dealing with the quantification of phytoplasmas studied by me have already been
focused on Candidatus Phytoplasma mali. Jarausch et al. (2007) as part of a study evaluator
The efficiency of the C. picta and C. melanoneura vectors was used by quantitative PCR, which he determined below
phytoplasm content of apple proliferation in C. picta individuals in the amount of 10 ° to 10 °
one individual. Pedrazzoli et al. (2007) monitored the concentration of Ca. P. small
in C. picta and C. melanoneura after their weighted rearing on infected
apple trees. The results of the study showed that the concentration of phytoplasma is more pronounced
the first of the named vectors. Thebaud et al. (2008) watched it change
phytoplasmic concentration in the vector during its piezimization. They came to the door, In time

overwintering, the phytoplasm multiplies in the vector, and therefore this vector

 

return to orchards able to Sifit phytoplasm to new hosts. Jarausch et al. (2010)
with the help of quantitative PCR they also monitored the activity of acquisition and multiplication of phytoplasm proliferation
apple trees in C. picta individuals, based on Gehoz, studied the interaction between AP and its

vector. 46

In this study, 20% of Cacopsylla picta positive individuals were detected,
respectively 10% positive malts and 19% positive females. Such different quantities
positive males and females have not yet been described. However, the individuals of this measure were
relatively small quantities (141 in total) were captured, so the results cannot be deduced
unambiguous conclusions. Between 2002 and 2007, Jarausch et al. (2007a) followed which
Candidatus Phytoplasma were used in Germany, northern
France and northern Switzerland. They found that in ptenos phytoplasm in the studied
localities are probably applied only by C. picta, in which 10% positive were detected
individuals, which means half the number of positive individuals compared to winter in OlSany
and Bukoviné. Positive C. melanoneura were detected only 2 pieces from several hundreds
captured. Baric et al. (2010), which dealt with
study of the molecular epidemiology of the phytoplasm of apple proliferation in orchards
in southern Tyrol. Using real-time PCR, they detected the phytoplasm of apple proliferation
in 11.1% of individuals of this measure. The studied phytoplasm was also detected in 0.6% of individuals
C. melanoneura. It was confirmed that the potential vector Candidatus Phytoplasma mali
Cacopsylla melanoneura is also of great epidemiological importance in the Czech Republic. The proportion of positive individuals in the winter during the observed years reached 9%,
The number of positive males was equal to 9% and positive females more than
doubles - specific 19%. The results of studies in northern Italy also show that it is here as well
C. melanoneura is a major factor in the Sifeni phytoplasm of apple proliferation. Even
considers that in this locality it is one of the main vectors of AP. And you know that
positive individuals. C. melanoneura here was lower than in winter in OlSany, specifically
3 to 4% of the total amount of traps caught (Tedeschi et Alma 2004). On the contrary
experiments in Germany (Mayer et al. 2009) and South Tyrol (Wolf et al. 2003) showed that
C. melanoneura cannot infect healthy plants and is therefore not important as a vector. These large differences in the results of individual studies can be due to the existence of different ones
population of C. melanoneura, which li8i in the ability to infect with phytoplasm proliferation
apple trees and pass it on to new hosts (Mayer et al. 2009). On the other hand, it was found
Candidatus Phytoplasma mali is genetically highly variable (Schneider et Seemiiller,
2009), and therefore dd assume that some strains can be transferred to help

C. melanoneura and some help C. picta. However, this hypothesis must be verified by study

47

insulated Ca. P. had from different geographical localities and vector populations. German and German
(2004) studied the activity of phytoplasmic transmission of apple proliferation by individual developmental
C. melanoneura stage. They used the method of phytoplasm detection using nested PCR to study
and random random PCR-RFLP analysis verified the presence of Ca. P. small. DoSli
to conclude that wintering adults have a greater role in sieving this phytoplasm in orchards
if not larvae and adults of a new generation. As a further procedure for the detection of molecular epidemiology by European phytoplasmas
I propose to analyze stone fruit jaundice and apple proliferation and bionomy
situation in orchards. In particular, you need to find out how the phytoplasma concentration changes
in vectors after the hibernation period. Whether the phytoplasm is multiplying and what it will have on it
dal8i Siteni effects. This study could not be included in one diploma thesis,
because these are Gas-related experiments, in which each is an individual

vector processed separately ’. 48

As part of my diploma thesis, I developed a literary research on the topic of molecular
epidemiology Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni and Candidatus Phytoplasma mali. In the experimental part I dealt with the detection of the phytoplasma Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni
and Candidatus Phytoplasma should be aided by nested PCR. In addition, I am in the C. pruni vector
determined the phytoplasm concentration of European stoneworms by quantitative PCR. I used the highly sensitive nested method to detect phytoplasmas in vectors
PCR using primers P1 / P7 and R16F2 / R16R2. The results of this analysis showed that
studied phytoplasmas occurred in a high number of individuals. I'm with Cacopsylla pruni
detected 22% of positive individuals, 20% of C. picta vectors and C. melanoneura
9% of individuals. I confirmed that these types of majf in the Czech Republic are marked
epidemiologically significant. In Cacopsylla pruni individuals in which phytoplasm was detected, I am equal to Z
performed quantification. Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum occurred in this vector
in quantity 10! and% 10 ° kopif per individual, in which z emzZ occurred in it in relative
small quantities (up to 1000 copies) or large quantities (over 1000 copies). At the same time, the quantification did not show that the content of the phytoplasm in the individual depended on his

sex. 49

Psyllids - vectors of fruit tree phytoplasmas - were studied in overwintering site, locality
OlSany (south Moravia, Czech Republic) over the years 2006-2010. The population
dynamics of Cacopsylla pruni (Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum vector), C. picta and
C. melanoneura (both Candidatus phytoplasma mali vectors) was monitored as well as
incidence of phytoplasma positive individuals was pursued by PCR / RFLP analysis. Using
a sweeping net on a long stick total 803 individuals of above mentioned vectors were
collected. It was confirmed that conifers (Picea abies as the dominant species in the area)
growing in the investigated highland site of middle Moravia harbor C. pruni, C. picta and
C. melanoneura during the winter season. It was enlarged knowledge about seasonal
migration of three studied psylllid species. Sum of captured individuals varied from year to
year depending on population density, seasonal migration of psyllids and their activity, and
weather. C. picta was less frequently captured of three phytoplasma vectors studied. The
presence of the phytoplasma positive individuals reached 22% for C. pruni (Candidatus
Phytoplasma prunorum), 15% for C. picta, and 14% for C. melanoneura (both Candidatus
phytoplasma mali). The work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech
Republic (grant No. OC 10034) and Ministry of Agriculture (grant No. QJ1210209).
