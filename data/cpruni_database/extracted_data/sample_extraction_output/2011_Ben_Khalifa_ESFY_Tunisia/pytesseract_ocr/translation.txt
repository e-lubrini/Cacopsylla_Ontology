First report of Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum infecting almonds in Tunisia Mekki Ben Khalifa Hatem Fakhfakh Received: 16 March 2011 /Accepted: 14 April 2011 /Published online: 15 May 2011 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011 Abstract Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum was detected for the first time in almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) cv. ‘Abiod’ in Tunisia. Infected trees showed emergence of new growth during dormancy and leafed out before flowers opened in addition to early defoliation in summer, Phytoplasma was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal phytoplasma primer pairs P1/P7 and F2n/R2. A band with expected size was observed in samples collected from five symptomatic, but not symptomless almond trees. PCR products (1.2 kbp) were used for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis after digestion with endonucleases Rsal and SspI. RFLP patterns obtained were similar to those reported previously for the European stone fruit yellows (ESFY, 16SrX-B). Identification has been further confirmed by PCR using ESFY specific primer pairs (ECA1/ECA2). This is the first report of Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum infecting almonds in Tunisia.

Fakhfakh Laboratoire de Génétique Moléculaire Immunologie et Biotechnologie, Faculté des Sciences de Tunis, Tunis El-Manar, 2092 Tunis, Tunisie e-mail: benkhalifamekki@gmail.com Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum (Seemiiller and Schneider 2004), formerly European stone fruit yellows (ESFY), is the causal agent of many economically important decline diseases of stone fruit species in Europe (Jarausch et al. 1998). Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum belongs to subgroup B of the apple proliferation group (16SrX-B) (Lee ef al. 1998). The most common hosts of ESFY phytoplasma include apricots (Morvan 1977), plum (Giunchedi ef al. 1982), peach (Pollini e¢ a/. 2001) and almond (Lederer and Seemiiller 1992; Lorenz et al. 1994). The characteristic disease symptoms of ESFY on almonds include early defoliation in summer and new sprouting in winter followed by dieback within a few years of the first symptoms (Lederer and Seemiiller 1992; Lorenz et al. 1994). Almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) is widely grown in Tunisia, which ranks second among African countries and seventh in the world, with an annual fruit production of 60,000 tons, or 3% of the world almond production (Anon. 2011). Almonds represent 20% of Tunisian stone fruit production, most of which is for local consumption and only 4% of which is exported, mainly to Libya and European countries (Anon. 2011). Recently, disease symptoms resembling those caused by ESFY phytoplasma were observed on almonds in the Ras Jebel area (northem Tunisia), This study aimed to confirm ESFY phytoplasma etiology of almond syndrome in Tunisia. To achieve this, PCR ® Springer 412 Phytoparasitica (2011) 39:411-414. analysis using universal and ESFY-specific primer pairs and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were applied. Samples of leaves were collected during summer 2010 from almond trees of the local cultivar ‘Abiod’ growing in Ras Jebel area. Ten trees were sampled from the same almond orchard, five of which showed disease symptoms and the remaining five trees were symptomless. Phytoplasma reference strains were maintained on the experimental host Catharanthus roseus (periwinkle) and used as positive control in this study. These strains included apple proliferation (AP, 16SrX-A), European stone fruit yellows (ESFY, 16SrX-B) and pear decline (PD, 16SrX-C) phytoplasma (Lee et al. 1998). Total DNA, used as template in PCR reactions, was extracted from approximately 1 g of freshly prepared midribs. DNA from phytoplasma strains used as controls was obtained from petioles and midribs of infected C. roseus plants. Nucleic acids were isolated according to the phytoplasma enrichment procedure described by Ahrens and Seemiiller (1992). Nested PCR amplification of phytoplasma 16S tDNA was carried out with universal primers P1/P7 (Deng and Hiruki 1991; Schneider et al. 1995) and F2n/R2 (Gundersen and Lee 1996). Non-ribosomal primers ECA1/ECA2 (Jarausch et al. 1998) were also used for ESFY-specific detection. The PCR reaction was performed in 25 jl reaction volumes containing 20 ng DNA, 0.4 mM of each primer, 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl, and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France) with the manufacturer’s supplied buffer. Thermocycling was performed using a Peltier thermocycler (Hybaid, Teddington, UK) for 40 cycles with 1 min each for denaturation, annealing and extension. In the final cycle the extension step was extended to 10 min. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels containing 0.5 pg ml! ethidium bromide and visualized using a UV transilluminator. The molecular weight of the PCR products was determined by comparison with 1 Kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen, Toulouse, France). For RFLP analysis, nested PCR products (10-12 11) were digested with Rsal and Sspl restriction enzymes (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Digested fragments were separated either on 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained on ethidium bromide or on 2%. D Springer agarose gels containing 0.5 ug ml”! ethidium bromide and visualized under the UV light. The molecular weight of the fragments was determined by comparison with 1 Kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen). RFLP patterns were compared with those obtained from the phytoplasma reference strains and the RFLP patterns previously published (Lee ef al. 1998). Almond trees of the local cultivar ‘Abiod’ showed disease symptoms recalling those caused by European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) phytoplasma. Infected trees exhibited emergence of new growth during dormancy and leafed out before flowers opened, in addition to early defoliation in summer. Universal nested-PCR assay yielded a characteristic band of approximately 1.2 kbp from all symptomatic almond samples tested and from samples infected by reference phytoplasma strains used as positive controls. No amplification was obtained from any of the symptomless trees (data not shown). Rsal and Sspl restriction profiles obtained from diseased almond trees were indistinguishable from each other and similar to those of European stone fruit yellows (ESFY, Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum) positive control (Fig. 1), but differed from the patterns given by the pear decline phytoplasma (PD, Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri) (Fig. 1a) and apple proliferation phytoplasma (AP, Candidatus Phytoplasma mali) (Fig. 1b). PCR analysis using ESFY-specific primer pair ECAI/ECA2 revealed an amplification of 273 bp from all symptomatic almond samples tested. From ESFY phytoplasma used as a positive control, no amplification was observed with AP and PD phytoplasma positive controls. These results were taken as evidence that all tested symptomatic almond trees of the local cultivar “Abiod’ were infected by Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum, a new record for Tunisia. Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum has been reported to infect several stone fruit species (Jarausch et al. 1998). Thus, knowledge on the transmission mode of the pathogen needs to be improved, in order to define efficient control strategies against ESFY infections in Tunisia, European stone fruit yellows phytoplasmas have been reported to be transmitted by Cacopsylla pruni (Carraro et al, 1998). Since C. pruni is not observed in Tunisia, other studies are needed to identify the Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum vector in Tunisia. Phytoparasitica (2011) 39:411-414 413.
