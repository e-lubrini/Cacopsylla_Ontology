Abstract
Abstract
The European stone fruit yellows disease caused by Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum was identified in peach and nectarine Spanish orchards. The incidence of
the disease in the affected plots ranked between 5 and 25%. The main symptoms observed were chlorosis, leaf roll, decline and occasionally death of the tree. The
insect vector of Ca. P. prunorum, the psillid Cacopsylla pruni, was found in affected plots of Catalonia and Extremadura from March to July. The maximum
population was found during the month of May and the first weeks of June, depending of the area. The mean percentage of individuals of C. pruni carriers of the
phytoplasma was around 10% in Extremadura, 15% in plots of Baix Llobregat (Catalonia) and 7% in plots of Ribera d​Ebre (Catalonia). Individuals of C. pruni have
not been identified yet in the fruit tree area of Lleida (Catalonia) where the incidence of the disease is low.
