Abstract—A faunal list of Psyllinae of the Republic of Altai is given. Out of the 59 species reported, 35 are new to
the fauna of the area under study, 10 are new to Siberia, and 3 are recorded for the first time from Russia. DOI: 10.1134/S0013873808030032

Though a great deal of data on the psyllid fauna of
Siberia (Gegechkori and Loginova, 1990) are avail-
able, this group has not been systematized in a faunal
review of this area. The present study is the first stage
in the investigation aimed with generalization of pub-
lished and new data on the species composition of the
psyllid fauna of various regions of Siberia. Twenty-four psyllid species were recorded from
various areas of the Republic of Altai by Loginova,
who conducted a thorough investigation of the psyllid
fauna of the Soviet Union in 1950-1970 (Loginova,
1961, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1972, 1974,
1979). The collection of the Zoological Institute, Russian
Academy of Sciences (ZIN) also contains unpublished
material on the fauna of the Republic of Altai,
collected by ILM. Kerzhner, A.F. Emeljanov, and
E.P. Nartshuk in 1964 from Ongudaiskii and Kosh-
Agachskii districts, by the author of the present paper
and N.V. Golub in the period of 23.VI-2.VII.2006
from Chemalskii district (near Edigan Vill. ), by
A.V. Barkalov in 2006 from Kosh-Agachskii district
(Kuraiskaya steppe), A.N. Zhelokhovtsev in 1935 and
V.S. Sorokina in 2005 from Ust-Ulaganskii district,
A.A. Silantiev in 1897 from Turochakskii district
(Lake Teletskoe), G. Gorbunova in 1927 from Ust-

Koksinskii district (Uimonskii highway), and
K.V. Yuganova in 1911 from Shebalinskii district
(Seminskii Pass). Basing on this material,

35 species are indicated for the first time for the Re-
public of Altai, 10 species, for Siberia, and 3 species
(Craspedolepta radiosa Loginova, 1982, C. costulata
Loginova, 1962, and C. medvedevi Loginova, 1962),
for Russia. Thus, the total faunal list of psyllids of the Republic
of Altai includes 59 species. Data on these species are
given below, including indications of the locality and
date of their collection, name of the collector, number
of specimens, in some cases, also names of plants,
from which the psyllids were collected, and informa-
tion about published records of the species within the
limits of the Republic of Altai. The collecting sites are
shown in a map of the Republic of Altai (see figure). Data on the distribution of species are based on the
catalogues by Klimaszewski (1973) and Gegechkori
and Loginova (1990), and also on the material from
the collection of ZIN. The following designations are used in text: *spe-
cies is recorded for the first time in the fauna of the
Republic of Altai, **recorded for the first time in the
fauna of Siberia, and ***recorded for the first time in
the fauna of Russia. Family PSYLLIDAE

dus sp., 29.V1.2006 (Labina), 1 3. Distribution. Widely in the Palaearctics, northern
India. The psyllid fauna of the Republic of Altai is richest
among those of the other areas of Siberia. This fact is
accounted for by a great number of the species shared
by adjacent regions of Eastern Kazakhstan and north-
western Mongolia. The fauna comprises slightly less
than half of the species richness of the fauna of entire
Siberia (137 species). The psyllid fauna of the republic
is presented only by two out of the six known psyllid
families, these are Psyllidae Low, 1888 and Triozidae
Léw, 1888, including all the known representatives of
the psyllid fauna of Siberia. The first family includes
three subfami in the fauna of Altai, and the second
one, one subfamily. Most of the species recorded in the Republic of Al-
tai were also found in adjacent areas of Kazakhstan
(East Kazakhstan, Semipalatinsk and Taldy-Kurgan
provinces) and Mongolia (Uvs, Bayan-Olgiy, Hovsgol,
and Hovd aimaks), but did not occur in close territo-
ries of Siberia. This can be accounted for by the fact
that the psyllid fauna of Siberia is studied to a lesser
extent than the faunas of the countries listed above. The territory of the Republic of Altai is also very ir-
regularly studied with respect to the fauna of psyllids:
plenty of material have been collected from restricted
areas of Kosh-Agachskii, Ongudaiskii and Chemalskii
districts, whereas psyllids collected from the other
districts are presented in the ZIN collection only by
separate specimens of several species, and collections
from Choiskii, Maiminskii, and Ust-Kanskii districts
are absent at all. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
