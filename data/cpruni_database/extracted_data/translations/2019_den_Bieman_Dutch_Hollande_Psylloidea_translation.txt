FIRST CHECKLIST OF THE DUTCH JUMPING PLANT LICE SINCE

93 YEARS (HEMIPTERA: PSYLLOIDEA)

Kees den Bieman, Igor Malenovsky, Daniel Burckhardt & Theodoor Heijerman

For a long time, Dutch entomologists showed limited interest in jumping plant lice
(or psyllids). The most recent species list of the Netherlands dates back to 1926. Since then only a few short papers have appeared. This is surprising as some species
are important agricultural pests. The pear psyllid causes harvest loss worth several tens
of million euros every year. We critically checked previous reports on Dutch psyllids. ‘Twenty-seven species are reported here for the first time from the Netherlands and

15 species are omitted from the list. This brings the number of confirmed, established

psyllid species to 69. INTRODUCTION

Psyllids or jumping plant lice (Hemiptera:
Sternorrhyncha: Psylloidea) (fig, 1, 2) are a small
group of around 4000 species worldwide. Fauna
Europaea lists almost 400 species in Europe
(Burckhardt 2013). Adult psyllids range from 1-

10 mm in body length. They are always winged
(with usually ewo pairs of wings) with a character-
istic venation. The head bears short to very long
antennae, usually with ten segments and a pair
of terminal setae. The hind legs are modified for
jumping, with the metacoxae generally greatly
enlarged and fused to the metathorax. Psyllid
immatures (fig. 3, 4) look quite different from the

 

adults, as they are usually dorso-ventrally flac-
tened. There are five instars, the last three have
distinct wing buds. The immatures are mobile,
but often moving only up to a few centimeters
on the hostplant (Ossiannilsson 1992, White &
Hodkinson 1982). FEEDING

Payllids feed on phloem sap of vascular plants. The great majority of species are narrowly host-
specific, i.e. for their development they are de-
pendent on one (= monophagous) or a few closely
related (= narrowly oligophagous) plant species

(Burckhardt et al. 2014b, Hodkinson 1974a)..
Closely related psyllid species often develop on
related plant taxa, suggesting co-speciation be-
tween psyllids and their host plants (Ouvrard et
al, 2o15b). Adult psyllids are more mobile than
the immatures and can be found on other plant
species than their hosts, including shelter plants
(often conifers) used by many psyllid species

for overwintering (Burckhardt et al. 2014b,
Hodkinson 2009). True polyphagy is known from
less than a handful of Bactericera species, e.g. B. cockerelli (Sule, 1909) and B. nigricornis
(Foerster, 1848) (Triozidae), and Russelliana solanicola
Tuthill, 1959 (Psyllidae) (Burckharde & Lauterer
1997b, Hodkinson 1981, Ouvrard et al. 2015b,
Serbina et al. 2015a). The plant families which host most psyllids are
perennial dicots like Fabaceae, Myrtaceae, Aster-
aceae, Rutaceae and Anacardiaceae (Ouvrard et al. 2015b). Those associated with monocots, such as
the Holatctic Livia (Liviidae) on Juncus and Carex
species (Hodkinson & Bird 2000), or conifers,
such as the Neotropical Ehrendorferiana (Psyllidae)
on Austrocedrus and Fitzroya (Cupressaceae)
(Burckhardt 200sb), are exceptions. No psyllids
are known from mosses, ferns and related groups

(Ouvrard et al. 2015b). Figure 2. Cacopsylla fiulguralis. Koudekerke (province of Zeeland). Photo Albert de Wilde. Figuur 2. Cacopsylla fulguralis. Koudekerke (Zeeland). Foto Albert
de Wilde. OVIPOSITION

Payllids deposie their eggs one by one ot in clusters
on the hose plant. Depending on the species, eggs
are laid on the new buds, in crevices of the bark
or on leaves. Immatures of many species prefer
specific feeding sites and are usually concentrated
on parts with active growth: new leaves, flowers
and sometimes even roots (Lauterer & Baudys
1968). Immatures secrete wax and honeydew,
sometimes in large quantities. GALLS

Gall-inducing species are well-represented among
the Psylloidea, but their distribution is taxonomi-
cally and geographically uneven (Burckhardt
2005a). For example, species of the large genus
Cacopsylla (Psyllidae) only rarely induce galls,
whereas most of the Livia species and many
Calophya species (Calophyidae) do. Psyllid galls
(fig, 5, 6) are known since the 16th century (Conci
1998, Weeda et al. 1994). The systematics, biology
and ecology of cecidogenous psyllids were re-
viewed by Hodkinson (1984) and Burckharde
(20054), including references to the most impor-
tant historical literature, description of the types
of galls, the physiology of gall induction and
ecological and economic aspects of psyllid galls. NEDERLANDSE FAUNISTISCHE MEDEDELINGEN 53 — 2019

Psyllids communicate with substrate-born vibra-
tions. These signals are surprisingly diverse (Eben
et al. 2015, Percy 2005, Tishechkin 2006b). They
are the primary mechanism for mate recognition
and mate location (Percy et al. 2006). Tishechkin
(1989, 2006a, 2007a,b) and Eben et al. (2015)
described acoustic behaviour and illustrated
sounds of several European species. PESTS

Burckhardt (1994) and Percy (2014) present
reviews of psyllids as pests of crop and ornamental
plants. There are a few major and many minor
pests. Among the most serious pests of citrus
in Asia and the Americas is Diaphorina citri
Kuwayama, 1908 (Liviidae) which vectors ‘Candi-
datus Liberibacter asiaticus’, the causal agent of
huanglongbing (i118, or citrus greening) (Burck-
harde 1994, Halbert & Manjunath 2004). Several
phytoplasma transmitting Cacopsylla species cause
economic damage to apple, pear and stone fruit
orchards in Europe and East Asia (Burckharde &
Hodkinson 1986, Burckhardt & Lauterer 2009,
Cho et al. 2017a,b, Seemiiller et al. 2011, Steffek
et al. 2012). In Europe, several, probably poly-
phagous, Bactericera species (Triozidac) damage
crops: B, tremblayi (Wagner, 1961) on onions and

on various vegetables (Hodkinson 1981), and

B, trigonica Hodkinson, 1981 on carrots; the last
are also harmed by Trioza apicalis Foerster, 1848
(Triozidae) (Burckhardt & Freuler 2000, Laska
1974 2011). In North and Central America and, in New
Zealand (introduced), Bactericera cockerelli (Sule,
1909) is a major pest on potatoes and tomatoes by
transmitting ‘Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’,
the causal agent of zebra chip (Munyaneza et al. 2007). Feeding activities of psyllids may also
weaken the host plant, making it more susceptible
to diseases. In South America (Burckhardt et al. 1999, Queiroz et al. 2013, 2018, Queiroz & Burck-
hardt 2007) and Europe (Hodkinson 1999, 2007,

 

Laudonia & Garonna 2010, Laudonia et al. 2014),
eucalypt trees are seriously damaged by the
feeding activities of several introduced psyllid
species. The feeding may result in excess honeydew
which may cover leaves, fruits and flowers. This
honeydew is often covered with black sooty
mould which may impair photosynthesis and also
renders fruits unmarketable (Burckharde 1994). BIOCONTROL

Some psyllids have been used or are considered
for the control of invasive weeds. Examples are
the Australian weed Melaleuca quinguenervia
(Myrtaceae) in Florida with Boreioglyeaspis mela-
leucae Moore, 1964 (Aphalaridae) (Morath et al. 2006) and the Brazilian peppertree Schinus
terebinthifolius in Florida with Calophya latiforceps
Burckhardt, 2011 from Brazil (Burckhardt et al. 2018). Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica is
invasive in most western European countries and
has a severe impact upon biodiversity. Biocontrol
research was initiated in Britain resulting in the
release of the eastern Asian psyllid Aphalara itadori
(Shinji, 1938) (Prac et al. 2013, Shaw et al. 2011). ‘This was the first official intentional release of a
non-native biological agent to control an invasive
plane in Europe (Shaw et al. 2016, cast 2018a). In the Netherlands research is ongoing and a
decision on the release of this psyllid will soon
be made (Jones et al. 2013). ALIEN (EXOTIC) SPECIES

‘The number of psyllids thae is unintentionally
introduced into Europe has increased in the last
decades. Mifsud et al. (2010) listed 14 species alien
to Europe. The majority is associated with Asian
and Australian species of the genera Eucalyptus,
Acacia and Albizia. Among the recently discov-
ered introductions are Macrohomotoma gladiata
Kuwayama, 1908 (Homoromidae) in Spain and
Italy (Mifsud & Porcelli 2012, Pedata et al. 2012)
and Platyobria biemani Burckhardt et al., 2014
(Aphalaridae) in Greece (Burckhardt et al. 2014a). Because of the growing international trade in

 

 

 

NEDERLANDSE FAUNISTISCHE MEDEDELINGEN 53 — 2019

 

agricultural products and ornamental plants,

in combination with insufficient phytosanitary
controls, we predict the arrival and establishment
of more psyllid species in the future. When appropriate, the alien status for Durch
psyllids is given based on the definition of Dutch
Species Register (2019). CLASSIFICATION

The classification of the world’s jumping plant-
lice by Burckhardt & Ouvrard (2012), dividing
the superfamily into eight families, is adopted
here. Nomenclature of psyllids follows Ouvrard
(2018), that of the plants Van der Meijden (2005). DUTCH PSYLLOIDEA

There has always been only limited interest in
the Dutch psyllid fauna, besides studies on some
agricultural pests on apple, pear and Buxus (Wilcke
1941). The first list of psyllid species in the
Netherlands was by De Graaf et al. (1862) who
reported eight species. Van der Goot (1912) pub-
lished the second list with 27 species. His lise

was based on the first one, including notes of
G.A. Six and some additional material. However,
for some new species no distribution data were
given. Van der Goot was forced to finish his work
prematurely by his leave for the Dutch East Indies. Figure 6. Galls of Trioza flavipennis

hy. The most recent list is by Blite (1926b) counting
29 species. Since then some additional species
were added and ecological information was
provided (Bléte 1926a, 1926c, 1950, Coben 1951,
Docters van Leeuwen 1947, Van Frankenhuyzen
& Freriks 1972, Gravestein 1944a,b, 1951, Lauterer
& Malenovsky 2002, Wilcke 1941, Woudstra
1996). The paper by Bléte (1926a) was written in Dutch,
which created some confusion. In addition to the
confirmed Dutch species, Blate listed many other
species whose occurrence in the Netherlands he
considered possible or which might be imported
with horticultural plants. Some subsequent authors
misinterpreted this paper and wrongly listed all
species as members of the Dutch fauna, e.g. the
mediterranean species Arytaina adenocarpi Low,
1880 by Klimaszewski (1973). Blate (1926b) in-
dicated species that he himself had not seen with
a question mark, but stated that he had no doubt
on their identification made by colleagues. This
question mark is the reason why some species
have been unjustly listed as doubeful for the
Netherlands in Fauna Europaea (Burckhardt 2013). Much information on the Dutch gall-producing
payllids was summarized by Docters van Leeuwen
(2009) and Grosscurt (2017). Ellis (2018) illus-
trates many galls of psyllids recorded in the
Netherlands. DEN BIEMAN ET AL. ~ CHECKLIST OF THE DUTCH JUMPING PLANT LICE

 

  

‘The species list in this paper is mainly based on
material from the collection of the first author,
the former collection of the Laboratory of
Entomology of Wageningen University, and the
former collection of the Zodilogisch Museum in
Amsterdam. The last two collections are now part
of the collection of Naturalis Biodiversity Center
in Leiden (abbreviated as col. Naturalis in this
paper). Species are omitted from the list when
they are mentioned in the literature as occurring
in the Netherlands, but without supporting
material in the collections. Species reported based
only on their galls are incorporated in case a good
picture is available from a Dutch locality. Further-
more records from Waarneming.nl were included
when they had a good photo which could be
identified by the first author. Species that are
reported from the Netherlands for the first time
are marked with ‘(New for the Netherlands)’. Dutch geographical coordinates (Amersfoort-
codrdinaten = ac) are given for the collecting
sites, when available. Unless stated otherwise, the
material was collected and identified by the first
author and preserved in his collection. Photo-
graphs in figures 7-33 were taken by Theodoor
Heijerman; the scale bar equals 0.5 mm. PSYLLIDS AS PESTS IN THE NETHERLANDS

In the Netherlands several psyllid species are
regarded as pests, for which details are given
below. Minor damage can also be caused by
Cacopsylla fulguralis and Pyylla buxi on ornamental
shrubs (Elaeagnus species and Buxus sempervirens,
respectively). In Eurasia and the Americas (introduced) pear
psyllids (Cacopsylla species) are major pests of
cultivated pear (Burckhardt & Hodkinson 1986,
Cho et al. 2017b, Valle et al. 2017). In the Nether-
lands, the yearly losses are estimated at tens of
million euros (Balkhoven 2015). The feeding of
pear psyllids on the flower buds in autumn results
in a reduced harvest the following year. The ex-
cretion of honeydew soils the fruits and promotes

growth of black sooty mould. Pear psyllids are
also vectors of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’, the
causal agent of the pear decline disease which

is widespread in the Netherlands (cast 2018b). Cacopsylla pyri, C. pyricola and C. pyrisuga often
occur together in pear orchards, which can make
it difficult to assess the economic impact of each
species separately. The first two species are poly-
voltine and probably cause most of the damage. In the Netherlands C. pyri is the main pest in
commercial pear orchards (car 2003, Trapman &
Blommers 1992, pers. comm. H. Helsen 2018). Research is ongoing regarding the biological
control of the pear psyllids. The main predators
are the earwig Forficula auricularia (Dermaptera)
and the flower bug Anthocoris nemoralis (Heterop-
tera: Anthocoridae) (Trapman & Blommers 1992). IDENTIFICATION

Both adult and immature psyllids can be identi-
fied to the species level. Unfortunately, there is no
single paper for the identification of the complete
Dutch psyllid fauna. Hodkinson & White (1979),
White & Hodkinson (1982) and especially Os-
siannilsson (1992) are very helpful for identifying
most of the Dutch species. For species not included
in Ossiannilsson (1992) references to literature are
given below. Cacopsylla species associated with
rosaceous host plants, including economically
important species on fruit trees, can be identified
using the pictorial key by Burckharde (2010). ‘A good reference collection is often essential for
reliable identification. ‘The body colouration is often variable within a
species and an individual may change from green
or yellow to red, brown and black over the course
of several months. Overwintering individuals are
often much darker than specimens in summer. Wing venation and surface spinules, together
with the male and female terminalia and the head
morphology, provide the best identification cues
for adults in many cases (Boffing & Bantock
2014, Ossiannilsson 1992). 60

Aphalara is a taxonomically difficult genus. Some
species are hard to identify with morphological
characters only and knowledge of the host plant
is helpful for a reliable identification. The most
relevant paper for the identification of Dutch
Aphalara species is Ossiannilsson (1992). However,
some corrections of the nomenclature in this
paper are necessary:

Aphalara crispicola Ossiannilsson, 1987 is a junior
synonym of A. purpurascens (Hartig, 1841) (Burck-
harde 2008);

Aphalara pauli Loginova, 1979 is A. ulicis Foerster,
1848 (Burckhardt & Lauterer 19974);

Aphalara polygoni Foerster, 1848 is A. freji Burckhardt
& Lauterer, 1997 (Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997a);

Aphalara rumicicola Klimaszewski, 1966 is a
junior synonym of A. polygoni Foerster, 1848
(Burckharde & Lauterer 1997a). Due to the taxonomic confusion, older records
of most Aphalara species are unreliable and
should be reevaluated. Only a small part of the
Dutch collections has been reassessed. Aphalara avicularis Ossiannilsson, 1981

aviculare agg. Aphalara avicularis (fig. 7) is quite common in
the Netherlands, occurring wherever the host-
plant (Polygonum aviculare agg.) grows, e.g. in
roadside verges and on parking lots. These ruderal
localities are often well-trodden which does not
seem to impair the psyllid and its host plants. Ie
has not been collected in the northern parts of
the Netherlands yet but this is probably due to
the shortage of collecting activities. This species is widely distributed in Europe, with
the exception of most mediterranean countries
(Burckhardt 2013, Ossiannilsson 1992, Ripka
2008, Seljak 2006, Serbina et al. 2015b, Skipper
2018). Outside Europe it has been reported from
South Korea (Cho et al. 2017a). Immatures live in the stipulate sheaths at the
branching points of ramification and on the stalks
and leaves, near the top of the shoots (Ossiannilsson
1992). They can cause small pie galls on leaves
(Ellis 2018). Adults have been found in the
Netherlands from June to September. The adults
overwinter on conifers (Ossiannilsson 1992). Ic is a bivoltine species but has perhaps more
generations at some localities (Hodkinson 2009,
Lauterer & Malenovsky 2002). Aphalara freji Burckhardt & Lauterer, 1997

P. amphibia, P. hydropiper, P lapathifolium, P mitis
and P maculosa (Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997),
often in rather humid conditions like the edges of
standing waters, ditches and sea dikes. Sometimes
it is collected at sandy, dry ruderal localities, espe-
cially on P maculosa. Immatures produce small

pit galls on the leaves (Ellis 2018), which are in-
distinguishable from those of A. maculipennis,
sharing the same host species (Burckhardt &
Lauterer 1997a). Only microscopic examination
of fifth-instar immatures (Ossiannilsson 1992) or
rearing to adults can show which species a gall on
P. amphibia and P lapathifolium belongs. However,
it seems that only P freji occurs on P maculosa. In the Netherlands this species was collected from
February until October. It overwinters in the
adule stage on conifers but it can also be collected
on other hiding places, as the collection on fire
wood on February 10, 1918 showed. It has one or
‘two generations a year (Hodkinson 2009). Aphalara polygoni Foerster, 1848

in Europe but is not reported from most mediter-
ranean countries (Burckhardt 2013, O'Connor &
Malumphy 2011, Ripka 2009). Reports from out-
side Europe should be critically evaluated due to
the complex taxonomy (Burckhardt & Lauterer
1997a, Cho et al. 2017a). In the Netherlands Doctors van Leeuwen
(1982, 2009) reported galls on Polygala vulgaris
(Polygalaceae) and attributed them to A. polygoni,
which is unlikely because all confirmed hosts of
A. polygoni are Rumex acetosella, R. acetosa and

R, scutatus (Polygonaceae) (Burckhardt 2002,
Malenovsky & Lauterer 2012, Ossiannilsson
1992). The immatures induce deformations of the
leaf blade (Ellis 2018). Older reports of A. pohgoni
on Persicaria species probably refer to A. freji-
The adults of the bivoltine species A. polygoni
overwinter on conifers (Hodkinson 2009). Aphalara maculipennis Law, 1886

‘The first Dutch record was by Gravestein (19444);
adults were collected in Amsterdam from 13.x to
2.x1.1943. In the Netherlands A. maculipennis is
widely distributed. It has a wide distribution all
over Europe and also in the East Palaearctic and
North Africa (Burckharde & Lauterer 19978,
Burckhardt 2013). Aphalara maculipennis has been reported from
Persicaria amphibia, P lapathifolium and P tomen-
tosum (Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997a). It was
reared out of galls on Persicaria amphibia in Bel-
gium (Ellis 2018) and galls on this host plant were
also reported from the Netherlands by Docters
van Leeuwen (1982, 2009) and Grosscurt (2017). The species is univoltine, the adults overwinter
on conifers (Hodkinson 2009). Aphalara purpurascens (Hartig, 1841)

R, obtusifolius (Malenovsky & Lauterer 2012,
Ossiannilsson 1992). In the Czech Republic it is
bivoltine, the adults overwinter on conifers. The
earliest adults were swept on meadows in mid
April, bur the migration from the conifers to their
host plants takes some time and is completed

at the beginning of June, when the oviposition
starts. Adults of the new generation emerge at the
end of July; immatures of the second generation
can be found in August. Females oviposit on
young unfolded leaves, most often in clusters of
2-3 eggs, up to 7-8 (Lauterer 1982, as A. rumicicola,
see also Lauterer 1993a). Malformations on the
host plants were described by Lauterer (1982) and

Naturalis. Aphalara ulicis (fig. 1) is closely related to A. exilis
(Weber & Moht, 1804) and can be distinguished
from the latter by the pattern of the surface spinules
of the fore wings and details of the male paramere
(Ossiannilsson 1992: as A. pauli, Burckharde &
Lauterer 1997). Aphalara ulicis has been reported from large parts
of Europe but does not occur in most mediter-
ranean countries (Burckhardt 2013, Jerinié-
Prodanovié 2010, O'Connor & Malumphy 201). Based on observations in the Czech Republic,

A. ulicis is more xerothermophilous than A. exilis
and lives mainly in sandy lowland habieats. Aphalara exilis is hygrophilous and psychrophilous
and is restricted to wet meadows, pastures and
bogs (Burckharde & Lauterer 1997a, Malenovsky
& Lauterer 2012). Rumex acetosella is the host
plant of A. ulicis, while A. exilis lives on R. acetosa
and R. obtusifolius (Burckhardt & Lauteret 19972). ‘When flowering starts Aphalara ulicis lays its eggs
on the upper side of the leaves, mainly basally,

along the veins or on the stem in the upper
flowering parts. Eggs are laid mostly one by one. The leaf galls are described by Ellis (2018). The
adults of A. ulicis overwinter on conifers (Boffing
& Bantock 2014). The species probably has one
generation per year. Craspedolepta flavipennis (Foerster, 1848)

man, col, Naturalis. ‘The only previous information on C. flavipennis
(fig. 12) from the Netherlands is by Burckharde
(2013) reporting this species as doubtful for the
country. The record form Maastricht is a confir-
mation that C. flavipennis occurs in the Nether-
lands. Ie is found in western, central and eastern
Europe (Burckhardt 2013, Ripka 2008, Seljak
2006, Serbina et al. 2015b). Leontodon hispidus is the only confirmed host
plant of C: flavipennis, although some additional
Asteraceae species were reported as hosts in the
literature (Lauterer & Burckhardt 2004, Malenovsky
& Lauterer 2012). Craspedolepta flavipennis occurs
in xerothermic, mesic and wet places. Adults

 

emerge over a long period of time, and teneral
specimens can be found from the end of May to
the middle of August. Craspedolepta flavipennis
has a wide altitudinal range, from 140 to 1950 m
a... (Lauterer & Burckhardt 2004). It is a mono-
voltine species, the immatures overwinter on the

Craspedolepta latior (fig. 13) occurs mainly in
central and northern Europe (Burckhardt 2013,
Burckhardt & Lauterer 2009b, Lauterer 1965,
Serbina et al. 2015b), but it has also been recorded
in the East Palaearctic region (Ossiannilsson 1992,
Tishetshkin 2007a). The Dutch record is located
at the western border of the range. The host plants of C. latior are Artemisia vulgaris
in Europe (Burckhardt 2002) and A. sericea in
Siberia (Tishetshkin 20074). Artemisia vulgaris is
avery common plant in the Netherlands (Floron
2015) and it has often been checked by the first
author without finding this psyllid species. Prob-
ably it is a rare psyllid in the Netherlands. The
immatures infest the shoot apices. Fourth and
fifth instars were found at the end of May and
beginning of June and adults can be found be-
tween June and August (Ossiannilsson 1992). Probably it is an univoltine species and the im-
matures overwinter on the host plant, as other
Craspedolepta species. Craspedolepta nebulosa (Zetterstedt, 1828)
New for the Netherlands

Overijssel Weerselo, ac 256-485, 5.V1.1970,1 3,
leg. Gravestein, col. Naturalis. Craspedolepta nebulosa (fig, 14) is a Holarctic
species, known from most northern and central
European countries (Burckhardt 2013, Ouvrard
2018), Turkey, Kazakhstan, Russian Far East and
North America (Drohojowska & Burckhardt
2014, Hodkinson 1988, Ossiannilsson 1992). Its hose plane is Chamerion angustifolium (Burck-
harde 2002, Ossiannilsson 1992). This plant is
very common in the Netherlands (Floron 2015),
but there has been only a single record of this
psyllid. Oviposition takes place in May and June
near the midrib of the underside of a young leaf. The growth of the leaf shifts the eggs to the leaf
margin. This margin curls around the young first
instars. Sometimes oviposition is at the leaf upper

side near the margin and also then the leaf curls
over the eggs and the immatures live under the
curled leaf margins. Before the first moult the
first instars move to the roots of the host. Suction
on the roots results in root galls. After overwin-
tering the fourth instars move upwards to the
leaves. The black fourth instars moult to the yellow-
brown fifth instars at the underside of the leaves
and after 1-2 weeks the adults appear. Craspedolepta
nebulosa is among the few organisms that, during
larval development, produces two different types
of galls on the same host plant. It is a univoltine
species (Hodkinson 2009, Lauterer 1993a, Ossian-
nilsson 1992). Craspedolepta nervosa (Foerster, 1848)

‘A rather common species in the Netherlands,
from where it was first reported by Blite (1926b). Adults were collected from the beginning of
May until the end of July always on Achillea
millefolium (observations by the first author). Craspedolepta nervosa is widespread in Europe
and in the Asian parts of the former ussr (Ossian-
nilsson 1992). It develops on Achillea millefolium
and A. ptarmica but has also been found and
reared on Cirsium arvense (Conci et al. 1993,
Ossiannilsson 1992). It occurs in xerophilous and
mesophilous habitats, including those heavily
affected by man (Lauterer 1993b). It has one gen-
eration per year and overwinters in the larval
stage on the roots of its host plant (Hodkinson

Craspedolepta omissa (fig. 15) is a West Palaearctic
species. It seems to be missing from Scandinavia,
Great Britain and Ireland and most of the mediter-
ranean countries (Burckhardt 2013, Burckhardt &
Onugar 1993, Ripka 2009, Serbina et al. 20r5b,
Tishetchkin 2007a). It lives on Artemisia vulgaris (Burckhardt 1983)
which is one of the most common plants in the
Netherlands on ruderal spots. However, C. omissa
has been only rarely recorded in the Netherlands. Observations in the Czech Republic suggest that
it is locally common on ruderal sites (Lauterer
1993 b, Malenovsky & Lauterer 2012). In Italy
adults were collected from June until August and
immatures were observed in June (Conci et al. 1993). The Dutch samples fit in these data. Probably it is a univoltine species with larvae
overwintering on the roots of its host (Conci et
al. 1993, Hodkinson 2009). For identification see e.g. Burckhardt (1983),

Gillavry and by Blate in 1925 and as C. sonchi by
J.H. Woudstra in 1992 and I. Malenovsky in
2009. Bléte (1926b) reported Aphalara picta (Zetter-
stedt, 1828) from Apeldoorn and Zundere. This
name is a junior synonym of Aphalara calthae
(Ossiannilsson 1951), but it was also used previous
to that publication for C. flavipennis s.1. of which
C. sonchi was considered a synonym. A single
female was available for re-examination. Based on published records, C. sonchi is a Holarctic
species with a wide distribution (Ouvrard 2018),

but records outside Europe should be checked
following the revision of Lauterer & Burckharde
(2004). Confirmed hosts are Leontodon autumnale
and L. hispidus (Lauterer & Burckhardt 2004),
but other Asteraceae are also mentioned in the
literature (Ouvrard 2018). Ic is a univoltine species

plant with C. nebulosa: Chamerion angustifolium. Lauterer & Baudy’ (1968) and Lauterer (19932)
studied the bionomics of this univoltine psyllid. Oviposition takes place in early June at both sides
of the leaves. The young immatures drop on the
soil and feed on the roots, inducing root galls

of about one centimetre in diameter. The dark
coloured fourth instars overwinter in these root
galls. The last instars crawl to the leaves. There

is no gall formation on the leaves or stems. At
medium altitudes in the Czech Republic, the first
adults appear at the end of May and in early
June. In Sweden adults were collected from the
beginning of June until the beginning of August
(Ossiannilsson 1992), the Dutch data fit into this
pattern. For identification see Hodkinson & White (1979)
and Conci & Tamanini (1986). DEN BIEMAN ET AL. ~

Rhinocolinae

Rhinocola aceris (Linnaeus, 1758)

Gravestein (1944b) reported R. aceris for the first
time from the Netherlands (Noord-Holland,
Amsterdam, 8 & 9.v1.1943, several specimens on
Quercus robur. It is a rather common psyllid in
the Netherlands on Acer species. Adults were
collected ftom May until July (data of the first
author). Rhinocola aceris occurs all over Europe (Burck-
harde 2013) and also in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey
and Middle Asia (Burckhardt & Lauterer 1989,
Ossiannilsson 1992). It develops on different Acer
species: A. campestre, A. platanoides, A, pseudo-
platanus and A, tataricum. The life cycle of this
univoltine psyllid was studied in Austria by Low
(1880) and described in detail by Ossiannilsson
(1992). Oviposition takes place in August and
September, beneath the outer bud scales of the
host plane. After hatching the first instar remains
on this site, feeding in the bud axils. The first
instar overwinters in the buds. Other authors
stated that the eggs overwinter (Conci et al. 1993,
Hodkinson 2009). The larval development starts
again at the time of the bud burst, about mid
March. The fourth instar moves to the base of the
young shoots, and remains there until close to the
last moult. Then they move to the underside of
the leaves. Liviidae

Pryllopsis distinguenda Edwards, 1913
New for the Netherlands

Limburg Maasniel (Roermond), ac 198-357,
28.v1.1954, 1d together with 2 fraxini, leg. RH. Cobben, col. Naturalis; Holland, no date,

1 3, leg. Fransen, col. Naturalis (identified by
Blote in 1925 as P fraxini). In Europe, P distinguenda (fig, 17) has been
recorded from most countries but not from
Scandinavia nor from the mediterranean region
(Burckhardt 2013, Lauterer & Eastop 1968,
O'Connor & Malumphy 20m, Seljak 2006, Serbina
et al. 2015). As the other Pryllopsis species, P distinguenda
develops on Fraxinus: F angustifolia, F excelsior
and F oxycarpa (Burckhardt 2002, Lauterer 1982,
Lauterer & Eastop 1968). It overwinters in the
egg stage in twigs of the host. Immatures emerge
at the end of April, leaf galls appear in June and
adults are found from early June onwards. According to Lauterer & Eastop (1968) this
species is univoltine, though Hodkinson (2009)
and Lauterer (1982) considered it a bivoltine
species. The galls of the Psyllopsis species are indis-
tinguishable (Ellis 2018, Ossiannilsson 1992). For an identification key and illustrations of
adults of the Pyyllopsis species see Hodkinson &
White (1979) and Conci & Tamanini (1990). Payllopsis fraxini (Linnaeus, 1758)

De Graaf et al. (1862) mentioned P fraxini from
the Netherlands and it was also listed by Van der
Goot (1912) and Blate (1926b). A rather common
species in the Netherlands, collected from June
until November. It is widely distributed through-
out Europe, Asia Minor and introduced into
North America, New Zealand and Tasmania
(Ossiannilsson 1992, Ouvrard 2018). Like the former species it lives on Fraxinus species
and overwinters in the egg stage in the terminal
buds of Fraxinus twigs (Ossiannilsson 1992). It
has one to two generations a year (Hodkinson
2009). NEDERLANDSE FAUNISTISCHE MEDEDELINGEN 53 — 2019

 

Psyllopsis fraxinicola (Foerster, 1848)

The first Dutch report on F fraxinicola is by Van
det Goot (1912), also Blate (1926b) mentioned
this species. It is the most common Psyllopsis
species in the Netherlands. Adults are collected
from June to November. Pyllopsis fraxinicola is widely discributed through-
out Europe, North Africa, Armenia, Georgia,
Israel and Kazakhstan and it has been introduced
into Australia, New Zealand and North and
South America (Burckhardt 1989, Ossiannilsson
1992, Ouvrard 2018). Payllopsis fraxinicola lives on Fraxinus species
(Ossiannilsson 1992, Ouvrard 2018). The eggs are
laid in summer on the terminal buds of the host
plane, where they overwinter. The eggs hatch with
the bud-burst in spring (Ossiannilsson 1992). Contrary to the former two species, P fraxinicola
does not induce leaf galls, but immatures are
often found in the galls of P fraxini and P dis-
crepans (Ossiannilsson 1992). Like the former
species, it has one to two generations per year
(Hodkinson 2009). Strophingia ericae (Curtis, 1835)

This species was recorded from the Netherlands
by De Graaf et al. (1862), Van der Goot (1912)
and Blate (1926b). Ie is quite common in the
Netherlands. However, it is not often reported on
Waarneming.nl, probably due to its tiny dimen-
sions. With its body length of 0.9-1.6 mm it is by
far the smallest Dutch psyllid. It was collected
from May until September. Strophingia evicae is widely distributed all over
Europe (Burckhardt 2013, Ossiannilsson 1992). It is monophagous on Calluna vulgaris. Whether
it can complete its whole life cycle on other
Ericaceae is unclear (Ossiannilsson 1992). In the
United Kingdom it is a univoltine species at
lowland localities, whereas at upland sites it takes

two years to complete its cycle (Hodkinson et al. 1999). The immatures overwinter on the host. In Sweden immatures were found from March
until November, adults from May until August
(Ossiannilsson 1992). Liviinae

the Caucasus, Turkestan, China and Mongolia
(Ossiannilsson 1992). Camarotoscena speciosa shows variability in colour,
from light to dark brownish fore wings with
dark brown mottling, It lives on Populus species
(P alba, P bakamifera, P. nigra and P tremula)
and their hybrids (Ossiannilsson 1992), other
Populus species are reported from outside Europe
(Ouvrard 2018), In central Europe it prefers

P alba and P. nigra (Lauterer 1993b). It produces
conspicuous pale coloured leaf-roll galls on the
leaves of its host plants, Probably, C. speciosa is a
bivoltine species, the adults overwinter on conifers
and other sheltered places (Hodkinson 2009). In

autumn it is also found inside houses, as the

Gelderland Veenendaal, ac 166-445, 19.1x.1982,
1d, marshy area in a sandpit. Van der Goot (1912) was the first to report L. cre-
(feldensis from the Netherlands referring to two
specimens attributed by De Graaf et al. (1862) t0
L, limbata (Waga, 1842). Van der Goot did not
see this material himself, nor did Bléte (1926b). The reports of L. crefeldensis by Ossiannilsson
(1992) and Hodkinson & Bird (2000) from the
Netherlands referred to Van der Goot (1912) and
Blate (1926a). However, the latter paper written
in Dutch is just an overview of the psyllid species
that occur or might be found in the future in the
Netherlands, without an actual record of L. crefel-
densis. Docters van Leeuwen (1941) reported galls
on Carex attributed to L. crefeldensis from the
Lindevallei (province of Friesland) and Groesbeek. (province of Gelderland). Subsequent editions of
the Gallenboek (Docters van Leeuwen 1957, 1982,
2009) were based on these findings and identified
the host plant species as Carex spicata. However,
in Docters van Leeuwen & Alta (1946) only galls
on Carex muricata were mentioned. The oldest
Dutch report on a gall probably produced by

L, crefeldensis is found on a woodcut by Matthias
de Lobel from 1581 in his Kruydtboeck. It showed
a gall on C. arenaria from Zoutelande (province
of Zeeland) (Weeda et al. 1994, pers. comm. Y, Baugnée). Until now there has been only one
confirmed Dutch record of an adult L. crefeldensis
(see the material cited above). Burckhardt (2013) listed only a limited number
of European countries in which L. crefeldensis

is present: Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great
Britain, Poland, Romania and Sweden. The pres-
ence in the Netherlands was considered doubeful. Hodkinson & Bird (2000) confirmed its presence
in Russia (including Siberia). Ouvrard (2018)

cited a record from Spain but this needs confir-
mation. Livia crefeldensis lives on Carex species. Its galls on
Carex spicata were illustrated by Doctors van
Leeuwen (2009). It is a univoltine species, the
adults overwinter on the host (Hodkinson 2009,
Ossiannilsson 1992). Livia junci (Schrank, 1789)

De Graaf et al. (1862) mentioned L. junci from
the Netherlands and later also Van der Goot
(1912) and Bléte (1926b). It is a very common
species (in Waarneming.nl 359 records of adults
and galls from all over the Netherlands). Adults
were collected from March until November. Livia junci is distributed all over Europe (Burck-
harde 2013). It is also known from the Caucasus,
Kazakhstan, Russian Far East, India, Morocco,
Turkey, Tadzhikistan and Turkmenistan (Hod-
kinson & Bird 2000). Livia junci lives on a number of Juncus species:
J. acutiflorus, J. alpinoarticulatus, J. anceps,

J. articulatus, J. bufonins, J. bulbosus, J. capitatus,
J. conglomeratus, J. effusus, J. gerardii, J. inflexus,
J. jacquinii and J. subnodulosus, In Scandinavia it
has one generation per year but perhaps it has
more generations in the south. The adults over-
winter (Hodkinson 2009, Ossiannilsson 1992),
often on conifers. In spring, eggs are laid in the
shoots of the host plane. After hatching, the
young larvae migrate to the growing points of
the developing shoots and start to induce galls
(Ossiannilsson 1992). The galls were illustrated
by Docters van Leeuwen (1957, 1982, 2009) and
Ellis (2018). Galls induced by L. junci have been
found in the Netherlands on Juncus acutiflorus,
J. alpinoarticulatus (including subsp. atricapillus),
J. articulatus, J. bufonius, J. bulbosus and especially
on J. gerardii (Docters van Leeuwen & Alta 1946,
Doctors van Leeuwen 1982, 2009). NEDERLANDSE FAUNISTISCHE MEDEDELINGEN 53 — 2019

Psyllidae

Arytaina genistae (Latreille, 1804)

De Graaf et al. (1862) reported A. genistae from
the Netherlands as Pyylla ulicis Curtis, 1835 (see
also Van der Goot 1912). It is widely distributed
in the Netherlands occurring at almost every
locality where the common host plane Gytisus

(= Sarothamnus) scoparius grows. Adults have
been recorded almost all year round from March
until December. Arytaina genistae occurs almost all over Europe
and it has been introduced into North America
(Burckhardt 2013, Ossiannilsson 1992). Besides
C. scoparius other Fabaceae were reported as host
plants: C. austriacus, C. heuffelii and Genista
tinctoria; Ulex europaeus is doubtful (Ossiannilsson
1992). According to Ossiannilsson (1992), it is a bivoltine
species, with adults of the second generation
overwintering on the host plant. In Italy, Conci
et al. (1993) found an almost continuous develop-
ment with two or perhaps even three generations
and all stages overwintering on the host plane. Arytainilla spartiophila (Foerster, 1848)

The first report of A. spartiophila from the Nether-
lands was by Van der Goot (1912) as Pyylla spartii
Guérin-Meneville, 1843. This latter name was also
used in Blate (1926b). The species occurs on
Gptisus scoparius as A. genistae but is, in comparison
with the latter, less common in the Netherlands. Adults were collected from May until August. Arytainilla spartiophila is a western European
species that has also been introduced into Australia,
New Zealand and North America (Burckhardt
2013, Ouvrard 2018). It is monophagous on

C. scoparius (Burckhardt 2002, Ossiannilsson

1992). It is a univoltine species, overwintering in
the egg stage. The eggs are laid under developing
buds (Ossiannilsson 1992). Baeopelma foersteri (Flor, 1861)

Van der Goot (1912) reported B. foersteri for the
first time from the Netherlands and also Blote
(1926b) listed it. It is quite common in the Nether-
lands, with adults collected from June until August. Baeopelma foersteri is a western Palaearctic species
occurring in Europe, North Africa and the Near
East (Burckhardt 2013, Ouvrard 2018). It lives on
Alnus glutinosa and A. incana. It is univoltine,
overwintering in the egg stage in the buds of the
host plants. The immatures hatch at the time the
buds stare expanding. They expel their faeces in
a caudal ‘trail’ consisting of a cluster of wax fila-
ments, Ac times this trail is broken and gradually
replaced by a fresh one (Ossiannilsson 1992). The
immatures of B. foersteri are much more agile
than the immatures of the genus Pylla (Lauterer
1998). In the Czech Republic, teneral adults were
found from the beginning of June onwards,
the first copulations were observed in mid June
(Lauterer 1998). Cacopsylla affinis (Liw, 1880)

nilsson 1992) on sunny places, such as forest
margins, often together with C. melanoneura
(Lauterer 1982). The life cycle of both species

is univoltine, the adults overwinter. The adults
leave the host plant as early as mid July and then
migrate to conifers (Lauterer 1982, Hodkinson
2009). During overwintering the colouration

of adults changes from ferruginous and green
(abdomen) to deep black or dark brown, the
veins of the fore wings, head and terminalia being
invariably the darkest (Lauterer 1999). After over-
wintering, the adults migrate back to the host in
early March. In the Czech Republic, the first
adults of the new generation were collected at the
end of May (Lauterer 1999). The immatures of
C. affinis can cause small deformations of the
leaves as described by Ellis (2018). Females of C. affinis and C. melanoneura cannot
be reliably distinguished using morphological
characters (Lauterer 1999). Cacopsylla ambigua (Foerster, 1848)

Linnaeus, 1758 from the Netherlands with 2 am-
bigua as a synonym, based on a written notice of
G.A. Six in De Graaf et al. (1862). In the psyllid
literature these species names have never been
considered as synonyms. The identity of the
material of Van der Goot (1912) is thus considered
doubrful here. We provide the first confirmed
records of C. ambigua from the Netherlands. The Palaearctic C. ambigua (fig, 20) has been
found all over Europe (Jerinié-Prodanovié 2010,
Lauterer & Burckhardt 1997, Seljak 2006, Serbina
et al. 2015b). It lives on various willow species:
Salis: aurita, S. caprea, S. cinerea, S. elaeagnos,

S. lapponum and S. viminalis (Lauterer & Burck-
harde 1997). There are reports on second instar
immatures overwintering under the lateral buds
of the host plant. It seems more probable that
hibernation takes place in the egg stage. At some
central European localities, it is a univoltine
species but in Scandinavia it is bivoltine. In
Scandinavia adults were found from May until
‘August, in the Netherlands from April until
August, suggesting that C. ambigua is bivoltine in
the Netherlands (Hodkinson 2009, Lauterer 1999,

over Europe (Burckhardt 2013, Jerinié-Prodanovié
2010, Seljak 2006, Serbina et al. 2015b). Outside
Europe it has been recorded from Algeria, Morocco,
Georgia, Israel, Iran and India (Burckhardt 1989,
Burckhardt & Lauterer 1993, Ossiannilsson 1992). Is hose plants are Crataegus species: C. coccinea,
C. laevigata (= C. oxyacantha) and C. monogyna. The life cycle is univoltine, the adults overwinter
on conifers (Hodkinson 2009). Oviposition takes
place on young Crataegus leaves, especially on
the veins and stalks. The immatures move onto

 

young twigs later on (Ossiannilsson 1992). In the
Czech Republic, the first adults of the new gener-
ation were found in mid June. Adults often mi-
grate great distances and can be found on shelter
plants, such as Fagus and Salix (Ossiannilsson
1992, see also data on Dutch specimens above). Well-sclerotized adults are rusty brown. During
winter their colouration changes to deep black,
including the characteristic dark spots on the fore
wings (Lauterer 1999). After overwintering adults
return to their host for oviposition in late May
(Lauterer 1999). Cacopsylla fulguralis (Kuwayama, 1908)

Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, the Russian Far
East and the Philippines (Ouvrard 2018). It has
been introduced into Europe with its host plants
of the genus Elaeagnus which are planted as orna-
mental shrubs. The first record in Europe was
documented in 1999 from France (Cocquempot
& Germain 2000), followed by Belgium (Baugnée
2003), Great Britain, Italy, Spain (Mifsud et al. 2010), Switzerland (Burckhardt & Miihlethaler
2003) and Croatia (Burckhardt 2013). It was also
reported from the Netherlands by Baugnée (2003)
without providing any specific records. For this
reason, the Dutch records are listed here. Accord-
ing to the definition of Dutch Species Register
(2019) it is an alien species (status 2b). The host plants of C. fulguralis include Elaeagnus
glabra, E. macrophylla, E. cuprea and E. oldhamii. In Europe, it is primarily found on E. x ebbingei,
a hybrid between E, macrophylla and E. pungens
(Baugnée 2003, Cocquempot & Germain 2000). Deformations of the host by C. fidguralis are
illustrated by Ellis (2018). Probably there are more
than two generations per year, as indicated by

the observations of immatures from April until
October. The adults overwinter, as shown by the
observation of an adult on January 1 on the ever-
green host plant. In the Netherlands C. fulguralis is considered a

pest in greenhouse cultures of the host plant, but
also in public parks. Experiments are ongoing
with biological control of this psyllid with lace-
wings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), in the munici-
pality of Noordwijk (Zuid-Holland). For identification see Cocquempot & Germain
(2000). Cacopsylla hippophaes (Foerster, 1848)

The first Dutch report on C. hippophaes was by
Van der Goot (1912) and this species was also listed
by Blire (1926b). Cacopsylla hippophaes has a Palaearctic distribu-
tion, It occurs in western and central Europe
(Burckhardt 2013), Egypt, Turkey, the Caucasus
and Middle Asia (Ossiannilsson 1992, Ouvrard
2018). It is monophagous on Hippophae rham-
noides. Its sucking activities on the leaves result
in a limited distortion (Ellis 2018). The life cycle
is univoltine. In the Czech Republic oviposition
starts as late as the beginning of October and
continues until November (Lauterer 1982). The
eggs overwinter (Ossiannilsson 1992). In the Netherlands, H. rhamnoides grows on sea
dunes and at inland sites with supplemented
sea sand as industrial areas and rail road dikes

 

(Floron 2015). Cacopsylla hippophaes is quite
common in the sea dunes and occurs on almost
all places where its host plant grows. It has also
been collected in a few inland industrial areas
recently created by sea sand supplies. Adults were
found from May until September. Cacopsylla mali (Schmidberger, 1836)
Both Van der Goot (1912) and Blate (19266)
reported C. mali from the Netherlands. In the
Netherlands it is a common species with adults

collected from May until September. Cacopsylla mali is a Palaearctic species which

occurs all over Europe (Burckhardt 2013) and has
been introduced into Australia, Canada, usa and
South Africa (Burckharde 1994). It develops on
Malus species (Ossiannilsson 1992, Ouvrard 2018). The life cycle is univoltine with overwintering
eggs. The immatures hatch in spring and migrate
to the buds. The larger instars live on the flowers
and leaves. The adults emerge at the end of May,
during summer they disperse on various plant
species and return to the host plant for mating in
late summer. In summer the adults are green but
later they become ochreous to brown, In Germany,
adults were found from May until mid October,
oviposition starts at the beginning of September. One female produces about 100 eggs, laid singly
or in clusters from 2-10 on the bark or in crevices
near the buds (Burckhardt 1994). In the Netherlands C. mali is considered only a
minor pest in apple cultures. It reaches a pest
status only in unkept and, sometimes, organic
orchards (Van Frankenhuyzen & Gruys 1978). Young immatures live in buds where wax and
honeydew can cause slight damage to leaves. The
sucking activities of later instars result in sap loss,
damage to flowers leading to their destruction or
malformation of fruits, and sometimes also partial
defoliation. Honeydew serves as substrate for
mould. A reduced condition of the tree may re-
sult in a lower production next year (Burckhardt
1994). Cacopsylla melanoneura (Foerster, 1848)

After the first report of Van der Goot (1912) of

C. melanoneura also Blate (1926b) listed this
species from the Netherlands. It is common in
the country, with adults collected from April until
August. Cacopsylla melanoneura is widely distributed in
Europe (Burckhardt 2013) and has also been
found in Siberia, Mongolia, the Russian Far East,
Japan and China (Ossiannilsson 1992). It develops
on Crataegus species: C. monogyna, C. laevigata

 

 

NEDERLANDSE FAUNISTISCHE MEDEDELINGEN 53 — 2019

and C. maximowiczii and also on Malus species
and Pyrus communis (Ossiannilsson 1992). Cacops-
ylla melanoneura is a univoltine species overwin-
tering in the adult stage on conifers. Migration to
conifers begins as early as July (Burckhardt 1994,
Ossiannilsson 1992). As in many other Cacopsylla
species the body colour changes from rusty and
green to deep black during overwintering (Lauterer
1999, Burckhardt & Lauterer 2009a). The adults
return to the host as early as the end of February;
the oviposition commences in mid March (data
from the Czech Republic). Eggs are laid in the
buds and on young leaves. The first adults of

the new generation appear in mid May. Though
copulations sometimes occur in autumn, fertili-
zation takes place the next year (Lauterer 1999). Cacopsylla melanoneura is considered one of the
most important vectors of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
mali’, the phytoplasma associated with apple
proliferation disease, especially in Italy (Pizzinat
et al. 2011). It was also reported as a pest of
cultivated apple trees in Norway (Ossiannilsson
1992). Cacopsylla moscovita (Andrianova, 1948)

The first record of C. moscovita from the Nether-
lands was published by Lauterer & Malenovsky
(2002). This species is not common in the
Netherlands, being known altogether only from
three coastal localities and two inland spots. Adults occur from May until August. Cacopsylla moscovita occurs all over Europe except
the mediterranean area, and it is also present in
Turkey, the Caucasus, Siberia and the Russian Far
East (Burckharde 2013, Lauterer & Burckhardt
1997, Ossiannilsson 1992, Serbina et al. 2015b). Ic lives on a number of Salix species: S. aurita,

S. cinerea, S. caprea, S. lapponum, S. repens and

S. viminalis (Lauterer 1999, Ossiannilsson 1992). On three Dutch coastal localities it was collected

 

on S. repens, the usual host plant in England
(White & Hodkinson 1982). Cacopsylla moscovita

is a univoltine species, the adults overwinter,
perhaps in leaf litter (Hodkinson 2009). Cacopsylla parvipennis (Léw, 1878)

Blite (1926b) published the first finding of

C. parvipennis from the Netherlands and gave
seven localities, all at the Dutch sea coast. Blote
(1926c) indicated that it was a very common
species on Salix repens in the dune nature reserve
of Meijendel (near The Hague). From the current
perspective, C. parvipennis is uncommon and
only found in the Dutch coastal area with adults
collected from June until April. Cacopsylla parvipennis is distributed in northern
and central Europe Europe; it is missing from the
mediterranean area and the Balkans. Host plants
are Salix repens and S. rosmarinifolia (Lauterer &
Burckhardt 1997, Ossiannilsson 1992), the latter is
a non-indigenous plant in the Netherlands. Ie is a
univoltine species, the adults overwinter in the
leaf litter. Larvae are feeding on both sides of the
leaves of S. repens and also on the female catkins
(Lauterer 1965, Ossiannilsson 1992). Blate (1926c)
mentioned the yellow to green colour of the
adults in summer, later they become darker and
after overwintering they are almost black. Cacopsylla peregrina (Foerster, 1848)

Van der Goot (1912) included C. peregrina in his
lise of Dutch psyllids, but Blote (1926a,b) omitted
this species as he probably considered it a syno-
nym of C. mali, Gravestein (1944a,b) mentioned
C. peregrina as new for the Netherlands. He
studied Bléte’s material of C. mali and concluded
that most of it belonged to C. peregrina. In his
opinion C. peregrina was very common in the
Netherlands on its host, Crataegus. He noticed
different colour forms from May until October. We can confirm that it is a very common species
in the Netherlands on its host with adults collected
from April until October. DEN BIEMAN ET AL. ~

Cacopsylla peregrina is widely distributed in
Europe (Burckhardt 2013, Serbina et al. 2015b),
Northern Africa, Turkey, Japan and North America
(Ouvrard 2018). Crataegus oxyacantha, C. monogyna,
C. arnoldiana and C. maximowiczii were listed as
host plants (Ossiannilsson 1992). Like in C. mali,
the adults can be collected on a number of other
plants during summer, e.g, Corylus avellana,
Malus species, Populus tremula, Salix species,
Tascus baccata, Ulmus xhollandica and Quercus
robur (pers. obs. Kees den Bieman). In late August
and September, the adults return to Crataegus for
oviposition. At this time their colour changes
from green to rusty brown (Lauterer 1982). Caco-
psylla peregrina is a univoltine species which usually
overwinters in the egg stage (Conci et al. 1993,
Lauterer 1999, Ossiannilsson 1992). Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli, 1763)

Blate (1954) reported C. pruni for the first time
from the Netherlands. It is quite common in the
Netherlands, mainly collected on Prunus spinosa. Adults were collected from March until July. Cacopsylla pruni is found all over Europe and
also in Turkey, the Caucasus, Iran and Siberia
(Burckharde 2013, Burckhardt & Lauterer 1993,
Ossiannilsson 1992, Ouvrard 2018). Ie develops on
several Prunus species including cultivated fruit
trees (Ouvrard 2018), being usually the most
common on P spinosa at sunny and warm local-
ities (Lauterer 1999). It is univoltine, overwintering
as adult on conifers. Spring migration to the host
starts in the beginning of April, followed by
copulation and oviposition. The eggs are laid on
both sides of the leaves and on the leaf stalks. Young immatures develop there and beneath the
bud scales. The new generation emerges from
June onwards. Shortly after emergence the adults
start to migrate to their shelter plants (Lauterer
1999, Ossiannilsson 1992). Adults and immatures of C. pruni are vectors of
*Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum, the causal

agent of the European stone fruit yellows disease. Apricot Prunus armeniaca, Japanese plum Prunus
salicina and peach Prunus persica are seriously
affected by the disease while Prunus domestica is
tolerant. This phytoplasma was found in most
European countries and causes substantial impact
especially in central and southern Europe (Carraro
et al. 1998, Steffek et al. 2012). Perhaps C. pruni is a complex of two cryptic
species (Peccoud et al. 2013). Cacopsylla pulchra (Zetterstedt, 1838)

and also in the Causasus, Russian Far East and
Japan (Burckhardt 2013, Jerinié-Prodanovié 2010,
Ossiannilsson 1992, Seljak 2006, Serbina et al. 2o15b). Ie lives on a number of Salix species:

S. caprea, S. cinerea, S. myrsinifolia, S. pentandra,
S. purpurea, S. repens, S. viminalis and S, triandra
x viminalis, along streams and around ponds, in
forest clearings and on shrubs scattered in wet
meadows (Lauterer & Burckhardt 1997, Malenovsky
et al. 2011). It is univoltine, the adults overwinter
mainly on conifers and other evergreen plants,
such as Vaccinium myrtillus, In the Netherlands
and also in Scandinavia adults were collected
throughout the year (Ossiannilsson 1992, pers. obs. Kees den Bieman). In the Czech Republic
copulations were observed at the end of March
(Lauterer 1999). Cacopsylla pyri (Linnaeus, 1761)

De Graaf et al. (1862) and Van der Goot (1912)
mentioned C. pyri in their lists of Dutch psyllids,
while Blite (1926b) omitted it, Ie is a rather
common species in the Netherlands where adults
were collected from July until October. Cacopsylla pyri is a seasonally dimorphic species. The fore wings of the summer generations are
transparent, while in overwintering generations
there are conspicuous black shadows in the cells. The genal cones of the summer generation are
usually pale, overwintering specimens have the
whole cones or at least their tips black or brown. It is a Palacarctic species which occurs all over
Europe, the Caucasus, Iran, Middle Asia and
China (Burckhardt 2013, Burckhardt & Lauterer
1993, Cho et al. 2017, Ossiannilsson 1992, Serbina
et al. 2015b). The host plants of C. pyri are Pyrus
communis and P elaeagrifolia. It is a bivoltine
species in Scandinavia, multivoltine in countries
with a warmer climate. In France there are 4-8
generations per year. The adults overwinter in
bark crevices on pear trees. In southern and eastern
Europe also the eggs overwinter (Lauterer 1999). Egg clusters are laid on young shoots, later on the
underside of the leaves (Burckharde 1993, Ossian-
nilsson 1992). In the Netherlands the earliest
observations of matings are from January and
oviposition starts as early as February. Fifth instar
immatures were observed as late as December and
on sunny December days the adults appear (Van
Frankenhuijzen & Freriks 1972). There are four
generations per year in the Netherlands of which
the second generation causes the most problems
in pear orchards (car 2003). Considerable dam-
age can be caused by immatures feeding on flower
stalks and leaves (Ossiannilsson 1992). The species
is also a vector of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’,
the causal agent of the pear decline disease
(Scemiiller et al. 2011) and of ‘Candidatus Liberib-
acter europaeus’. The latter bacterium does not
cause symptoms in pears and is probably a sym-
biont of the psyllid rather than a pathogen
(Camerota et al. 2012, Cho et al. 2017b). Cacopsylla pyricola (Foerster, 1848)

Blite (1926b) mentioned C. pyricola for the first
time from the Netherlands. Gravestein (1944a,b)
reported Prylla simulans Foerster, 1848 as a new
species for the fauna of the Netherlands; however,
this is a synonym for C. pyricola. Cacopsylla pyri-
cola is uncommon in the Netherlands; adults were
collected from February until August. Cacopsylla pyricola is seasonally dimorphic: the
summer form is light orange to reddish brown
with darker markings and largely pale genal
cones. The winter form is darker and also the
genal cones are dark (see Ossiannilsson (1992) for
more details). Cacopsylla pyricola occurs throughout Europe and
it has been introduced into Canada and usa
(Burckhardt 2013, Ouvrard 2018). The reports of
C. pyricola from South America, Japan, Korea and
China proved to be other Cacopsylla species (Cho
et al. 2017b, Valle et al. 2017). DEN BIEMAN ET AL. ~

Cacopsylla pyricola lives on Pyrus communis and

P pyraster. It is polyvoltine, with two generations
in Scandinavia and four to five in France. The
adults overwinter on the host and in leaf litter. In
early spring, eggs are laid in clusters on the buds,
the underside of the leaves and on leaf stalks. A
female may lay over 400 eggs. The immature
development takes about 35-40 days. Serious
damage is caused by injection of salivary phyto-
toxins, transmission of pathogens (‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma pyri’) causing pear decline and
removal of large quantities of plant nutrients
resulting in premature leaf drop, reduced terminal
and trunk growth, reduced fruit size and poor
fruit set in the following year. The secretion of
honeydew by immatures creates an ideal medium
for the growth of sooty mould on leaves and
fruits (Burckharde 1994, caBi 2017, Lauterer 1999,
Ossiannilsson 1992). Also C. pyricola bears the
bacterium ‘Candidatus Liberibacter europacus’
(see the remark on C. pyri). Cacopsylla pyrisuga (Foerster, 1848)

countries from which C. pyrisuga (fig. 23) had not
been reported yet (Burckhardt 2013, Serbina et al. 2015b). Outside Europe it is also known from

the Caucasus, Iran, Israel, Lebanon and Turkey
(Burckharde & Lauterer 1993, Burckhardt &
Onucar 1993, Cho et al. 2017b, Ouvrard 2018,
Spodek et al. 2017). The published records of

C. pyrisuga from Japan, Korea and China proved
to be Cacopsylla burckhardti Luo et al., 2012 (Cho
et al. 2017b). Cacopsylla pyrisuga lives on Pyrus species: P. com-
munis, P amygdaliformis, P pashia and P salicifolia

(Cho et al. 20176), It is a univoltine species with
overwintering adults, mainly on conifers. The
adults return to the host plant from mid March
to April. The eggs are deposited when the leaf
buds are opening, mainly on the median veins
and stalks on young leaves. Mature leaves and
woody parts of twigs are avoided. A female may
produce up to 1000 eggs which are deposited in
small clutches of 2-6. The eggs produce deforma-
tions of leaf buds. The young immatures may
cause conspicuous leaf-roll deformations. Later
they migrate from the leaves to the woody twigs
where they often crowd together in dense aggre-
gations, producing honeydew which attracts ants. Later, the immatures return to the leaves where
the last moult takes place. The adults of the new
generation appear in early June. Shortly after
sclerotization the adults migrate to their shelter
plants (Burckhardt 1994, Lauterer 1999,
nilsson 1992). Cacopsylla pyrisuga is vector of ‘Candidatus Phyto-
plasma pyri’, causing the pear decline disease, and
the bacterium ‘Candidatus Liberibacter europacus
(Cho et al. 2017b). However, the economic im-
pact of C. pyrisuga in the Netherlands is limited
due to its rarity. Cacopsylla rhamnicola (Scott, 1876)

Cacopsylla rhamnicola (fig. 24) is monophagous
on Rhamnus, mainly R. cathartica but in Slovenia
also on R. fallax (Seljak 2006) and in Italy also on
R, saxatilis and R. alpinus (Conci et al. 1993). Ie
often occurs in relatively warm habitats such as
sun-exposed shrubs scattered in dry grassland,
meadows or fens, along forest margins and in
open forests (Malenovsky et al. 201). Ie is univol-
tine, the adults overwinter mainly on conifers,
mainly Abies alba, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies. During overwintering, the body colouration
changes from ochreous with a green abdomen to
deep black-brown, with minute paler spots on the
head and with longitudinal stripes on the thorax. The wing venation turns to black but the wing
membrane remains transparent (Lauterer 1999). Eggs are deposited in the inflorescences and on
the young folded leaves of Rhamnus at the begin-
ning of June, the fifth instars were found as late
as in August. The first adults were observed at the
end of June. The migration to the overwintering
plants seems to start early as shown by a young
female on July 11 on Pinus sylvestris (Lauterer
1999, Ossiannilsson 1992). Cacopsylla saliceti (Foerster, 1848)

Both Van der Goot (1912, as Pylla salicola Foerster,
1848) and Blate (1926b) reported C. saliceti from

the Netherlands. This speci
over the Netherlands but is not common and

is distributed all

occurs only locally. Adults were collected from
February until November. Cacopsylla saliceti has a Palacarctic distribution
and occurs all over Europe with the exception of
Scandinavia and the greater part of the Balkans. Icis also present in Turkey, the Caucasus and the
Russian Far East (Lauterer & Burckhardt 1997). The host plants include several species of Salix:
Salix alba, S. aurita, S. cinerea, S. elaeagnos,

S. fiagrans, S. fragilis and S. purpurea (Lauterer &
Burckhardt 1997), growing in various habitats,
e.g, banks of small streams, shores of ponds or
roadside verges (Malenovsky et al. 2011). Cacopsylla

 

saliceti is a univoltine species. The adults over-
winter on conifers and in leaf litter (Hodkinson
2009). In the Czech Republic overwintering
adults were found until the beginning of June. Oviposition starts in April. The first specimens
of the new generation were found as early as mid
May (Lauterer 1999). For identification see Lauterer & Burckhardt
(1997). This species shows a remarkable variation
in the shape of the parameres. Cacopsylla sorbi (Linnaeus, 1758)

stands of Sorbus aucuparia it has not been found. Ic has a Palacarctic distribution and has been
recorded all over Europe with the exception of
the Iberian Peninsula (Burckhardt 2013, Jerinié-
Prodanovié 2010, Seljak 2006, Serbina et al. 2o15b). It has also been introduced into North
America (Ossiannilsson 1992). Cacopsylla sorbi is closely related and morphologi-
cally similar to C. mali. Besides Sorbus aucuparia,
it also develops on S. amurensis. Even in cases of
heavy infestation of the host plant in the Czech
Republic no damage has been observed, such as
contamination with honeydew or deformation of
leaves and sprouts. The reason for this may be
that the species attacks the host plane at a later
physiological stage, when the leaves and inflores-
cences are larger, compared to the case of C. mali
and its host plant. Copulations were observed
from late June onwards. Oviposition starts in

migrations to other plants as C. mali and C. pere-
grina. This might be related to the early ripening
of the ovaries. The life cycle is univoltine with
overwintering in the egg stage (Lauterer 1999,

Despite intensive collection activities, this species
was not found at many stands of Ulmus laevis and
U. glabra in the provinces of Noord-Brabant and
Zecland and generally it appears uncommon in
the Netherlands. Cacopsylla ulmi (fig. 26) has a
Palacarctic distribution. In Europe, it has been
recorded from many countries with the exception
of the Iberian Peninsula. From neighbouring
Belgium, it has not yet been reported (Baugnée et
al, 2012 Burckhardt 2013, Jerinié-Prodanovié 2010,
Ripka 2008, Seljak 2006, Serbina et al. 2015b). It
is also present in the Caucasus and in Kazakhstan
(Ossiannilsson 1992). Host plants are Ulmus trees: U. laevis, U. glabra
and U, minor (Ossiannilsson 1992, Ripka 2008). ‘The life cycle is univoltine, the eggs overwinter. In Scandinavia adults were collected between June
and September (Ossiannilsson 1992) and in the
Czech Republic from May until November
(Lauterer 1999). Copulations were observed as
early as June, however oviposition starts much
later, from mid-September onwards. Eggs are laid
mostly singly on sprouts and around buds, mainly
on the lower branches of older trees. In spite of
heavy infestations, no deformation of leaves,
stalks or stems were observed in the Czech

Republic. The immatures hatch at the time of
budding of elm trees, phenologically much later
than in the closely related C. mali on apple trees
and C. peregrina on hawthorn bushes. Cacopsylla visci (Curtis, 1835)

Cobben (1951) collected C. visci (reported as Pyylla
viscicola Haupt, 1935) for the first time in the
Netherlands, see also Gravestein (1951). Adults
have been collected in the Netherlands from June
to August. Cacopsylla visci has a Palaearctic distri-
bution and has been recorded from a number
of European countries, North Africa, as well as
eastern Asia including Japan and Korea (Burck-
harde 2013, Burckhardr et al. 2017, Cho et al. 2017a, Hansen & Hodkinson 2006, Ripka 2008,
Seljak 2006, Seruwe et al. 2009). The host plants of C. visci are Viscum album and
Loranthus europaeus (Burckhardt et al. 2017). Both
plants have a hemiparasitic life style on various
trees and shrubs. Cacopsylla visci has 2-3 genera-
tions a year and overwinters in the egg stage
(Hodkinson 2009), although based on data from
Norway, it was suggested that it overwinters as
fourth and fifth instars (Hansen & Hodkinson
2006, Lauterer 1999). In the Netherlands V, album only occurs in the
utmost southern part of the province of Limburg. However, V, album is also sometimes cultivated in
botanical gardens and C. visci can also be found
there. In several gardens the cultivation started
from seeds and the occurrence of C. visei at these
places show that C. visci can be dispersed by wind
to far distant places. Cacopsylla zetterstedti (Thomson, 1877)

Lauterer & Malenovsky (2002) reported C. zetter-
stedti for the first time from the Netherlands in
the province of Zuid-Holland, 2 km Ne Scheve-
ningen, 7.v11.2002, 8 3, 6 2, on Hippophae

rhamnoides, This species is common in the Dutch
sea dunes. Cacopsylla zetterstedti is widely distributed in
the western Palacarctic region, being recorded
throughout Europe and also Turkey, the Caucasus
and the Altai in Russia (Burckhardt 2013, Burck-
hardt & Onucar 1993, Labina 2008, Ossiannilsson
1992). Cacopsylla zetterstedti is closely related to

C. hippophaes, has the same life cycle (univoltine,
with overwintering eggs) and shares the same host
plant (Hippophae rhamnoides). However, in the
Netherlands and also in the Czech Republic

C. zetterstedti is much less common than C. hippo-
phaes (Lauterer 1982, Lauterer & Malenovsky
2002, pers. obs. Kees den Bieman). Both species
occur together in the Dutch sea dunes and at
inland localities as described for C. hippophaes. Chamaepsylla hartigii (Flor, 1861)

The first Dutch report on C. hartigii was by Bléte
(1926b). From the current perspective, it is a
common species in the Netherlands. Adults were
collected from May until August. Chamaepsylla hartigii is a Holarctic species occur-
ring all over Europe with the exception of most
Balkan countries. It also occurs in the Caucasus,
the Russian Far East, Japan and North America
(Burckhardt 2013, Ossiannilsson 1992, Ouvrard
2018). It lives on various Betula species (Ouvrard
2008). Betula pendula is the most common host
plane in the Netherlands. The life cycle of C. har-
tigii is probably univoltine with overwintering
eggs (Hodkinson 2009, Lauterer 1998, Ossian-
nilsson 1992). Adults in Scandinavia and the
Czech Republic appear from May until August
or the beginning of September (Ossiannilsson
1992, Lauterer 1998), just as in the Netherlands. Livilla variegata (Léw, 1881)
New for the Netherlands

Gelderland Wageningen, Klein Arboretum, ac
175,0-442,1, 31.VU1.2015, 2 3, on Laburnum anagy-
roides, idem, 23.11.2016, 2 @, on L. anagyroides. Livilla variegata (fig, 27) is considered native to
southern or southwestern Europe and the Alps
but it has expanded its range to the north, to
urban areas since the 1970s (Burckhardt & Miihle-
thaler 2003). Currently it is widespread in western
and central Europe: Austria, Bosnia and Herze-
govina, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great
Britain, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland (Burckhardt 2013,
Hodkinson & Hollis 1987, Lauterer & Malenovsky
2002, Malenovsky & Kment 2004, Seljak 2006). Ichas also been introduced into Canada (Wheeler
& Hoebeke 2017). For the Netherlands it is an
alien species (status 2c, Dutch Species Register
2019). Icis strictly oligophagous on Laburnum anagyroides
and L. alpinum. Laburnum anagyroides is a mediter-
ranean tree often planted as an ornamental plant
in parks and gardens (Hodkinson & Hollis 1987). Damage to host plants has not yet been reported
(Malenovsky & Kment 2004). In Italy, it has one
generation per year, adults occur from April to
‘August, immatures were collected in April and
May. Probably the eggs or the first instars over-
winter (Conci et al. 1993). For identification see Hodkinson & Hollis (1987). Prylla alni (Linnaeus, 1758)

De Graaf et al. (1862) mentioned P alni from the
Netherlands and also Van der Goot (1912) and
Bléte (1926b) listed this species. It is currently
very common in the Netherlands with adults col-
lected from May until the beginning of October. Pylla alni occurs all over Europe and also in the
East Palacactic region and North America (Burck-
harde 2013, Ossiannilsson 1992). DEN BIEMAN ET AL. ~ CHECKLIST OF THE DUTCH JUMPING PLANT LICE

 

‘The life history of P alni was studied by De Geer
(1773); Lauterer (1998) gave an extensive descrip-
tion. The host plants are alder species: Alnus
glutinosa, A. incana and A. viridis in Europe and
A. japonica and A. hirsuta in Japan. The life cycle
is univoltine. In late autumn the female deposits
groups of 4-5 eggs on the host plant buds. The
eggs overwinter (Ossiannilsson 1992, Lauterer
1998, Hodkinson 2009). Hatching starts at the
time of bud break, in late March and the begin-
ning of April. Immatures are coated in white
flocculent wax and stay on the young shoots in
the axis of leaves (Ossiannilsson 1992). Young
instars are sedentary, the last two instars often
move on the host plant. In Central Europe the
first adults were observed in May (Lauterer 1998)
as in the Netherlands. Prylla buxi (Linnaeus, 1758)

Van der Goot (1912) was the first to mention

P. busi from the Netherlands, Blate (1926b) also
listed ie. This species can be found in almost every
Durch garden with its host Buxus sempervirens. This is a non-indigenous plant in the Netherlands
(alien species status 2a, Dutch Species Register
2019). Adults were collected between June and the
beginning of October. Pyylla buxi was the subject
of one of the few Dutch studies on the biology of
a psyllid (Wilcke 1942). Prylla buxi is perhaps native to western and
southern Europe and it has been introduced into
central and northern Europe a long time ago and,
probably more recently, also to North America
and the Pacific (Malenovsky & Lauterer 2011). Ic is narrowly oligophagous on Buxus species,
mainly found on Buus sempervirens, but also

on B. microphylla and B. balearica (Hodkinson
& White 1979, Wilcke 1941). It is a univoltine
species. From mid July until the end of August
eggs are laid in the terminal buds of the host
plant. Eggs hatch from mid August to the end
of October. Remarkably, the first instar remains
in the open egg shell until the next moult in the

following year. Hodkinson (2009) suggested that
eggs overwinter but perhaps he did not consider
that the first instars remain in the egg shell. The
second instar appears at the beginning of April,

it leaves the egg shell and crawls to just opening
buds. The development of the immatures takes a
long time and three or four different instars can
occur simultaneously. The immatures are covered
with wax. The development of immatures is com-
pleted before mid June (Conci et al. 1993, Wilcke
1941). In spring and early summer, the immatures
produce leaf galls, each leaf being transformed
into a bowl-like formation (Docters van Leeuwen
& Alta 1946, Docters van Leeuwen 2009, Gross-
curt 2017, Ossiannilsson 1992, Wilcke 1941). Palla buxi is a minor pest for commercial box
cultivation. Regular pruning is advised as precau-
tionary measure (Groenkennisnet 2017). Spanioneura fonscolombii Foerster, 1848

collected for the first time in 2009 by A. Sonne-
mans. In a few years it has dispersed all over the
Netherlands, on its host plant in gardens but also
into almost every commercial Buxus nursery. On

its host plant it often occurs together with P buxi. Sampling in the Netherlands for 2. buxi before
2009 has never resulted in the discovery of S. fon-
scolombii suggesting that S. fonscolombii is a re-
cently introduced species (alien species, status 2c,
Dutch Species Register). Spanioneura fonscolombii originally had a limited

 

distribution in southern and western Europe:
Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy, Ireland,
Luxembourg, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland
(Burckhardt 2013, O'Connor & Malumphy 2011,
Seljak 2006) but it has recently also reached as
far north as the southern provinces of Sweden
(Gertsson 2015). It has also been introduced

to Connecticut and Massachusetts in the usa
(Hodkinson 1988, Conci et al. 1993). Spanioneura fonscolombii is monophagous on box
Buxus sempervirens, with a single generation per
year. The adults overwinter on the host plant. Hodkinson (2009) suggested that there might

be more than one generation per year and that
pethaps also the eggs overwinter. As the Dutch
data show, adults can be collected throughout the
year. The species is sometimes abundant, without
reaching a pest status in box cultures (Conci et al. 1993). For identification see Hodkinson & White (1979). Triozidae

tion of most mediterranean countries (Burckhardt

Alchemilla xanthochlora (Burckhardt & Lauterer
1997b). Both plants belong to Rosaceae but usually
grow in different habitats. Bactericera acutipennis is a bivoltine species with
a strong seasonal dimorphism between the two
generations in colouration and distribution of the
surface spinules on the fore wings, which is in-
duced by differences in photoperiod (Burckhardt
& Lauterer 1997b, Lauterer 1982, Ossiannilsson
1992). The adults overwinter, usually on conifers
(Hodkinson 2009, Ossiannilsson 1992). Bactericera albiventris (Foerster, 1848)

After the first report of B. albiventris from the
Netherlands by Van der Goot (1912) also Bléte
(1926b) listed this species. It is quite common in
the Netherlands with adults collected throughout
the year. Bactericera albiventris is a widely distributed
Palacarctic species found in most European coun-
tries (Burckhardt 2013, Ripka 2008, Seljak 2006),
as well as eastern Asia (Burckhardt & Lauterer
1997b, Ossiannilsson 1992). ‘A number of Salix species are known hosts: Salix
alba, S. caprea, S. gracilis, S. lapponum, S. myrsini-
{folia, S. rosmarinifolia, S. triandra, S. pentandra,
S. purpurea and S, repens (Burckhardt & Lauterer

from most European countries with the exception
of the Iberian Peninsula. This Palaearctic species
reaches eastern Siberia and Japan (Burckharde
2013, Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997b, Jerinié-
Prodanovié 2010, Konovalova 1988, O*Connor &
Malumphy 2011, Seljak 2006, Serbina et al. 2o15b). It is one of the many Salix-feeding Bacte-
ricera species, reported from Salix alba, S. aurita,
S. caprea, S. cinerea, S. purpurea, S. repens and

S. viminalis (Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997). In
Scandinavia immatures were observed from July
until October on both sides of willow leaves. Adults were found throughout the year (Ossian-
nilsson 1992). Probably it has only one generation
per year and the adults overwinter on conifers
(Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997b, Hodkinson 2009). Bactericera maura (Foerster, 1848)

no collecting record was given. Bléte (1926b) and
Burckharde (2013) omitted this species. Labina et
al. (2014) cited B. maura from the Netherlands
without providing a reference or collecting data. For this reason, the available collection data are
given here. NEDERLANDSE FAUNISTISCHE MEDEDELINGEN 53 — 2019

Bactericera maura has been reported in Europe
from Austria, Czech Republic, France, Germany,
Poland, Romania, Russia (European part), Slovakia,
Spain, Switzerland and Ukraine, and outside
Europe also from the Caucasus, Kazakhstan and
the Russian Far East; published records from the
usa proved to be B. salicivora (Burckhardt 2013,
Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997b, Hodkinson 1981,
Konovalova 1988). Bactericera maura occurs on Salix species: Salix
alba, S. fragilis, S. triandra and S. purpurea
(Dobreanu & Manolache 1961). It is often found
on S. purpurea along streams and around springs
and ponds (Malenovsky & Lauterer 2012). It is a
bivoltine species (Lauterer 1993b). The samples
from early March (from Zaandam) confirm that
B, maura overwinters as adult. For identification see Burckharde & Lauterer
(1997b) and Dobreanu & Manolache (1961). Bactericera nigricornis (Foerster, 1848)

Bléte (1926a,b,c) reported the first observations of
B. nigricornis from the Netherlands. It is probably
an uncommon species. The most recent data
from the Netherlands date back to 1955. Bactericera nigricornis occurs all over Europe
(with the exception of Great Britain and Ireland),
North Africa, Central Asia and the East Palacactic
region including the Russian Far East (Burckharde
2013, Burckharde & Lauterer 1997b, Ossiannilsson
1992, Ouvrard 2018). In contrast to the overwhelming majority of the
European psyllids B. nigricornis is a polyphagous
species (Hodkinson 1981, 2009) feeding on a
variety of herbaceous dicotyledonous plants,
including cultivated crops: carrot Daucus carota,
parsley Petroselinum crispum (Apiaceae), Datura
stramonium, potato Solanum tuberosum, S. nigrum,
Convolvulus arvensis (Solanaceae), beet Beta
vulgaris, Chenopodium album (Amaranthaceae),

Brassica rapa, B. campestris, Erysimum cheiran-
thoides, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Thlaspi arvense,
Raphanus raphanistrum (Brassicaceae) (Burckhardt
& Lauterer 1997b, Hodkinson 1981). The life
cycle is univoltine in Scandinavia but multivoltine
in other areas (Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997b,
Ossiannilsson 1992). Adults overwinter on conifers
and other plants (Lauterer 1991, Ossiannilsson
1992). Adults and immatures were found simulta-
neously on the host plant in the Netherlands, up
until December (Gravestein 1949). In the Nether-
lands B. nigricornis was found on Brassica rapa

f rapifera and has at least three generations a year
(Gravestein 1949). Bactericera reuteri (Sulc, 1913)
New for the Netherlands

Limburg Heel, Ossen nature reserve, ac 192,6-
354s15 27.V1.2003, 1 @, det. D. Burckhardt. Bactericera reuteri (fig. 30) is distributed mainly in
central and northern Europe. Outside Europe it
has also been recorded from the Altai Mts. and
Mongolia (Burckhardt 2013, Burckharde & Lauterer
1997b, Labina 2008, Ossiannilsson 1992, Serbina
et al. 2015b). The record from the Netherlands is
probably the westernmost in Europe. Bactericera reuteri develops on Potentilla (= Argen-
tina) anserina, with immatures staying on the
underside of the leaves. In the Czech Republic

it often occurs in salt marshes. It is a bivoltine
species, the adults overwinter, The body of adults
of the summer generation is orange brown with
extensive dark brown markings on head, thorax
and abdomen, while specimens of the overwintering
generation are almost uniformly dark brown to
black (Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997b, Lauterer
1993b, Ossiannilsson 1992, Seljak et al. 2008). The fifth instar immatures of Bactericera species
associated with Rosaceae including B. reuteri can
be identified using the key by Seljak & Male-
novsky (2014). DEN BIEMAN ET AL. ~

ciently known. At the moment records are available
from the following European regions: Belgium,
France, Great Britain, and perhaps also from
former Czechoslovakia, Greece and Sicily (Baugnée
et al. 2002, Bolzern & Burckhardt 2004, Burck-
harde 2005b). It also occurs in Algeria (Burck-
harde & Lauterer 1997b). This species was raised
from subspecies to species level relatively recently. Icis closely related to B. curvatinervis and shares
the same host plants: Salix species, especially Salix
caprea and S. cinerea (Burckhardt & Lauterer
1997b, Hodkinson 1974b). Its life cycle has not
been extensively studied. The adults overwinter
on conifers (Burckhardt 2005b). For identification of adults, see Burckharde &

So far, B. substriola (fig. 32) has been recorded
only from the following European countries:
Austria, Belarus, Czech Republic, Germany, Great
Britain, Sweden and Switzerland (Burckhardt
2013, Malenovsky & Lauterer 2012, Serbina et al. 2or5b). It is a member of a taxonomically difficult
group of Salix-feeding species (Burckhardt &
Lauterer 1997). Its biology is poorly known. Ossiannilsson (1992) described it from Salix
Lapponum, Burckhardt & Lauterer (1997b) also
mentioned S. elaeagnos as a hostplant. However,
none of these Salix species occur in the Nether-
lands (Floron 2015). In the Czech Republic

B. substriola probably develops on additional
Salis: species (Malenovsky & Lauterer 2012). Its
life cycle is not fully known. In Sweden adules
were collected in June and July (Ossiannilsson
1992), in the Czech Republic in June and Sep-
tember (Malenovsky & Lauterer 2012) and in the
Netherlands in September. Heterotrioza chenopodii (Reuter, 1876)

Based on a single record from Noord-Holland
(Zeeburg, Amsterdam), Van der Goot (1912) and
Blate (1926b) reported H. chenopodii from the
Netherlands for the first time, Currently, it is a
rather common species in the Zeeland delta,
mostly found on Arriplex littoralis and A. prostrata
growing at the foot of sea dikes in a salty environ-
ment. Heterotrioza chenopodii has also been found
in similar habitats in the north of the Netherlands
in the Waddensea area (col. R. van Klink). Adults
were collected from June until September. Heterotrioza chenopodit is a Palaearctic species
widely distributed throughout Europe, North
Africa, the Middle East and temperate Asia. It has
been introduced into North and South America
(Burckhardt 2013, Malenovsky & Lauterer 2012,
Ossiannilsson 1992, Ouvrard 2018). Ie lives on a
number of Amaranthaceae taxa: Atriplex species,
Beta vulgaris, Chenopodium species, Spinacia
oleracea and perhaps also Halimione portulacoides
(Aguiar & Martin 1999, Hodkinson & White
1979, Ossiannilsson 1992, Spodek et al. 2017). In
the Netherlands it is a typical species of the sea
coast, while inland (e.g. in the Czech Republic) it
is mainly collected at ruderal localities (Lauterer
1982). However, in the latter type of habitat

H. chenopodii has never been observed in the
Netherlands. NEDERLANDSE FAUNISTISCHE MEDEDELINGEN 53 — 2019

‘The number of generations varies regionally. In
northwestern Europe there are probably two
generations per year, the adults overwinter on the
shoots of the host plant. Adults have never been
observed on conifers (Hodkinson 2009, Ossian-
nilsson 1992). Heterotrioza chenopodii shows a
pronounced seasonal dimorphism between the
summer (long-day) and overwintering (short-day)
generations which differ in colouration as well

as wing length and shape (Lauterer 1982, Ossian-
nilsson 1992). Lauritrioza alacris (Flor, 1861)

Van der Goot (1912) and Bléte (1926b) reported
L. alacris from the Netherlands. Burckhardt
(2013) mentioned it as doubtfully present there. ‘We can confirm that it is a rather common
species on ornamental laurel in the Netherlands
(alien species, status 2b, Dutch Species Register
2019). Adults were collected from June until
September. Lauritrioza alacris is native to the mediterranean
region, the Caucasus and Crimea. It has been
introduced into many countries of central and
northern Europe as well as North and South
America (Burckhardt 2013, Burckhardt & Miihle-
thaler 2003, Burckhardt & Queiroz 2012, Ouvrard
2018). Ic is narrowly oligophagous on Laurus nobilis
and L. azoricus (Ossiannilsson 1992). Reports of
Prunus laurocerasus as a host plant are erroneous
and probably based on the confusion of the
French and Italian names for these two plants
(Conei & Tamanini 1985; in Dutch, the plant
names are similarly confusin,
and laurierkers for P laurocerasus). laurier for L. nobilis

 

On L. nobilis, L. alacris induces leaf galls (Docters
van Leeuwen & Alta 1946, Docters van Leeuwen
1957, 1982, 2009). These galls and also the eggs
and immatures were beautifully illustrated by Ellis
(2018) and Grosscurt (2017). The life history of

L. alacris was summarized by Conci & Tamanini
(1985). The female oviposits near and along the
margin of the lower surface of young leaves. The
female stays close to the eggs first and inserts its
rostrum repeatedly in the leaf. On the following
day a characteristic leaf winding becomes apparent,
and remains for about a week as a thin roll, after
which it increases rapidly to the characteristic gall
form. One gall normally contains immatures of
various instars, exuviae and wax threads, all in
sticky honeydew. The mature fifth instars leave
the gall, the fifth instar is also covered with abun-
dant white wax secretions. The number of genera-
tions is variable according to climatic factors:
from one or two generations in England (Hod-
kinson & White 1979) up to five generations per
year in Italy. The adults overwinter on the host
plant (Conci & Tamanini 1985). In England and
Italy adults are found throughout the year (Conci
& Tamanini 1985, Hodkinson & White 1979). Laurus nobilis is a non-indigenous plant in the
Netherlands and L. alacris was undoubtedly in-
troduced to the country due to the trade with
ornamental plants. However, in the garden of the
first author two larger laurel plants were growing
and in the first seven years no psyllid or gall was
observed. Later L. alacris was found, suggesting
that it can actively disperse by flying and success-
fully find its host plane. ‘The aesthetic damage on ornamental laurel can
be so high that gardeners sometimes use chemical
treatment (Conci et al. 1993). Trichochermes walkeri (Foerster, 1848)

few reports of Waarneming.nl are based on the
observation of the galls. At this moment only one
adult has been examined by us from the Nether-
lands. Trichochermes walker’ is easily recognizable
due to the colour of the forewing and other
characters. It occurs throughout Europe with the
exception of the major part of the Balkan area
(Burckharde 2013, Ouvrard et al. 2015). In
western, northern and central Europe it is
monophagous on Rhamnus cathartica, on which
it induces a leaf-margin rolling gall (Docters van
Lecuwen & Alta 1946, Ellis 2018, Grosscurt 2017). ‘These galls are initiated in spring by the feeding
of the immatures. Other published host plants,
such as Frangula alnus (Hodkinson & White
1979), need confirmation. Trichochermes walkeri is a univoltine species. Oviposition starts mid October and continues
until November. The eggs are laid under the bark
of young twigs. The first eggs harch in May and
the first adults occur in July in the Czech Republic
(Lauterer 1982), In England adults were found
from June to October (Hodkinson & White
1979), in Scandinavia from July until September
(Ossiannilsson 1992). The eggs overwinter, which
is uncommon in European Triozidae (Conci et al. 1993, Ossiannilsson 1992). Trioza apicalis Foerster, 1848

only based on galls, adults have not yet been
collected. As there is another psyllid species asso-
ciated with A. sylvestris in Europe, Trioza anthrisci
Burckhardt, 1986, the presence of 7; apicalis in
the Netherlands still needs to be confirmed by

a detailed examination of a sample including
immatures and/or adults. However, Burckhardt
(1986) stated that Z. anthrisci does not induce any
deformation and discoloration of its host plant. Trioza apicalis is an Eurosiberian species which
occurs in most of Europe (with the exception of
the Iberian Peninsula and Belgium) (Burckhardt
2013, Ossiannilsson 1992, Ripka 2008, Seljak
2006, Serbina et al. 201sb) and also in Daghestan,
Mongolia and the Russian Far East (Ossiannilsson
1992). Laska (2011) summarized the biology of 7: apicalis. Ic lives on a number of Apiaceae species, e.g. Aethusa cynapium, Anthriscus cerefolium, A. sylvestris,
Carum carvi, Coriandrum sativum, Daucus carota,
Foeniculum vulgare, Heraclewm latifolium, Pastinaca
sativa, Petroselinum crispum, Pimpinella saxifiaga
and P anism (Hodkinson & White 1979, Laska
2011, Ossiannilsson 1992). Daucus carota is the
preferred host (Burckharde 1986). It is a univoltine
species, the adults overwinter on conifers. Post
overwintering migration results in infestation of
carrot fields from May onwards. A short summer
migration is possible. Feeding of the immatures
and adults on leaves and leaf stalks of carrots
causes severe curling of the leaves and also results
in their discoloration (Ellis 2018, Laska 2011,
Ossiannilsson 1992). Trioza apicalis is a serious pest of carrots in northern
and occasionally central Europe since the begin-
ning of the 20th century. Heavy harvest losses
have been reported from Scandinavia, Latvia,
Germany and the Czech Republic (Laska 2011). In the Netherlands this species has not reached
pest status. Trioza centranthi (Vallot, 1829)

lands was by Docters van Leeuwen & Alta
(1946): flower galls on Valerianella dentata. Docters
van Leeuwen (1957, 1982, 2009) reported galls of
T. centhranthi ftom the province of Limburg
(Nijswiller and Gulpen). Trioza centranthi has been reported throughout
Europe, but not on the Iberian Peninsula and
northern Scandinavia (Burckhardt 2013, Jerinié-
Prodanovié 2010, Ripka 2008, Seljak 2006). It
is also known from North Africa, Turkey, the
Caucasus and Israel (Burckhardt 1989, Burck-
harde & Onugar 1993, Ossiannilsson 1992,
Spodek et al. 2017). Ossiannilsson (1992) listed as host plants, besides
the already mentioned Valerianella dentata and
Centranthus ruber, also Fedia cornucopiae, C. an-
gustifolius, V. carinata and V, locusta. Immacures
living in leaf axils and inflorescences cause severe
malformations: curling of the leaves, flowers fail
to develop and remain green (Ellis 2018, Gross-
curt 2017, Ossiannilsson 1992). Trioza centranthi
is a univoltine species, the adults overwinter on
conifers. In some southern regions overwintering
can also take place as egg and immature, and the
life cycle may comprise more than one generation
per year (Hodkinson 2009). Trioza cerastii (Linnaeus, 1758)
Galls induced by T, cerastii on leaves and flowers

of Cerastium arvense, C. fontanum subsp. vulgare
and C. semidecandrum were reported from the

Netherlands by Docters van Leeuwen & Alta
(1946) and Docters van Leeuwen (1957, 1982,
2009) based on material from Castricum (Noord-
Holland) and Bergeijk (Noord-Brabant). Waar-
neming.nl gives only one recent report of a gall
produced by 7. cerastii: Ede (Gelderland), gall on
C. fontanum subsp. vulgare, leg. M. van Bergen. ‘Adults of this species have not been collected in
the Netherlands yer. Trioza cerastii is widespread in Europe (Baugnée
2013, Burckhardt 2013, Ripka 2009, Seljak 2006,
Serbina et al. 2015b, Ossiannilsson 1992). The
report of this species from China (Ossiannilsson
1992) needs confirmation (Baugnée 2013). Trioza cerastii develops on Cerastium species,
besides the already mentioned three species also
on C. fontanum subsp. holosteoides (Ossiannilsson
1992) and C. alpinum (Hansen & Greve 1999). Malformations caused by the immatures include
strongly shortened apical internodes and fusiform
flowers and buds in which the immatures devel-
op. Flowers are more or less chlorotic (Baugnée
2013, Doctors van Leeuwen 2009, Ossiannilsson
1992). There is one generation per year, the adults
overwinter on conifers. Adults can be found
throughout the year (Hodkinson 2009, Ossian-
nilsson 1992). Trioza flavipennis Foerster, 1848

Docters van Leeuwen & Alta (1946) reported the
galls of 7: flavipennis for the first time from the
Netherlands. Docters van Leeuwen (2009) illus-
trated the leaf galls on Aegopodinm podagraria
induced by this psyllid and mentioned this species
as rather common. Material of adults from the
Netherlands has not been available. On Waar-
neming.nl, data on galls of 7 flavipennis on the
leaves of A. podagraria ate available from all over
the country, documented with photographs:

Flevoland (Almere), Utrecht (Breukelen, Soest),
Gelderland (Ellecom, Nijmegen, Oosterhout,
Wageningen), Noord- Brabant (Breda, Gilze). Trioza flavipennis occurs all over Europe (Burck-
harde 2013, Hansen & Greve 1999, Malumphy et
al. 2009, Ripka 2009, Seljak 2006, Serbina et al. 2orsb, Ossiannilsson 1992). It is monophagous on. A. podagraria. Eggs are deposited on the under-
side of the leaves and around each egg a typical
pit gall develops (Conci et al. 1993, Ellis 2018). ‘The immatures remain on the underside of the
leaf, moving only after each moult. Oviposition
and gall formation have also been observed on
Heracleum sphondylium. However, it seems im-
probable that 7. flavipennis can complete its life
cycle on this plane (Lauterer 1993a). It is a uni-
voltine species, the adults overwinter on conifers
(Ossiannilsson 1992). Trioza galii Foerster, 1848

Trioza galii was reported from the Netherlands
for the first time by Van der Goot (1912) and
Blite (1926b). It is quite common in the Dutch
meadows that are not intensively used. Adults
were collected from May until September. Burckhardt & Lauterer (2006) unravelled the

T. galii complex and recognized four species of
which 7; drosopouli Burckhardt & Lauterer, 2006
is a Greek endemic, 7; cocquempoti Burckhardt
& Lauterer, 2006 is a mediterranean species and
Trioza galii and T. velutina Foerster, 1848 are
widely distributed in the Palaearctic region. Due
to the critical taxonomy older records are ques-
tionable. Trioza galii is widely distributed in the West
Palaearctic region and Central Asia. The older
records from the East Palaearctic area need con-
firmation. The presence of T. galii has been con-
firmed from Algeria, Armenia, Austria, Bulgaria,
Czech Republic, Cyprus, France, Germany, Great
Britain, Greece, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kazakhstan,

Kyrgyzstan, Malta, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain,
Switzerland, Turkey and Tunisia (Burckhardt &
Lauterer 2006). Trioza galii lives on Galium album, G. aparine,

G. palustre and Asperula cynanchica but may occur
on other host plants (from Rubiaceae) as well. ‘The number of generations is unclear; in respect
of the relatively short adult period in the Nether-
lands one generation seems probable. Adults over-
winter on conifers or in leaf litter (Burckhardt &
Lauterer 2006, Hodkinson 2009). For identification we refer to Burckharde &
Lauterer (2006). Trioza galii was also reported
from the Netherlands based on galls found on
Galium verum (Docters van Leeuwen & Alta
1946, Docters van Leeuwen 1957). However, in
more recent publications of Docters van Leeuwen
(1982, 2009) Trioza velutina Foerster, 1848 replaced
T. galii, with the same description as previously
given for 7: galii. This mutation was probably
initiated by W.H. Gravestein. Because the fifth
instar larva of 7; velutina is unknown it is not
possible to identify immatures from the galls at
this moment. Consequently, there is no justified
reason to change the name from T. galii to

T. velutina in these cecidological publications. Trioza remota Foerster, 1848

Blate (1926b) reported 7. remota ftom the Nether-
lands for the first time, Throughout the Nether-
lands it is a widespread species occurring on
Quercus. Leaf galls induced by T: remota on

Q robur and Q. petraea were reported from the
Netherlands by Docters van Leeuwen (2009)
and Grosscurt (2017). Adults were recorded from
February until December. Trioza remota occuts throughout Europe but

has not been reported from the Iberian Peninsula
and parts of the Balkan. It has also been recorded
from North Africa and the East Palacarctic region,
including Japan (Burckhardt 2013, Ossiannilsson

 

 

NEDERLANDSE FAUNISTISCHE MEDEDELINGEN 53 — 2019

1992). The records from East Asia may refer
to other species and need revision (pers. obs. D. Burckhardt). Trioza remota is nartowly oligophagous on decid-
uous oaks such as Quercus boissieri, Q. pubescens,
Q robur, Q. petraea and perhaps other species
(Ossiannilsson 1992, Seljak 2006, Spodek et al. 2017). It is an univoltine species overwintering in
the adult stage on conifers. Oviposition on oaks
starts in May, immatures then induce small pit
galls on the lower leaf surface which are present
on the leaves from May until October. Adults
emerge in September and stay on oaks for another
month before migrating to conifers (Ellis 2018). Like in the Netherlands, adults can be collected
throughout the year (Hodkinson 2009, Ossian-
nilsson 1992). Trioza urticae (Linnaeus, 1758)

Van der Goot (1912) and Bléte (1926b) reported
T. urticae from the Netherlands. It is by far the
most common psyllid species occurring through-
out the Netherlands. Adults were collected from
January until November. Trioza urticae is widely distributed throughout
the Palacarctic region and has been reported from
almost every European country (Burckhardt 2013,
Ossiannilsson 1992, Ouvrard 2018, Wonglersak et
al. 2017), In Europe 7. urticae lives primarily on
Urtica dioica and U. urens but also on U. dubia
(Hodkinson & White 1979). Single eggs are laid
on both sides of the leaves and on young twigs. Bladder-like leaf galls on Urtica dioica and U. urens
were found in the Netherlands (Docters van
Leeuwen & Alta 1946, Docters van Leeuwen 1957,
1982, 2009, Grosscurt 2017). Trioza urticae is a
multivoltine species with up to four generations
in England. The adults overwinter on conifers but
also in the litter under nettles and can be found
throughout the year (Conci et al. 1996, Ossian-
nilsson 1992). The adults of 7. urticae ate very variable in
colour. The thorax and head of young adults is
light green ot yellowish. Older adults darken

gradually and bear extensive fuscous markings. Trioza velutina Foerster, 1848

much less common in the Netherlands. However,
older records of the 7. galii complex should be
re-examined because the distinction between

T. galii and T. velutina has been made only re-
cently (Burckhardt & Lauterer 2006). Trioza velutina is probably widely distributed in
the Palaearctic region. So far it has been recorded
from the following European countries: Austria,
Belarus, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany,
Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Russia. Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland, and
also from Algeria, Altai, Armenia, Dagestan,
Turkey and Turkestan (Burckharde & Lauterer
2006, Seljak 2006, Serbina et al. 2015b). The biology of 7; velutina is insufficiently known. Probably it develops on Galium species on which
adults have been collected (Burckhardt & Lauterer
2006). It occurs in sunny, dry to mesic grasslands,
e.g. meadows, pastures and waysides (Malenovsky
& Lauterer 2012). For identification see Burckhardt & Lauterer

Lanka, South Africa, South America, southeastern
usa, Great Britain, Ireland, Spain (including
Canary Islands), Portugal (including Azores and
Madeira), France and Italy (Hodkinson 1999,

recorded from greenhouses in central European
countries (Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary,

introduced with potted Eucalyptus trees but can-
not survive outdoors (Burckhardt & Lauterer
2003, Burckhardt & Miihlethaler 2003, Ripka &
Cabka 2016, I. Malenovsky unpublished data). This is probably also the case of the Dutch record
which concerned Eucalyptus plants imported to
the Netherlands from Italy. Ctenarytaina eucalypti is narrowly oligophagous on
several Eucalyptus species (Hodkinson 1999, Ouvrard
2018, Queiroz & Burckhardt 2007). It causes
problems particularly on E. globulus, E. pulverulenta
and E. dunnii which are widely grown in planta-
tions (Hodkinson 1999, Queiroz & Burckhardt
2007). The life cycle in Great Britain is continuous
with several overlapping generations a year and
both immatures and adults overwintering together
in the rolled evergreen leaves of the host plant
(Hodkinson 1999). The immatures preferably
develop on the growing shoots of young succulent
plants or on the new growth of older trees. Mature

trees with older foliage are less susceptible than
young saplings or seedlings. Crenarytaina eucalypti
is considered a pest of Eucalyptus nurseries and
newly established plantations, causing serious
shoot dieback, leaf curl and leaf discoloration,
massive production of honeydew and cosmetic
damage in foliage used for decorative purposes
(Hodkinson 1999, Queiroz & Burckhardt 2007). For identification see Hodkinson (2007). Liviidae

This Australian species has been introduced into
different continents: North and South America,
Africa and Europe (Hodkinson & Hollis 1987). In
Europe it has been found in the Azores, Canary
Islands, France, Great Britain, Italy, Malta, Monte-
negro and Portugal (Burckhardt 2013, Halstead

bunda, in Israel on A. saligna and elsewhere on
Acacia confusa, A. koa, A. koaia, A. verniciflua and
Albizia lophantha, In several areas it has become
a minor pest on ornamental or native acacias
(Hodkinson & Hollis 1987). In the Netherlands, A. uncatoides has been noted
only once in a big center for ornamental plant
trade. The potential for this pest to establish and
cause damage is considered to be low due to un-
favorable climatic conditions and because the host
plants cannot survive outside of greenhouses and
households in the Netherlands. Acizzia uncatoides
has multiple generations per year, all stages (eggs,
immatures and adults) are able to overwinter
(Hodkinson 2009). For identification see Hodkinson & Hollis (1987). Other imported Australian psyllid species can be
expected considering the situation in the United
Kingdom (Malumphy & Luker 2014). SPECIES DELETED FROM THE DUTCH LIST

Aphalaridae
Aphalarinae

Aphalara calthae (Linnaeus, 1761)

Both Van der Goot (1912) and Blite (1926b)
mentioned A. calthae from the Netherlands. Fauna
Europaea listed this species as doubefully present
in the Netherlands (Burckhardt 2013). Alll available
specimens previously identified as A. calthae in
the Dutch collections turned out to be A. fiji. Therefore, A. calthae is deleted from the list of
Dutch psyllid raxa. Aphalara exilis (Weber & Mohr, 1804)

Van der Goot (1912) included A. exilis in the
Dutch faunal lise based on a note of G.A. Six,
however no collecting data were given. Blote
(1926b) did not cite this species from the Nether-
lands. Docters van Leeuwen (2009) attributed
galls on the flower buds of Rumex acetosella to
payllids cf. A. exilis based on Redfern & Shirley
(2002; pers. comm. J.C. Roskam). However,

A. polygoni and A. ulicis also develop on R. aceto-
sella (Burckhardt 2002) and can produce defor-
mations of the host plant. No reliable record of A. exilis from the Nether-
lands is known to us, therefore this species is
deleted from the Dutch psyllid lise. Craspedolepta artemisiae (Foerster, 1848)

Bléte (1950) reported three specimens (as
Aphalara artemisiae) from the utmost south of
the Netherlands close to the Belgian border:
Sine Pietersberg (province of Limburg). Two of
Blite’s specimens were retrieved from the Naturalis
collection and both proved to be C. omissa. Therefore, the report of C. artemisiae from the
Netherlands is based on a misidentification. Craspedolepta artemisiae is known from central
and eastern Europe as well as Kazakhstan and the
Russian Far East. The reports from Spain and Japan
seem doubeful (Burckhardt 2013, Klimaszewski
1973, Konovalova 1988, Lauterer & Malenovsky
2002, Loginova 1963, Ouvrard et al. 2015a). In central Europe, C. artemisiae seems to be
monophagous on Artemisia campestris (Burck-
hardt 2002, Lauterer & Malenovsky 2002, Ouvrard
et al. 2015a). This plant is scarce in the Nether-
lands and occurs in two subspecies A. campestris
maritima in the sea dunes and A. campestris camp-

estris at some inland localities. It has never been
reported from Sine Pietersberg (Floron 2015), an
area thoroughly researched by Dutch botanists. Looking at the distribution of the host plant and
the distribution of C. artemisiae, it seems improb-
able that C. artemisiae is a member of Dutch fauna. For identification see Burckhardt (1983), Loginova
(1963) and Wagner (1947). Craspedolepta innoxia (Foerster, 1848)

Bléte (1954) collected one female near Sint Piet-
ersberg: Nieuwe Doline (Maastricht, Limburg) on
19.v11.1950. Based on the female terminalia and
another male collected close to the collecting site
in 1949, the material of Bléte (1954) has been
reidentified here as belonging to C. omissa, As there
is no other record of C. innoxia from the Nether-
lands, this species is omitted from the Dutch lise. Craspedolepta innoxia is distributed in ceneral

and eastern Europe and Algeria, Armenia, Israel,
Kazakhstan and Turkey (Burckhardt 1989, Droho-
jowska & Burckhardt 2014, Loginova 1963, Spodek
et al, 2017). Daucus carota and Seseli leucospernum
(Apiaceae) are reported as the host plants of C.
noxia (Burckhardt 2002, Lauterer 1965). Nothing
has been published on the lifecycle of this species. For identification see Burckhardt (1983), Loginova
(1963) and Vondraéek (1957). Aphalaridae
Rhinocolinae

Agonoscena targionii (Lichtenstein, 1874)

Agonoscena targionii was mentioned by Aulman
(1913) from the Netherlands. Based on this cata-
logue also Blate (1926b) mentioned this species
for the Netherlands. No Dutch museum material

is available. Agonoscena targionii develops on
Pistacia species, a mediterranean plant which is
not indigenous in the Netherlands. For identification see Burckhardt & Lauterer
(1989). Liviidae
Liviinae

Livia limbata (Waga, 1842)

This species was published from the Netherlands
by De Graaf et al. (1862) based on two individuals
collected in August by G.A. Six near Utrecht
(province of Utrecht). However, they stated that
these specimens lacked the darker brown pattern
at the tip of the fore wing. This character distin-
guishes Z. limbata from all other European Livia
species (Hodkinson & Bird 2000). Therefore, this
material probably did not belong to L. limbata. Hodkinson & Bird (2000) mentioned L. limbata
from the Netherlands based on the paper of Van
der Goot (1912) who referred to the same material
as De Graaf et al. (1862) but did not examine

it himself, In Dutch collections, no material of
L, limbata is available. For these reasons, L. lim-
bata is not included in the list of Dutch psyllid
fauna here. Liviidae
Euphyllurinae

Psyllopsis discrepans (Flor, 1861)

Payllopsis discrepans was reported from the Nether-
lands by Doctors van Lecuwen (2009) who stated
that the immatures were different from 2 fiaxini
and that both species produced the same type of
gall on the leaves of Fraxinus excebsior. However,
no reference to material or literature was given. The first author sampled F exceltior extensively

 

 

NEDERLANDSE FAUNISTISCHE MEDEDELINGEN 53 — 2019

for psyllids without ever collecting P diserepans in
the Netherlands. Currently no Dutch material of P diserepans is
available and therefore it is tentatively removed
from the list. However, this species occurs in all
neighbouring countries and therefore it can be
expected in the Netherlands. Psyllidae
Psyllinae

Cacopsylla alaterni (Foerster, 1848)

Van der Goot (1912) reported C. alaterni from
the Netherlands based on Six (1876). Cacopsylla
alaterni is monophagous on Rhamnus alaternus
(Conci et al. 1993), a mediterranean plane species
that does not occur in the Netherlands. $

 

indi-
cated that he collected ‘C. alaterni’ on Hippophae
in the dune area. The association with Hippophae
suggests that the report concerns Cacopsylla hip-
‘pophaes ot C. zetterstedti, not C. alaterni. The
occurrence of C. alaterni in the Netherlands is
highly unlikely. For identification see Burckhardt (1989) and
Loginova (1975). Cacopsylla elegantula (Zetterstedt, 1840)

De Graaf et al. (1862) and Van der Goot (1912)
mentioned the only Dutch record of C. elegantula
from the environs of Utrecht, leg. G.A. Six. Blite
(1926b) and Burckhardt (2013) did not list this
species from the Netherlands. Cacopsyla elegantula
has mainly a northern and central European dis-
tribution (Burckhardt 2013). It develops on Salix
species (Ossiannilsson 1992, Lauterer & Burck-
harde 1997). Despite extensive search on willows
in the Netherlands by the first author, C. elegan-
tula has never been found and no material of

C. elegantula is present in the Dutch collections. Because of this, C. elegantula is not included
among species occurring in the Netherlands at
present. However, its discovery in the Nether-
lands in the future is probable (table 1). Cacopsylla nigrita (Zetterstedt, 1828)

Bléte (1926b) listed C. nigrita from seven Dutch
localities (Den Haag, Overveen, Bodegraven,
Zierikeee, Rhenen, Putten, Arnhem). Cacopsylla
nigrita is widespread in the western Palaearctic
region and perhaps also Japan. It occurs all over
Europe except for the Balkan, Great Britain and
Ireland (Burckhardt 2013, Lauterer & Burckhardt
1997, Ossiannilsson 1992). Cacopsylla nigrita is
another of the many Salix feeding Cacopsylla
species. It is associated with the broad-leaved
species Salix caprea, S. lapponum, S. myrsinifolia
and S. phylicifolia. The life cycle is univoltine
with overwintering in the adult stage. Immatures
are found in the female catkins. In Scandinavia,
adults were captured throughout the year (Os-
siannilsson 1992). Cacopsylla nigrita is relatively easily recognizable
by its characteristic brownish spot on its fore
wings and the male parameres (Lauterer & Burck-
harde 1997, Ossiannilsson 1992). Blote (1926a)
published an identification key but his description
of the parameres resembles C. moscovita and other
related species more than C. nigrita. The first
author collected extensively on Salix species but
has never found this species in the Netherlands. In the Dutch collections no material of C. nigrita
could be located. Thus, as there is no confirmed
record of C. nigrita from the Netherlands, this
species is not included in the list of Dutch psyl-
lids here. However, C. nigrita occurs in the neigh-
bouring countries and it is likely it will be recorded
in the Netherlands in future. DEN BIEMAN ET AL. ~ CHECKLIST OF THE DUTCH JUMPING PLANT LICE

 

 

Psylla betulae (Linnaeus, 1758) is available and can be revised based on modern

Together with the 27 species reported here for
the first time from the Netherlands, the Dutch

Bactericera femoralis (Foerster, 1848) psyllid fauna includes 69 species. In addition, there
are three alien species (Acizzia uncatoides, Ctenary-

from Dutch botanists and entomologists. Several
psyllid species in the Netherlands are only known
from their galls (Ellis 2018, Doctors van Leeuwen
1941, 1947, 1957, 1987, 2009, Doctors van Leeuwen
& Alta 1946, Grosscurt 2017). The Dutch psyllid fauna as a whole has not been
extensively studied. However, in comparison to
neighbouring countries the number of Dutch
psyllid species is relatively high. Belgium counts
67 species (Baugnée et al. 2002, Baugnée 2003,
2013), 82 psyllid species have been recorded from

Great Britain (Boffing & Bantock 2014) and 119
from Germany (Burckhardt & Lauterer 2003). Many mote species are to be expected in the
Netherlands. Table 1 gives an overview of species
most likely to be found in the Netherlands based
on the presence of their host plants and estab-
lished occurrence in neighbouring countries. We
hope our contribution will stimulate entomo-
logists to study this interesting group in the
Netherlands more intensively in future. Table 1. Psylloidea to be expected in the Netherlands. Be = Belgium, Ge = Germany, Gp = Great Britain

SAMENVATTING

De eerste naamlijst van Nederlandse bladvlooien sinds 93 jaar (Hemiptera: Psylloidea)
De Nederlandse bladvlooien hebben altijd maar beperkt in de belangstelling gestaan van Neder-
landse entomologen. Dat blijke al uit het jaartal van de laatste naamlijst (Blite 1926b). Daarna
zijn wel enkele losse artikelen verschenen maar nooit meer cen overzicht. Deze geringe belangs-
telling is verwonderlijk omdat cen aantal soorten schadelijk kunnen zijn. Met name de peren-
bladvlooien veroorzaken jaarlijks voor enkele tientallen miljoen euro schade. De gallen die
sommige bladvlooien veroorzaken op hun waardplant hebben de aandacht getrokken van
Nederlandse botanici met als belangrijkste pionier Docters van Leeuwen. Vetschillende soorten
bladvlooien zijn uit ons land alleen bekend door hun gallen. Echter deze botanische kennis
heeft geen ingang gevonden in de entomologische literatuur. In dit overzicht van de Nederlandse bladvlooien zijn meldingen in de literatuur van nieuwe soorten
zoveel als mogelijk gecontroleerd aan de hand van museummateriaal. Soorten zonder ondubbelzinnig
bewijs dat 2ij in Nederland voorkomen zijn niet opgenomen. Als bewijs geldt museummateriaal
of goede foto's van gallen op de waardplant. In totaal worden 27 soorten als nieuw voor ons land
gemeld: Aphalara avicularis, A. fiji, A. polygoni, A. purpurascens, A. ulicis, Craspedolepta flavipennis,
C latior, C. nebulosa, C. omissa, C. subpunctata, Camarotoscena speciosa, Psyllopsis distinguenda,
Cacopsylla sorbi, C. ulmi, C. ambigua, C. pulchra, C. affinis, C. erateagi, C. pyrisuga, C. rhamnicola,
Livilla variegata, Spanioneura fonscolombii, Bactericera curvatinervis, B. reuteri, B. silvarnis,

B. substriola en Trioza velutina. In totaal tele de lijse van Nederlandse bladvlooien nu 69 soorten. Dertien soorten zijn afgevoerd van de naamlijst: Aphalara calthae, A. exilis, Craspedolepta arte-
misiae, C. innoxia, Agonoscena targionii, Livia limbata, Pyyllopsis discrepans, Cacopsylla elegantula,
C. nigrita, C. alaterni, Pylla betulae, Bactericera femoralis en B. salicivora. Drie soorten (Acizzia uncatoides, Ctenarytaina eucalypti and Euphyllura olivina) zijn als import-
soort bekend maar hebben zich nog niet gevestigd. Vijf soorten zijn aan te merken als exoten
waarvan er én van buiten Europa komt (Cacopsylla fulguralis) en vier afkomstig zijn uit Zuid-
Europa: Livilla variegata, Pylla buxi, Spanioneura fonscolombii en Lauritrioza alacris. Van elke soort wordt de biologie besproken waarbij vooral aandacht gegeven wordt aan de
waardplanten, het aantal generaties, de wijze van overwintering en de eventuele schadelijkheid. Tot slot worde een overziche gegeven van soorten die in Nederland te verwachten zijn, gebaseerd
op de verspreiding in buurlanden en de biologie van deze soorten. C.EM. (Kees) den Bieman D. Burckharde
