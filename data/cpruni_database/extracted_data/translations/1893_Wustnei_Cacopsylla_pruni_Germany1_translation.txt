Aconitum, Viola, Syringa, Calendula, Lilium candidum ete. but
nevertheless they may have occurred in the garden. It is different
perhaps with Aster chinensis L. This flower so common today
is also missing in the Gottorp collection, as well as in Weinmann's
Phytanthozaiconographia, which appeared in the period 1737-1742. in the
"Horti academici Lugduno - Batavi Catalogus" by Paul Herrmann,
1687, it does not exist either. So it will probably be closed first

and the Flora Leydensis from Royen, Leyden 1740. 1) The news about Tropaeolum majus comes from Paul Herrmann, Horti aca-

Rose culture also only comes from later times. Anemone nemorosa L. is filled with in the pastor's garden
flowers cultivated, BI. 218; in the Gottorp collection it comes close to
if before (vol. 3, plate. 48,b) and Kylling also mentions them in his
Viridarium Danicum, Copenhagen 1688, on p. 134, by Randers in
Jiitland. So it was pretty common back then and that's why
the "Weisz Anemone" p. 1 can mean the same plant. A second plant from our native forests, which are filled with
flowers has been cultivated is Convallaria polygonatum L., the Solomon's
Seal. It is shown on sheet 183. In the Gottorp collection
is she in vol. 3 on plate. 8, b shown; Kylling gives them (ibid.,
p. 124) from Norburg on Als; she came a few years ago
in Husum and attracted particular attention because of its beautiful scent. Finally there is Melandryum album Grcke, the white light-
carnation, with filled flowers, sheet 4, mentioned. She must be very good
looked like, but has apparently fallen into oblivion. The last three plants are mainly mentioned in order to
show what can be achieved from plants of the homeland through culture for the garden

cuculi L. shown (cf. Gartenflora 1892, issue 7; Erfurt illustrated

a diversity that is seldom encountered. The garden of

Water masses contained work force already practically at many

a small preliminary attempt has been made

Even if this attempt has not yet produced any practical results

demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing the wind. The Institute's accumulator battery, made up of 32 elements of the
Hagener accumulator factory should be fully charged and
elements connected in series a current strength of 7 amperes
deliver at a voltage of 61 volts. With a small dynamo
Such currents could be generated with a machine from Siemens & Halske. The following setup has now been made. Mr. Manufacturer

Results of the daily measurements in Kiel in the years 1890 to 1892 87

To the table I note that in this arbitrarily as an example
readings have been taken several times in the months referred to,
where the setting r was less than 9 cm, thereby creating a
certain uncertainty, which is incidentally unimportant for the overall results
brought in, which would have been avoided if it depended on them
the mounting of the rotatable tube around a frosted glass plate
had been increased. In the following table II are the 5-day means of the observation
respects from the three years 1890-92 compiled. although
the extraordinarily strong jumps, which the brightness of a
Day to the following sometimes shows, here already significantly softened
appear, the fluctuations are nevertheless so large that the
graphical representation in a very strongly jagged and little overlaid
visible curve would exist even on the basis of
the three-year mean values ​​of the individual pentads,

Only the monthly mean of the brightness, which is shown in Tab. III for the
3 years are put together, show a reasonably even
periodic course throughout the year. Whether the hint
of a double summer maximum is a more deeply rooted one
probably only decide after a large number of years of observation. Should such a thing really emerge with continued observation
pose, then there would undoubtedly be a strange relationship between
Light distribution in the atmosphere to see the frequency of thunderstorms
be, which latter also has a double summer maximum. Results of the daylight measurements in Kiel in the years 1890 to 1892. Tab. III. monthly

Although such a method of calculating the equivalent value,
as explained above, for the Tayeslicht is not entirely perfect, so
it may nevertheless be regarded as a preliminary approximation. In order to gain an overview of the extent to which the measured
total daylight falling on the horizontal frosted glass panel

of the heavenly vault, I have in Tab. VII diejeniye Hellig-

air fell on it, i.e. the diffuse light of the sky
dazzles goods. This calculation can be carried out with the help of
those measurements which Dr. Michalke in the years 1884-86
made in Breslau at my instigation). In contrast to the

On Leonard Weber,

Wélkung stand on the ratio of the two color measurements is
in table VIII reproduced an excerpt from the observation journals,
in which, according to the degree of cloudiness, those of the individual

the number of observations. The first number 4.071 4 means,
that in the 3 January months 1890-1892 on 34 days at a
cloud 10 has been on average hg/hr = 4.071. With decreasing cloudiness the ratio hg/hr
decrease slightly until cloudy 1 to again on clear days
experience a small increase. Finally I add to the above notices that

minor difficulties. Our way of thinking and looking at things is from

not least, through our schools. Everyone now knows

Rudolf Falb, but also about the theories of Laplace, Darwin,
Wallace etc. But maybe that's why it has its good side

see briefly how it was with natural history in antiquity

until the 4th century B.C. Chr. Birth. Of course you already have
previously worried about animals, plants and stones, but as the father
of natural history, as the first to use natural bodies as counter-
state of scientific research looked at and treated, we must
consider the philosopher and statesman Aristotle. he was in
years 384 BC Chr. born in Stagira in Macedonia, which is why he is

personal achievements have also become known by the fact that he

mere servant of medicine, and that condition has continued into this

because of its old name "Physica"; but before we start
going into the consideration of its contents, we must first of all
linger for a moment on the life story of its author. Saint Hildegard came from a knightly family and

years she lived in the monastery of the Benedictines in Disibodenberg,

Milk, honey, sugar, vinegar are also mentioned. Most books start
with a short preface in which Saint Hildegard expresses her views

the second from the elements (de e/ementis), the third from the trees
(de arboribus), the fourth of the stones (de lapidibus), the fifth
from the fishes (de piscébus), the sixth from the birds (de avibus),

Natural history has done to appreciate properly, one must
remember that she lived in a time when there were independent observations
respects was almost entirely absent, but where the traditional, namely
what was written was regarded as indisputable truth. Furthermore one has
to note that Saint Hildegard of a very lively and
was inspired by deep religiosity. She believed in direct traffic
with spirits, and from this their visions can be explained. that god
Active and active everywhere in nature was, of course, hers
conviction, but at the same time she also believed that the devil in direct
relationships with some natural bodies. This worldview
always emerges clearly when it comes to more general representations
or portrayals; occasionally you meet her too
when discussing a single natural body. The following will now attempt to express the views of the saints

according to old belief, air, water and earth become, but not fire
mentioned. The water is used to clean teeth and as an antidote
certain women's diseases recommended. The sea sends out the rivers,
by which the earth is watered, as well as the body of man
through the blood of the veins. Some rivers emerge from the sea
in violence, others gently, others in storms. That explains it to you

it protects the sheepskins from decay so that they do not wear out. The mineral data are divided into two books. That
one, entitled "Of the Stones," deals almost entirely with the
precious stones. These have fire and moisture in them. They are
originated in southern countries, where under the influence of the solar
radiate the mountains glow and the streams carry boiling water, and
indeed in that the streams overflowing their banks with the glowing
come into contact with the soil. The formed gems are then
led by the rivers themselves to cooler regions. But the devil
hates the jewels, because they remind him of his former glory
remember and because they arose from the fire in which he himself
punishment suffers. You can therefore use gems to kill evil spirits
exorcise Of precious stones are called: emerald, hyacinth, onyx,
Beryl, Sardonyx, Sapphire, Topaz, Chrysolite, Jasper, Carbuncle, Diamond,
rock crystal, etc.; but pearls are also mentioned, the real ones
pearls, margaritae, and the river pearls called erin. The freshwater pearls arise in certain shellfish, and the goodness of these
Pearls that are useless for medicine because they are supposed to be poisonous is
dependent on the place of residence of the shellfish. Yes, if you focus on a something
wanted to engage in energetic interpreting, then one might be familiar with it
read from the text that Saint Hildegard put one in the shell
penetrating foreign bodies as the cause for the formation of the pearl
have viewed. In addition to the precious stones, the following are mentioned: Magnet,
Alabaster, as well as quicklime, which is called crefa, and in a
In the final chapter it is stated that the other stones, such as marble,
Griesstein, Kalkstein, Duckstein, Wacke and the like for medicine
have no great value. Saint Hildegard knows eight metals: gold, silver,
Lead, tin, copper, brass, iron and steel. The steel comes as whole
particularly effective remedy against poisons: one suspects poison in
in a liquid, this is caused by a glithendes dipped into it
piece of steel, if not destroyed, at least greatly weakened,
and solid foods, such as meat, fish, and kidney, become thereby poisonous
freed that they are poured over with wine into which a glithendes
piece of steel put into it. The fear of poison ruled the whole thing
Middle Ages and its medicine. To understand this fear
one has to consider that at that time many animals were considered poisonous,
which in reality are not, such as weasels, grass snakes, slow worms,
lechse, toad, spider and many others (this superstition is quite
by no means gone), and that everything about which these ‘here

crept there, or absorb poison into whatever was struck by their breath
or even turn into poison. From what has been said it is clear that Saint Hildegard
was just as caught up in the views of her time as we are in
those of the present: she just writes down what was then
was meanly believed and what she therefore believed. But nice
at the river pearls we saw that she had been observing on her own. This is still more evident in other animals, e.g. B. in the fish. She is very well informed about the process of spawning and also knows
the most important freshwater fish, such as the salmon species, Hausen, stir, catfish,
Pike, perch, carp, stickleback, gryndling, crucian carp, eel, eel caterpillar,
Lampreys, etc. According to local custom, she counts the crayfish
among the fish. From sea fish she knows the haring, which she allec
names; also the whale and the guinea pig, among which they called dolphins
and seals, enumerates them among fish. She considers all reptiles or crawling animals to be poisonous. At the top stands the dragon *), a fabulous beast who knows his existence

root or a dead branch. Then snakes come in
general, slow worm, toad, frog, tree frog, lizards, spiders,
Adders, the fabulous basilisk, scorpion, earthworm, the awivorm

Among the birds or flying animals is the griffin
first mentioned. It is said of the ostrich, s¢rusz, that although it is a bird
have wings, but do not fly with them, that he throws his fish in the desert

The collections received from Kiel contained mainly from
Nolte collected mosses, as well as those from Ecklon, L. Hansen,
Mrs. Etatsrath J. Liiders, P. Hennings, by myself and by some
unnamed observers. A special small fascicle contains the
Moss collection by Frélich, partly in common with himself

the years 1820-1825 and his observations extend to
by the year 1824 almost exclusively over the south-eastern area, namely the
Sachsenwald, Trittau, Ratzeburg and Liibeck-Travemiinde. From the
1825, where he made his journey to North Schleswig and the North Frisian
made islands, mosses from these regions are found in
his herbarium. The mosses collected around Kiel, resp. the information
therefore are mostly from 1823 and refer to a few

male plant, resp. a stalk part, which after the far

This moss is absent in the north German plain, although it grows
also from Warnstorf in the Mark and from Klinggraeff in East
and West Prussia and near Bromberg. a
change is all the less to be assumed here, since a second

drawn moss. But the same is with hermaphrodites
pictured and also described in the text as hermaphrodite, the eyelashes
of the inner peristome are very short. In my opinion
it is far more likely to represent B. inclinatum. That the lid short and crooked
is beaked may be a change, the text only says:

This species is often associated with Br. pseudotriquetrium var. gracilescens
been confused with whom she likes to be together, often in the-
same lawn occurs. Also on the latter Moose, that with
brother Duvalii habitually has the greatest resemblance are the leaves
running down rather far, narrow, but often very narrow
still clearly fringed, the one that thins out very much towards the top
Rib reaches apex or emerges even as shorter, at times
weakly perforated spine. Bryum Duvalii, on the other hand, has
completely sessile leaves and the rib disappears into or
under the top. The leaves are more pointed, the cell network
the same is looser. If these two plants with us until-
have often been confused with one another, that is how it is
largely due to the defective description in the
handbooks, especially in the much-used Bryologia silesiaca
of mildness, in which the important distinguishing feature of the
missing leaf margin in B. duvalii is not even mentioned
Also in the Br. euros and in Schimper's synopsis this is not
the case, while the very good illustration Br. euros tab. 371
shows the same thing clearly. — In Additamenta ad Bryologiam Danicam
notes Th Jensen that the locations specified by him
of B. duvalii partly to B. pseudotriquetum var. Duvalioides
Itzigs. (flaccidum Schpr.) belong. The poor description
this form at Schimper and Limpricht would also refer to the
by me as B. pseudotriquetrum var. gracilescens respected
plant, with the exception of the capsule, which is described as
is drawn as I lengthen it club-shaped and long-
have found throaty. But in the vast majority of cases
only sterile the moss. The locations of the B. davalii given above, the
I have not been able to check, may also be based, little-
at least partly on the above-mentioned confusion. B, turbinatum (Hedw, under Mnium) Schwigr., Br. euros tab. 372 On damp sandy soil, in swollen places, in cutouts,

correct, since the specimens in Nolte's herbarium belong to other species

So far we have dealt only with animals that are close by
live on the surface. The closing net catches of the plankton expedition
have now established for the first time with certainty that not all
existing species at the same time occur near the surface,
that some are found only at very specific depths. One can distinguish about three regions in the vertical direction. The uppermost region descends to about 200 m; because most
animals, which occasionally occur in great numbers on the surface,
on the other hand, it is not uncommon to find them down to about this depth. Below the 200 m limit one finds, from individual exceptions
apart from that, almost only other species, yes mostly even other genera. If you want to distinguish between a middle and a deep region
so the demarcation should be done best at about 1000 m. 288 Fr, Dab. For the surface regions are, except those hitherto named

It must also be noted that the horizontal spread

they go farther to the pole than the surface animals, and out

The following speaker, Dr. Schaper-Liibeck spoke about that
geomagnetic fault area in Holstein, known
deviates in our Geyenden the magnetic needle to the west of the
astronomical north direction. This deviation should, as usual,
be greater in western regions than in eastern ones. But this is
not so in a part of central Holstein, but in the region
between Plén and Neuminster the declination is greater than west
from Neumünster. This phenomenon, which is called a disturbance area
denoted, is less evident in the magnetic inclination,
at least as far as observations go so far, it shows up
but clearly in the magnetic force expression in the horizontal direction. This force component does not decrease northwards, as might be expected,
but has a greater value in the region described above
than all around. Accordingly, the vertical component must also
be falling large. A conjecture about the reason for these disturbances
is not available. Magnetic rocks have not yet been found here,
the more striking is the presence of the disturbance area and
all the more interesting is the investigation of the question of whether and how
changes over time. The lecturer asks for help
