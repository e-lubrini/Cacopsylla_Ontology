Abstract A nationwide monitoring with regard to the
presence and distribution of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum’ and its vector, Cacopsylla pruni, has been
carried out in Germany between 2013 and 2017. In total,
286 sites with cultivated and wild Prunus species were
surveyed. 806 plant samples covering 94 administrative
districts in all 13 federal area states and one city-state
were analysed by PCR. Furthermore, 3108 C. pruni
were caught in 63 districts and tested for ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’. European stone fruit yellows was found
mainly in symptomatic apricot, plum, almond and peach
but also for the first time in Germany in sweet cherry. Non-symptomatic infections were detected in 437 ran-
domly sampled P. spinosa at 104 sites without any stone
fruit growing nearby representing a natural infection rate
of 14%. The vector C. pruni was found on all P. spinosa

plants at 62 sites spread across Germany. The infection
rate of C. pruni was 1-2% regardless whether the insects
were caught in stone fruit growing areas or at wild
habitats. Our results strongly indicate that ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ is widespread in all natural habitats in Ger-
many and that wild P. spinosa represent a major source
of infection in stone fruit orchards. A representative
sample of 1164 individuals of C. pruni captured at 100
sites was molecularly typed: all but one insect were of
B-type, the one which is the proven vector of ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’. C. pruni A-type was detected for the first
time in Germany near the French border. Keywords ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ -

Introduction

Several economically important disorders on Prunus are
collectively referred to as European stone fruit yellows
(ESFY) (Lorenz et al. 1994; Cieslifska 2011; Marcone
etal. 2011): apricot chlorotic leaf roll of apricot (Prunus
armeniaca), leptonecrosis of Japanese plum
(P. salicina) and yellows and decline diseases of peach
(P. persica), European plum (P. domestica), almond
(P. dulcis) and flowering cherry (P. serrulata). A unique
pathogen is associated with ESFY, the phytoplasma
‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ (Seemiiller and
Schneider 2004). The incidence of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’
depends on the region and species of the tree. Particu-
larly susceptible are apricot, peach and Japanese plums. © Springer

Severe outbreaks were observed since 1977 especially
in the Mediterranean basin (Marcone et al. 2010, 2011). Due to its high economic importance ‘Ca. P. prunorum’
is currently regulated as quarantine organism in the EU
in Annex IAII of Council Directive 2000/29/EC
(Anonymous 2000; Steffek et al. 2012). Infected trees show numerous symptoms depending
on the susceptibility of the plant species, the rootstock
and scion cultivar, virulence of the infecting strain, age
of the tree and climatic conditions. The typical symp-
toms which can be observed in most of the infected
Prunus species are off-season growth and premature
break of leaf buds before flowering. In summer, leaf
yellowing or reddening in combination with leaf roll is
the common symptom (Marcone et al. 2011). These
symptoms are highly correlated with the presence of
the phytoplasma as detected by molecular means
(Jarausch et al. 1998; Jarausch et al. 2008). Infected
trees may also show less specific symptoms like leaf
deformation, reduced terminal growth, die-back and
decline. ESFY is known to occur in most southern and central
European countries (Ciesliftska 2011; Marcone et al. 2010, 2011) but it has also been detected in Asia Minor
(Jarausch et al. 2000; Sertkaya et al. 2005; Tedeschi
et al. 2013; Allahverdi et al. 2014; Valasevich and
Schneider 2016) as well as in northern Africa (Ben
Khalifa et al. 2011). Its highest spread is in the Mediter-
ranean basin while its northern border ranges from
England (Davies and Adams 2000) via Germany
(Jarausch et al. 2007b) to Poland (Cieslinska and
Morgas 2011). In Germany, the first detection of the
agent in different Prunus species has already been re-
ported in 1992 by Lederer and Seemiiller. Carraro et al. (1998) identified the psyllid species
Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli) as vector for ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ in Italy and Jarausch et al. (2001) confirmed
the vector capacity of this psyllid species in France. In
Germany, C. pruni was confirmed as vector in transmis-
sion trials conducted by us (Jarausch et al. 2007a). C. pruni is a European and Central Asian species which
is known from almost all of Europe (Lauterer 1999). This univoltine psyllid is strictly oligophagous on Pru-
nus spp. and overwinters as an adult on conifers
(Jarausch and Jarausch 2016; Gallinger and Gross
2018). At the end of winter/early spring, C. pruni
remigrants move from the overwintering plants back to
Prunus for oviposition. The insects of the new genera-
tion feed on the reproduction hosts until the beginning

of July when they leave the stone fruits as adults to
move to overwintering hosts (Thébaud et al. 2009). The phytoplasma multiplies during winter in the psyllid
making the returning migrants highly infective. The
disease spread is regarded to be monocyclic (Thébaud
et al. 2009; Jarausch et al. 2013). The natural infection
rate of C. pruni varies according to the region: in France,
Germany and Bulgaria low infection rates between 1
and 3% were observed (Yvon et al. 2004; Jarausch et al. 2007a, b; Thébaud et al. 2008; Etropolska et al. 2015),
whereas from Italy (Carraro et al. 2004) and Austria
(Maier et al. 2013) rates of more than 10% were
reported. Nation-wide surveys for the presence of ESFY dis-
ease have only been conducted in stone fruit growing
areas, e.g. in France (Jarausch et al. 1998), Turkey
(Ulubas Serge et al. 2006), Spain (Sabaté et al. 2015)
or Bulgaria (Etropolska et al. 2015), and confirmed a
wide-spread presence of ESFY in orchards of suscepti-
ble species like apricots, Japanese plum and peach. During a survey between 2000 and 2006, Jarausch
et al. (2007b) could show that ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ as well
as its vector, C. pruni, were present on all cultivated
Prunus species in several stone fruit growing regions in
Southwestern Germany. The role of wild Prunus for the spread of ESFY was
first studied by Carraro et al. (2002) in the heavily
ESFY-infected region Friuli-Venezia Giulia in Northeast
Italy. They found ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ as well as C. pruni
in P. spinosa and P. cerasifera also at sites far from
stone-fruit orchards and concluded that the cycle of
ESFY can be completed independently from the pres-
ence of ESFY-infected cultivated stone-fruit trees. These
results were confirmed by Yvon et al. (2004) in a case
study in Southeastern France who detected ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’-infected P. spinosa and C. pruni in a hedge-
row of blackthorn. While Carraro et al. (2002) did not
find ESFY-infected wild P. mahaleb, Sabaté et al. (2015)
recently reported high infection rates from wild
P. mahaleb bushes as well as from C. pruni caught on
these plants from Catalonia, Spain. As these authors did
not find infected P. spinosa, they concluded that
P. mahaleb is a key factor in the local ESFY cycle in
Spain. In the present study, a nationwide monitoring was
conducted between 2013 and 2017 including cultivated
and wild Prunus spp. in order to elucidate the real
presence and distribution of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ and its
vector C. pruni all over Germany. Based on this data it

was the final goal to identify the epidemiological traits
of ESFY disease and to contribute to the revision of its
quarantine status in the EU. Material & methods

The first part of the study was initiated 2010 by
the AlPlanta Institute and comprised some selected
fruit growing areas in Germany as continuation to
those regions already published in Jarausch et al. (2007b, 2008). A comprehensive nationwide mon-
itoring was started 2013 including plant and insect
samples on symptomatic cultivated Prunus spp. from all German stone fruit growing regions in a
first step. Between 2014 and 2017 the study was
completed by a second part comprising plant and
insect samples on wild non-symptomatic Prunus
spp. located far from cultivated stone fruit areas
all over Germany. Monitoring of Prunus species

The monitoring of ESFY infection on cultivated Prunus
spp. was based on surveying symptomatic plants in fruit
growing areas all over Germany. Visual inspections as
well as sampling of suspicious plants was basically done
by plant health inspectors in their particular zone of
responsibility and by farmers in their own orchards
during summer before harvest. Branch samples of about
30 cm length were taken directly from symptomatic
parts or from different parts all around a suspicious tree
and sent to AlPlanta for molecular analyses. Localiza-
tion of the sampling site was documented via GPS
coordinates or exact description of the location and
photographs. This way it was possible to establish pre-
cise maps of all sample sites in Germany. The monitor-
ing of wild Prunus spp. was less evident as infected
P. spinosa or P. cerasifera do not show symptoms. One
part of this survey was focused on wild Prunus hedge-
rows in the vicinity of fruit trees. A second part of
sampling included wild Prunus habitats far from fruit
growing areas based on the experience of AlPlanta
researchers with regard to putative risk pools and ag-
glomeration sites for C. pruni. Branch samples of about
30 cm length were taken from wild Prunus spp. erraneously. Captures of C. pruni

Based on data on C. pruni population dynamics in Ger-
many (Jarausch et al. 2007b) insect monitoring started by
mid-March on wild Prunus spp. — mostly P. spinosa-
where the highest population of C. pruni remigrants appear
after hibernation. Survey of C. pruni was undertaken on. wild Prunus spp. and cultivated Prunus all over Germany
from March until July including overwintered remigrants
as well as individuals of the new generation (emigrants). Insect samples were taken by researchers of AlPlanta using
the beating tray method. Captured psyllids were frozen at
—20 °C and C. pruni identification was done using differ-
ent determination keys (Ossiannilsson 1992; Burckhardt
and Jarausch 2007). Molecular detection of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in plant
samples

Phloem was prepared from 1 to 3 branches per plant
sample and total nucleic acids were extracted with a mod-
ified CTAB-based protocol as described by Jarausch et al. (2011). All plant samples were tested with the 16SrX
group specific primers f01/rO1 as published by Lorenz
et al. (1995). Identification of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ was done
with specific primers ESFY-f/ESFY-r as described by
Yvon et al. (2009). In samples with low phytoplasma
concentration which gave only a faint band in direct PCR. with primers fO1/rO1 the following nested PCR approach
was adopted for ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ identification: a first
PCR was performed using forward primer f01 (Lorenz
et al. 1995) and reverse primer P7 (Schneider et al. 1995)
in a final volume of 20 ul with 1x Taq polymerase buffer
with 1.5 mM MgCl, 0.125 mM of each dNTP, | uM of
cach primer, 0.5 U of Sprime Taq polymerase (Sprime,
Germany) and 1 ul of total DNA in cycle conditions of
1 min at 95 °C for initial denaturation followed by 20 cy-
cles at 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 1 min
30 s, with a final 4-min extension period at 72 °C. One
microliter of the PCR reaction was further amplified for
40 cycles with the specific primers ESFY-f/ESFY-r as
described by Yvon et al. (2009). Molecular detection of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in insect
samples

DNA was extracted from each psyllid individual with
the modified CTAB-based protocol according to
Jarausch et al. (2011) or with the TNES protocol,

presented by Nicolas Sauvion at the COST FA0807
molecular identification training school in Montpellier,
September 2012 (Sauvion 2012). PCR amplification of
phytoplasma DNA was achieved with universal ribo-
somal primers fU5/rP7 (Lorenz et al. 1995; Schneider
etal. 1995) as described in Jarausch et al. (2011) or with
the 16SrX group specific primers fO1/rO1 as published
by Lorenz et al. (1995). Identification of ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ was done as for plant samples with specific
primers ESFY-f/ESFY-r as described by Yvon et al. (2009). Molecular typing of C. pruni

Molecular typing of C. pruni specimen was done ac-
cording to the protocol of Peccoud et al. (2013): the
universal primer Cp480R (5’-TACATCCGAGGGTC,
GGTATC-3’) was used in triplex PCR together with
the group-A specific primer CpA300F (5’-
GGCCAGTAGTTAAACCGGACT-3’) and the group-
B specific primer CpB120F (3’-TCCACGGG
GTCCGCGATA-S’). The PCR was performed in a final
volume of 20 yl with 1x Taq polymerase buffer with
2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.125 mM of each dNTP, 0.25 uM of
each primer, 0.5 U of Sprime Taq polymerase (Sprime,
Germany) and | ul of total insect DNA. PCR cycles
were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min
followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 65 °C for 20 s
and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final 4-min extension period at
72°C, PCR products were analysed on 2% agarose gel
stained with ethidium bromide for visualization under
UV light. Specific PCR products of C. pruni type A had
asize of 172 bp, whereas PCR products of C. pruni type
B had a size of 377 bp. Positive controls for C. pruni
types were kindly provided by Nicolas Sauvion (INRA
Montpellier). Results
ESFY detection in plant samples

In a first survey conducted in 2013 to 2014, plant
samples were mainly obtained from cultured Prunus in
stone fruit growing regions. Special attention was given
to plants with typical ESFY symptoms like early bud
break or chlorotic leaf roll, but plants with suspicious
symptoms like pale leaves or non-chlorotic rolled
leaves, were also sampled. In 2014, samples were also

D Springer

taken from wild Prunus which is predominantly Prunus
spinosa and less common P. cerasifera in Germany. In
particular P. spinosa does not show any ESFY symp-
toms. Therefore, samples were taken randomly from 5
to 10 plants per site. Wild Prunus were sampled near
stone fruit growing areas but mainly in regions without
stone fruit growing in order to monitor the spread of
ESFY all over Germany. In 2015 to 2017, special sur-
veys were conducted in non-stone fruit growing areas,
e.g. in the North and East of Germany. All samples were
tested with 16SrX group-specific primers and ESFY-
specific primers. Table | gives a summary of the results
obtained for all 13 federal area states plus the city of
Berlin. ESFY infection was detected at 133 out of 258
sites in all states. More details about the sites and the
results are given in Tab. S1. Table 2 shows an analysis of the data with respect to
the cultured Prunus species. Apricot (P. armeniaca) is the
major stone fruit damaged by ESFY also in Germany. Samples were obtained from eight federal states and
showed a relatively high infection rate of 67%. Peach
(P persica) is also very susceptible to ESFY but infection
with ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ could only be confirmed in 36%
of the samples. The third major ESFY-susceptible stone
fruit crop in Germany is European plum (P. domestica). Although plum trees rarely show typical symptoms 43%
of the samples tested positive. A special case is almond
(P. amygdalus) which is grown in Southwest Germany
for ornamental reasons. Almond trees show typical bud
break symptoms and, accordingly, 100% of the samples
were positive. Cherries are known to be fairly resistant to
ESFY (Jarausch et al. 1999). Therefore, these crops were
only sampled when suspicious symptoms were observed. These were chlorosis and sudden death of the plant. For
the first time in Germany, ESFY infection in sweet cherry
(P avium) could be confirmed by specific PCR. Surpris-
ingly, wild non-symptomatic P. spinosa in the neighbor-
hood of stone fruit orchards were found in 37% of the
cases to be infected with ‘Ca. P. prunorum’. This result
prompted us to test P. spinosa more systematically in wild
habitats where no stone fruit growing areas were nearby. ESFY detection in insect samples

“Ca. P. prunorum’ is transmitted only by one vector, the
psyllid Cacopsylla pruni. The monitoring included
therefore sampling of this vector for two reasons: 1)
the distribution of C. pruni in Germany and thus the
risk for ESFY spread should be elucidated, and 2) ESFY

infection in wild habitats far from stone fruits growing
areas should be detected by the presence of ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ in the vector. It is known that the major
natural host plant of C. pruni is P. spinosa (Lauterer
1999; Carraro et al. 2002). Therefore, C. pruni was
mainly captured on P. spinosa. A detailed list of the
sampling sites is given in Tab. $2. Captures of C. pruni
were predominantly done in 2014, only additional cap-
tures were done between 2015 and 2017. Table 3 gives a
summary of the C. pruni samples and the detection of

found in all 12 federal area states tested plus Berlin. No
sampling could be conducted in Mecklenburg-
Vorpommem for technical reasons but the presence of
C. pruni in this state is highly probable. Therefore, it can
be concluded that C. pruni is well established in every
region of Germany as it was found at all 97 sites tested. In total, 3108 insects were captured and individually
tested by PCR. By this the natural infection rate could
be determined. It ranged between 0.8 and 2.0%. Species N° N°

However, infected C. pruni were only found at 30 out of
97 sites. This was probably due to the low number of
individuals captured at many sites (s. Tab. $2). In 2014,
2516 remigrants were captured and 45 tested positive
(1.8%) whereas only 481 emigrants could be captured
from which 6 were positive (1.2%). A striking differ-
ence was observed between both sexes in 2014: whereas
males encountered only for one third of the captures
they had an infection rate of 2.8% (30 positive out of

Table. 4 Molecular determination of C. pruni type

21 out of 1920 were infected (1.1%). Sauvion et al. (2007) and Peccoud et al. (2013)
reported on two different molecular types of C. pruni
which might even be two different species. Therefore, a
representative number of C. pruni individuals was mo-
lecularly typed as described by Peccoud et al. (2013). Table 4 gives a summary of the results. In total, 1163
individuals representing 100 different sites across

Germany were of C. pruni B-type which is regarded to
be the C. pruni reference type. However, for the first
time in Germany an individual of C. pruni A-type was
detected very close to the French border at Saarland. Distribution of ESFY in Germany

The monitoring included plant and insect samples be-
cause it offered also the opportunity to sample at differ-
ent times during the year and, thus, to sample at more
places. Insects were sampled from March to May when
they are on their host plant and plant samples were
sampled in summer until autumn when symptoms are
visible. Additional plant samples were obtained during
winter until early spring when bud break symptoms
occur. Thus, to show the pervasive distribution of ESFY_
in Germany, positive plant and insect data were merged. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of positive and negative
sampling sites in Germany. It can be seen that ESFY is
present all over the country independent of stone fruit
growing regions. Distribution of ESFY in wild habitats

One unexpected result of the monitoring was the nation-
wide presence of ESFY in wild habitats. Table 5 shows
the data for plant and insect samples obtained from wild
habitats separately. It can be seen that ESFY is present in
all 13 federal area states in natural environment. This is
further demonstrated in Fig. 2 were all data of wild
habitats are shown. A total number of 437 asymptomatic
P. spinosa samples was analysed for these areas and
14.4% of these samples were positive for ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’, Natural infections of P. spinosa were found
in every state where a substantial number of samples
were collected. This signifies that ESFY is well
established in the natural environment in Germany. It
has been found at extreme places ranging from Alpine
regions to coastal regions (s. Tab. $1). Accordingly,
infected C. pruni were also detected in several states. The natural infection rate of C. pruni was 1.4%. In
comparison, ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ infection in C. pruni
captured on P. spinosa in fruit growing areas in 2014
was 2.0% (27 positive out of 1366). The infection rate of
C. pruni from commercial apricot and plum orchards
was 1.2% (three out of 243 samples; s. Tab. $2). Addi-
tional captures of C. pruni in an experimental apricot
orchard with known ESFY spread at Neustadt
(Rhineland-Palatinate) revealed an infection rate of

remigrants of only 0.5% in 2014 (one out 192
individuals). Discussion

European stone fruit yellows is a quarantine disease
which is regulated in Europe and other countries, It is
reported from 11 EU and six non-EU countries (Steffek
etal. 2012). None of these countries declares the disease
to be ‘widespread’ probably because country-wide mon-
itorings are missing. ESFY was first described in France
(Chabrolin 1924) and a survey in France with molecular
means showed that it was found in all areas tested
(Jarausch et al. 1998). ESFY is well studied in southern
countries with important apricot and peach growing
where it causes large economic losses (Steffek et al. 2012), however, its distribution in northern countries
with only local apricot growing areas is largely un-
known. Germany is considered to be at the Northern
border of ESFY distribution (Steffek et al. 2012). There-
fore, the objective of the present work was to study with
regard to the quarantine status of ESFY the nationwide
distribution in Germany, in particular if ESFY-free re-
gions exist in Germany or whether the disease is
endemic. Although European stone fruit yellows was first de-
scribed in Germany in 1992 (Lederer and Seemiiller
1992), the distribution of this quarantine disease was
largely unknown. We conducted first surveys since
2000 in stone fruit orchards in Southwest Germany
and found high infections in apricot orchards. ESFY
was also detected in peach and European plum orchards
as ell as in almond grown for flowering (Jarausch et al. 2007b, 2008). We also confirmed the presence of
C. pruni in Germany and proved by transmission trials
its vector capacity (Jarausch et al. 2007a, 2008). During
these surveys ESFY was detected only in one case also
in wild Prunus cerasifera adjacent to stone fruit or-
chards. Thus, the question whether this quarantine path-
ogen was introduced into the orchards by latently in-
fected planting material or by natural spread from the
wild habitats remained unanswered. To test for ESFY-free regions, samples were mainly
obtained from non-stone fruit growing regions and wild
habitats. As in addition cultured Prunus from orchards
or planted cultivations like almonds for flowering were
tested, the obtained result is a first nationwide overview
of the distribution of ESFY in wild and cultured habitats. © Springer

Our data clearly demonstrate that ESFY is endemic in stone fruit growing. As the vector, C. pruni, is also
Germany. It was not only found in major stone fruit widespread in Germany, a natural cycle of ESFY main-
growing regions but also in wild habitats far from any tenance in wild Prunus is guaranteed. C. pruni is a

European and Central Asian species which is known
from almost all of Europe (Lauterer 1999). ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ might have been introduced to Europe from
Asia along with the susceptible Prunus species like
apricot and peach but ESFY has never been reported
outside Europe apart from Asia Minor and North Africa. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that ESFY is an
endemic European disease with a natural cycle includ-
ing wild Prunus. As these wild autochtonous European
Prunus like P. spinosa and P. cerasifera are tolerant to
the disease, a coevolution between pathogen and plant
host can be assumed. In Germany, the dominant and
most widespread wild Prunus species is P. spinosa. This
plant does not show any symptoms of ESFY (Carraro

et al. 2002; Jarausch et al. 2008; this work) but can be
infected. It has to be regarded as less susceptible. In
addition, it is the preferred host plant of C. pruni
(Lauterer 1999) and accordingly, we found C. pruni on
every P. spinosa tested — sometimes at high population
densities. This is supported by data from Carraro et al. (2002), Yvon et al. (2004) or Maier et al. (2013). ESFY is widespread in wild habitats as we found in
our random sampling a mean infection rate of about
14% and a nationwide distribution of infected plants. This is in the range of local infection rates of wild
P. spinosa reported from other countries: 25% infections
were found in France (Jarausch et al. 1998) and Italy
(Carraro et al. 2002), 12% in Austria (Maier et al. 2013)

only between 1 and 2%. This confirms our previous
results (Jarausch et al. 2007a, b), only in heavily infected
apricot orchards infection rates of up to 5% were found
(Jarausch et al. 2007b). Similar low infection rates were
observed in France by Jarausch et al. (2001), Yvon et al. (2004) and Thébaud et al. (2008) or in Bulgaria
(Etropolska et al. 2015). By contrast, much higher in-
fection rates were reported from Austria (Maier et al. 2013) and Italy (Carraro et al. 2004). Despite this low infection rate infected remigrants
represent a high risk for susceptible stone fruit orchards
as the univoltine species overwinters on conifers
(Jarausch and Jarausch 2016; Gallinger and Gross
2018) and remigrates to Prunus in early spring
(Thébaud et al. 2009). At this time the individuals are
highly infectious (Jarausch et al. 2007a; Thébaud et al. 2009) and the dispersal in the orchard is more or less
randomly on a regional scale (Thébaud et al. 2006,
2009). Accordingly, we found high infection rates in
susceptible stone fruits like apricot and Japanese plum
confirming previous data from Southwest Germany
(Jarausch et al. 2007b, 2008) as well as from other
countries (Marcone et al. 2010, 2011). Our nationwide
data confirm also the relatively low infection rate of the
highly susceptible peach (Jarausch et al. 1998, 2007a,
2008). A new finding for Germany is ESFY infection of
sweet cherry. In general, phytoplasma decline diseases
of sweet and sour cherry remain unclear as different
phytoplasmas have been found to be associated
(Navratil et al. 2001; Paltrinieri et al. 2008; Cieslifska
and Morgas 2011). An ESFY-related decline in sweet
cherry was first observed in the Southwestern part of
France and was called ‘Moliéres disease’ (Bernhard
et al. 1977) but turned out by molecular means to be a
stolbur type (Jarausch, personal comm.). However, ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ infection of sweet and sour cherry was
confirmed in few declining trees in Czech Republic
(Navratil et al. 2001; Ludvikova et al. 2011) and in
North-Central Italy (Paltrinieri et al. 2001). In contrast,
experimental inoculations of thirteen sweet cherry cul-
tivars with ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ demonstrated a high level
of resistance in P. avium (Jarausch et al. 1999). We
found two isolated cases of sudden decline in sweet
cherry and could confirm infection with ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ with ESFY-specific primers. This indicates
rather a hypersensitivity to ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ than a
high resistance. Sauvion et al. (2007) and Peccoud et al. (2013)
hypothesised the existence of two species of C. pruni

based on genetic analyses. These two C. pruni types A
and B can easily be distinguished by a triplex PCR. However, it remains unclear whether both types can
transmit ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ as transmission trials have
been conducted before the identification of the two
types. In Southern France both types coexist and might
have been used in transmission trials (Peccoud et al. 2013). We made an exhaustive molecular typing of the
C. pruni captured all over Germany and found with one
exception only C. pruni B-type. The exception is a
recent finding of A-type next to the French border. The
A-type was for the first time found in a northern country
outside of France. We therefore can conclude that our
previous transmissi
the B-type. The B-type is also the dominant type across
Europe (Peccoud et al. 2013) and has been recently
reported to be the only type found in Bulgaria
(Etropolska et al. 2016). Also the phytoplasma is not homogenous. Multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) of the marker genes imp, aceF,
pnp and secY revealed at least 34 different haplotypes
within the species ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ (Danet et al. 2011). Moreover, differences in strain virulence were described
by Kison and Seemiiller (2001) and others. Danet et al. (2011) and recently Dermastia et al. (2018) could corre-
late the aceF type A6 to hypo-virulent strains which
induce no or only mild symptoms in Prunus. We con-
tributed 22 German isolates covering 5 stone fruit grow-
ing regions with 16 apricot or peach orchards to the
MLST analysis of Danet et al. (2011). Eight different
haplotypes of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ were identified. The
main haplotype aceF A3-pnp P1-imp I1-secY $1 was
found in all regions and was identified by Dermastia
et al. (2018) as founder haplotype of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’. The dominant aceF types in Europe (A3 and A8) were
also dominant in German isolates. The major imp type
IL in Europe accounted also for 77% of the German
isolates. By contrast, the two A6 types identified in the
analysis originated both from symptomatic trees indi-
cating that this marker alone is not sufficient to charac-
terize hypo-virulent strains (Dermastia et al. 2018). We
conclude that the genetic variability of the German
isolates of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ has no impact on our
results as it does not differ from other European regions. We believe that our results are representative for
central European countries. E.g., ESFY has been report-
ed to be widely present in Czech Republic (Navratil
et al. 2001) and Poland (Cieslifska 2011). There is no
reason to exclude natural ESFY infections also in

 

 

n trials have been carried out with

northern countries like Scandinavian countries where
P. spinosa and C. pruni are present (Steffek et al. 2012). Thus, ESFY should no longer be regarded as a
quarantine pest. Our results have also important conse-
quences for the protection of orchards planted with
susceptible crops like apricot and peaches. Infection
sources are not only infected trees inside the orchard
but have to be looked for rather outside in the wild
environment. Control of incoming C. pruni remigrants
in spring is therefore of paramount importance. Acknowledgements The nationwide monitoring was supported
