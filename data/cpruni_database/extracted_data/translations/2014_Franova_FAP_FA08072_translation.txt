Abstract

The total number of participants involved in the Action was 367 of which 60% of females
and 32% of early stage researchers. Total publications were about 800 (list available at
heep://www.costphytoplasma.ipwgnet.org/publications.htm). Innovative knowledge resulting from COST networking through the Action

The comparison of diagnostic protocol for phytoplasma identification towards the
achievement of harmonized protocols for rapid and reliable detection of fruit trees and
grapevine phytoplasma-associated diseases, and the report of phytoplasma molecular
diversity in diverse Countries, in different host plant and vector species, were obtained. Identification of molecular markers to follow insect vector population distribution,
particularly for fruit tree phytoplasmas, was also achieved. A network for insect vector
identification to increase the knowledge about phytoplasma disease epidemiology
was established. New phytoplasma-associated diseases, new insect vectors and new
phytoplasma host plants were identified. Dedicated schools were carried out to handle
sampling for phytoplasma detection in plants and insects, and to identify their vectors
by specific molecular tools, in some cases developed during the action. Morphological
and molecular tools developed were used to improve knowledge on vector ecology and
for a more precise timing of control measures application. Information about existing management strategies for sustainable phytoplasma disease
control was shared, and the application of developed tools helped to propose strategies
for obtaining healthy planting material. Research conducted on genetic and induced
resistance to phytoplasmas in fruit trees and grapevine, development of innovative
control strategies against vectors and application of genetic resistance in apple, and
model systems to study the genetic base of the resistance mechanism were established. The presence of genetic resistance to pear decline and European stone fruit yellows
was screened and attempts to identify genetic resistance in grapevine were undertaken. Basic molecular and histological research on phytoplasma-recovered fruit trees and
grapevine led toa better understanding of the reaction of the plant towards phytoplasma
infections. Strategies proposed are to induce resistance by bioactive compounds (mainly
in grapevine) or to screen for resistance induced also by endophyte presence. Today, control of the insect vector is the most efficient way to limit the spread of
phytoplasma diseases in fruit trees and grapevine. Focusing on the development of
environmentally friendly strategies basic data on the identification of the vector species

Introduction

or population, as well as on the biology of the insect vectors was achieved. A totally
new control strategy based on plant info chemicals used either in traps or as repellents
was established in apple and stone fruits. Molecular characterization of the microbial
communities associated with different species and populations of leafhopper and cixiid
vectors were studied and the endosymbiont ‘Candidatus Sulcia muelleri’ was detected
in populations of Hyalesthes obsoletus and Reptalus panzeri, both vectors of “stolbur”. Whole genome sequences of multiple diverse phytoplasmas were obtained through
a community-wide sequencing effort, named phytoplasma genome sequencing
initiative (PGSI), which involved the collection of DNA from phytoplasma-infected
plants and insects worldwide. During the genome annotation schools analyses of
phytoplasma sequences were carried out. Current and future phytoplasma genome
sequence information is being integrated into a single website and used to investigate
the molecular basis of phytoplasma diseases in plants and insects. Some of the published
work show the presence of a link between phytoplasma genomics achievements and
insect vector transmission, including the discovery of phytoplasma genomic islands
encoding genes that are upregulated during phytoplasma colonization of insects. The
identification of some phytoplasma virulence genes that are expressed in insects and
plants, and the presence of insect vector-specific diversification of variable membrane
proteins of stolbur and “flavescence dorée” phytoplasmas, used as molecular markers for
epidemiology, were also achieved. Significant scientific breakthroughs. New diseases associated with phytoplasmas and differentiation of phytoplasma
strains associated with quarantine phytoplasmas such as “flavescence dorée” and apple
proliferation were reported. A first MLST (multilocus sequence typing) survey of fruit
tree phytoplasma genetic diversity at the scale of the Euro-Mediterranean basin was
published. Characterisation of 16Sr DNA of “bois noir” phytoplasma strains showed
the presence of genetic variability of this phytoplasma in grapevine. Coniferous trees
and shrubs were firstly described as natural host plants of diverse phytoplasmas. The
Phytoplasma Genome Sequencing Initiative lead to the sequencing and annotation of
the first genome drafts for the phytoplasma agents of pear decline, European stone fruit
yellows, “flavescence dorée”, grapevine yellows from German Palatinate, rubus stunt,
decline of Nigerian coconut, yellows of African napier grass, maize bushy stunt and
witches’ broom disease of lime. Diverse targets of phytoplasma effectors were studied to
elucidate pathogenicity mechanisms: SAP 11] in Arabidopsis plants show crinkled leaves
and increase in stem numbers as in the witches’ broom phenotype; SAP54 transformed
plants exhibit leafy flowers; SAPOS transformed plants has long slender leaves and
early flowering. Amplification of HIB gene of apple proliferation phytoplasma allow
the differentiation of severe and mild strains and evidence that strain composition
determines disease severity in multiply infected apple trees. Actinidia spp. was reported

Introduction

as a phytoplasma host and possible interaction between phytoplasmas and the Psa
(Psudomonas syringae pv actinidiae) strain(s) was proposed. Tangible medium term socio-economic impacts

The increase of public awareness about phytoplasma diseases with emphasis on filling
gaps in national awareness of phytoplasma disease threats was achieved. Specific projects
were initiated and risk awareness was increased in farmers and growers; information
was also added into EPPO web site, as a first step to improve sanitary conditions in
nurseries and orchards. Development of a more effective integrated control of the main
phytoplasma diseases is expected by the use of resistant plant material, environmentally
friendly insect vector control strategies, and efficient disease management. Theawareness
was extended to international Countries where specific projects were initiated and
new phytoplasma-associated diseases reported. Environmentally friendly insect vector
control strategies, efficient disease management through early protection measures and
the use of phytoplasma-free material were proposed together with innovative tools
such as the use of endophytes and the practical application of some ‘recovery’-related
techniques to reduce the impact of diseases. Promotion and dissemination

Abstract

‘A web site for the COST action FA0807 was set up soon after the start of this action. This site was intended to be a tool to meet one of the most important goals of the action:
to disseminate phytoplasma related knowledge and to connect researchers in the field of
phytoplasma research. Two independent software programs were used to monitor the
traffic on the web site. The results of these programs indicate that the FA0807 action’s web
site contributed importantly to the dissemination of phytoplasma related knowledge. Key words: knowledge transfer, internet, results, publication. Introduction

Asthe main objective in the COST action FA0807 was to promote information exchange
in order to design integrated phytoplasma management strategies (Memorandum of
Understanding, _ http://www.costphytoplasma.ipwgnet.org/publications.htm), an
important goal was to set up a web site for this action. The web site appeared to be an
outstanding tool for disseminating the COST action’s output. This output comprises a
list of publications written by COST action’s contributors, STSM reports, minutes and
reports of meetings and workshops. Publication of practical items, such as protocols,
pictures of symptoms, phytoplasma vector tables, and geographical information on
the occurrence of phytoplasmas and their vectors, contributed greatly to phytoplasma
research updating. Besides the dissemination of output, the web site proved to be a tool to connect people
in the field of phytoplasma research. Every working group presented member lists on the
web site, allowing researchers to connect to each other and to build their professional
network. And last, but not least, the web site was built in such way that it was informative
and attractive to the wider public interested in plant diseases, and particularly diseases
associated with phytoplasma presence. This chapter presents some comments on the web site set up and its functionality, as
indicated by the results of web site usage statistics software. 15

Introduction

Web site set up

The COST action FA0807 web site was launched in July 2009 with the Uniform
Resource Locater (URL) http://www.costphytoplasma.eu. Since the COST Action
FA0807 has ended, the web site was transferred on 1 January 2014 to the IPWG web
site, and is now available at the URL http://www.costphytoplasma.ipwgnet.org. The pages were organized in such a way that both general information and Working
Group (WG)-specific information could be found fast and simply. From the home
page, one could easily navigate to the pages for ‘Objectives, ‘Working groups, ‘Symptom
images’ (Figure 1), ‘Insect vectors, ‘Meetings, ‘News, ‘Publications, ‘Short-Term
Scientific Missions (STSM); ‘Links’ and ‘Contact’, and underlying pages. Also a search
engine was built in to provide accurate searches within the COST FA0807 web site. Apple poliation Wj Arpt rlieation

Figure 1. Example of the COST action FA0807 web page; the phytoplasma symptoms photo gallery. Web site usage statistics

To obtain information on the effective usage of a web site, specialized web usage
statistics software is available. On the COST FA0807 web site’s server, two programs
were installed to monitor the web site’s statistics: 1) the Analog web server statistics
(htep://www.analog.cx/) and 2) Webalizer Version 2.23 (hetp://www.webalizer.org/). Introduction

Both programs keep track of e.g. the number of requests for pages or files, IP addresses
of visitors, search strings entered in Search Engines (such as Google, Bing), etc. In this overview three examples will be presented that illustrate the success of the action’s
web site. These examples are: 1) the number of requests for pages or files, indicating the
number of visits or hits by people requesting information on phytoplasma research, 2)
the countries from which persons accessed the action’s web site, and 3) the query words
that were used in Search Engines to find or approach the action’s web site. Traffic on the web site (number of requests and data transfer)

From the launching of the COST Action FA0807 web site in July 2009 until the
end of the COST action in December 2013, many requests (hits) were counted,
indicating a great interest in the information on this site. The total successful requests
during this period were over 2 million (2,053,167, with an average of 1,282 per day). The amount of data transferred during this period was 132.79 gigabytes (the average
data transferred per day: 83.77 megabytes). An overview of the number of requests
per month shows that the traffic just after launch was already over 15,000 hits per
month, but this figure increased rapidly in the following period. Peaks in these figures
were observed mostly just before meetings of the COST Action, indicating that
delegates used the web site to gain information regarding the meeting. The largest
peak in the number of hits was counted in the period in which the final meeting in
Lisbon was organised, in October 2013. During this period the number of hits per
months exceeded 60,000 (Figure 2). number of requests per month

The COST FA0807 action’s web site: a tool to reach out to the world

One of the features of the Webalizer tool is the logging of the country belonging to
the IP address of the web site visitor. Every month a top 30 of the visiting countries
was displayed. Unfortunately, this software does not generate an overview for the
entire period of this COST Action. The average of visiting countries during the last
four months was 79. In Table 1, the top 25 countries of the month October 2013 is
listed. A considerable part of the visitors has an IP address which was not linked to a
certain country, and so they were listed as unresolved/unknown, commercial (.com)
or as network (.net). Table 1 also shows that the web site visitors are not exclusively
located in countries which are member states in this COST action, but originate from
countries all over the world. This illustrates the benefit of an easily accessible web site
with information useful to the general and scientific public. Table 1. Top 25 countries of 82 (total) in October 2013 (source Webalizer). Rank Country Hits Files Kbytes

Queries used in Search Engines

But only displaying good information is not good enough. It is significant that the web
site can be found easily by the most commonly used Search Engines, with the most
common query words that visitors enter in their search windows. An example of the
most used search strings can be found in Table 2, and an overview of the most used query
words in Table 3. It is clear that words like phytoplasma and COST would bring the web
surfer to the COST actions’ web site, but also words like grapevine and identification
were used to navigate to the FA0807 web site. Introduction

Concluding remarks

As shown by the results of two independently operating web usage statistics programs,
we can conclude that the COST FA0807 action’s web site was very successful in reaching
researchers and the general public who are interested in phytoplasma research. During
the COST action’s period, over 2 million times information was requested from the

Abstract

While Denmark resulted to be the only COST FA0807 Country where phytoplasmas were
never detected, the project allow detection and/or confirmation of phytoplasma-associated
disease presence as well as of potential insect vector in Norway, Finland and Lithuania. All
these countries located in the Northern part of the EU are believed to be not seriously affected
by phytoplasma diseases, however, during the project reports have emerged on the presence
of phytoplasmas in Norway, and Finland in an important agricultural plane species such as
apple. Moreover in Lithuania confirmation of phytoplasma presence and of their genetic
polymorphism were reported and potential insect vectors of phytoplasmas were also found. Key words: phytoplasmas, insect vector, molecular identification, disease, epidemic. Introduction

The improvements on phytoplasma and vector knowledge in Finland, Norway and
Lithuania in the frame of the COST FA0807 are of great importance for whole EU. The information concerns also new plant hosts of phytoplasmas, insect vectors and
development of new techniques for phytoplasma detection. Also, the characterization of
phytoplasmas infecting established hosts allowed to give more information concerning
their epidemiology. Denmark

No phytoplasma or phytoplasma vectors were reported from Denmark. Finland

Phytoplasmas were detected in old reverted black currant plants and RFLP analysis
showed that they belonged to the aster yellows (AY) group (16Srl). In carrot infested
by Trioza apicalis Forster together with the bacterium ‘Candidatus Liberibacter
solanacearum, aster yellows phytoplasma (16SrI-A) was detected in 20% of samples
showing both leaf curling and discoloration, but no phytoplasma was detected in the
carrot psyllid samples. Results of a survey confirmed the presence of both psyllid vector species of ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma mali, Cacopsylla picta and C. melanoneura, in Finnish apple orchards. 23

Chapter 1

The number of individuals of both species varied but C. picta prevailed in both years. Reduction in numbers of C. melanoneura after the hard winter in 2010 was relatively
higher compared with that for C. picta. As C. melanoneura is considered to be a
newcomer in Finland, it may be present at its northernmost border. Occurrence of
“Ca. P. mali’ in C. picta was determined in samples collected from two localities, one in
which numerous imported apple varieties were planted and the other with local varieties
(Lemmetty e¢ a/., 2011). To verify the presence of ‘Ca. P. mali’ in apple trees, a survey
was conducted in 17 commercial apple orchards. Two samples tested positive and were
further analyzed for subtypes; they were shown to belong to apple proliferation subtype
AT-1 (Lemmetty ef a/., 2013). Lithuania

Studies on phytoplasma diseases in this country had at least a fifteen year history
allowing identification of several phytoplasmas in diverse plant species. Since 2009
a few new phytoplasma-associated diseases were reported. In diseased sour cherry
on the Neringa peninsula showing shoot proliferation and abnormally small leaves,
phytoplasmas classified in 16Srl (aster yellows), new subgroup 16SrI-Q were identified
(Valiunas e¢ a/., 2009). Onions plants grown for seed production in the Kaunas region
exhibited mild yellowing of leaves and stems, stunting, phyllody, and proliferation of
flowers. RFLP and sequence analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA, ribosomal protein,
and secY genes revealed the presence of phytoplasmas belonging to subgroups 16Srl-A
(rpI-A) and 16SrI-L (rpIB, secY-B). The results indicated that phytoplasma strains in
subgroup 16Srl-A (rpI-A) have the potential to infect onions in Europe and for the first
time demonstrated onion as a host for subgroup 16SrI-L. (Jomantiene et a/., 2010). In diseased plants of clover exhibiting symptoms of clover phyllody or of clover dwarf,
two distinct phytoplasmas were identified: clover phyllody-diseased plants were
infected by a subgroup 16SrI-C, while clover dwarf-diseased plants were infected by
16SrI-C and a phytoplasma classified in subgroup 16SrIII-B. These findings extend the
known geographic ranges of these subgroups. Phytoplasmas belonging to subgroups
16SrIII-P and 16SrI-C were identified in leafhoppers: strains belonging to subgroup
16SrI-C were found in Euscelis incisus and Macrosteles sexnotatus and strains belonging
to subgroup 16SrIII-P were detected in E. incisus (Vanauskas et al., 2011). These results
indicate that E. incisus and M. sexnotatus possibly act as vectors of strains classified in
subgroups 16SrI-C and 16SrIII-P, the latter subgroup containing phytoplasma strains
that have to date been found only in Lithuania. Norway

Apple production (AP) is an important disease in specific areas in both the western
and the eastern parts of the Country. AP is listed as quarantine disease and a survey in

24

the years 1996 and 1997 revealed 14 diseased trees in orchards throughout the country,
however no conclusive evidence for natural spread by vectors was found. The infected
trees at these locations were eradicated. From 2000 until 2008 only two or three more
infected trees were detected and eradicated. In 2010, however, some new serious cases
of AP disease were found in the western parts of the Country. A survey program for
orchards close to nurseries in the most important fruit districts was then started. During
autumn 2011 orchards were inspected and symptomatic plants sampled, in orchards
where no AP-like symptoms were found a random sampling was carried out. AP was
found in both symptomatic and asymptomatic trees. Any infected tree was found in
any of the surveyed nursery due to a strict use of healthy propagation material and good
control of potential vector populations (Blystad et al., 2012). References

Abstract

In Belgium and Netherlands phytoplasma diseases mainly affect fruit trees, while in
United Kingdom they are almost absent. Specific insect vectors were identified and strict

 

measures to climinate both pathogens and pests are actively implemented in Belgium and
in Netherlands. Key words: fruit trees, apple proliferation, pear decline, European stone fruit yellows, insect
vectors. Belgium

In 1981, apple proliferation (AP, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali; EPPO A2 list) was
discovered for the first time in Belgium. Until recently symptomatic trees had been
reported sporadically and found infected, but they were subsequently destroyed. In September 2009, two apple trees close to each other were sampled by the Federal
Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain in a nursery in the south-west of Belgium and
tested positive by PCR (Olivier et a/., 2010). Infected trees as well as adjacent trees have
been uprooted and burned to prevent disease spread. Symptoms of pear decline were
observed in the past in some orchards, but the presence of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
pyri’ (PD, EPPO A2 List) was never confirmed by molecular tests. In 2010 and 2011 a limited survey was carried out in a few commercial and non-
commercial orchards showed the presence of clear symptoms of witches’ broom (AP)
or early leaf discoloration (PD). Root and leaf samples were analysed by PCR and
results revealed the presence of both quarantine organisms (Peusens ef al., 2014). As
consequence an extensive and systematic survey was carried out by the Federal Agency
for the Safety of the Food Chain in 2011-2012 in 87 apple tree nurseries. Infected trees
were destroyed and eradication measures were imposed in the nurseries concerned. The

NPPO of Belgium is currently focusing its official inspections on the production of
propagation material and fruit trees. In 2004 an infection with European stone fruit
yellows was detected in a single plum tree in a private garden. Netherlands

Apple proliferation was detected for the first time in nursery trees in summer 1997. In
1998, it was found in a few orchards in the southern part of the Country. Strict measures
were taken in these orchards to prevent any further spread (NPPO, The Netherlands). From 1995 pear trees with symptoms of PD were found, the number was increasing
when grafted onto susceptible rootstocks, and since 2012 the NPPO declared this
disease to be present in all parts of the pear growing areas in the Country. United Kingdom

One single tree of British origin was found to be infected with AP in 1985, but no
additional infections were recorded since. In 1992 Parry’s disease was discovered to be
present in pear orchards, but no phytoplasma identification was reported. European
stone fruit yellows was detected in apricot at one location. Table 1. Overview of the current status of fruit tree phytoplasmas in Netherlands (NL) and in Belgium (8). , s Detection

Phytoplasma vectors

In Belgium the population dynamic of psyllid phytoplasma vectors was monitored in
several orchards, they were collected throughout the year, identified using a microscope
and tested for ‘Ca. P. mali’ presence. The following Cacopsylla sp. were present on
apple trees: C. mali, C. melanoneura and C. picta. Some orchards were surrounded by
hawthorn hedges and additional Cacopsylla species were found: C. peregrina, C. affinis
and C. crataegi. In pear the infection by pear sucker is a major problem together with
the production of honeydew by C. pyri. Another species, C. pyricola, was found but in a
small number. In Netherlands three psyllid species were identified: C. melanoneura, C.
pyriand C. pyricola. Table 2. Current status of vectors of fruit tree phytoplasmas in Netherlands (NL) and Belgium (B). Population Vector Collection Identification

Abstract

European stone fruit yellows is a long standing problem in apricot and peach orchards in
Moravia and East Bohemia, Czech Republic (CR), and in stone fruits in several regions
of Hungary and Poland. The study on ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’ infected apple trees
revealed the presence of strains in all the three countries. Epidemic occurrence of “stolbur” was
recorded in tomato, pepper and celery in South Moravia: vmp1 gene analyses revealed that
four genetic variants are infecting annual crops and wild plants in CR. Most of Hungarian
“seolbur” strains clustered in tuf-type b STAMP IL. Transmission of “stolbur” via potato tubers
and association of this phytoplasma with maize redness disease and its vector Reptalus panzeri
were investigated in Hungary. New plant hosts and potential insect vectors of phytoplasmas
belonging to different 16S ribosomal groups and subgroups were also identified in Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland. Key words: ‘Cu. P. asteris, “Ca. P. mali’, ‘Ca. P. pini; ‘Ca. P. prunorum, ‘Cz. P. solani’. Introduction

Phytoplasmas are bacteria lacking a cell wall and inhabiting the phloem of plants
and the hemolymph of insect vectors (Bertaccini e¢ a/., 2012). More than a thousand
phytoplasma-associated diseases causing high economic losses are known around the
world. Phytoplasmas affect many plant species including vegetables, fruit trees, conifers,
and ornamental plants. Severe devastation in crops, yield losses, decreasing of fruits
quality and death of plants is often the final result of these infections. There is no suitable
treatment against phytoplasma diseases and most of them are quarantine organisms
included in EPPO A2 list of pests. Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland as countries

29

located in Central Europe, are exposed to invasion of variable biotic factors including
phytoplasmas from both Western and Eastern Europe. We focused on detection and
characterization of phytoplasmas especially causing economically important losses in
these three countries. The aim of this study was also to summarize new plant hosts and
phytoplasma vectors reported since 2009. Czech Republic

“Candidiatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ is a long-standing problem. A survey was done
in apricot, peach and cherry orchards in Moravia and East Bohemia (Krika et a/., 2012;
Ludvikova et a/., 2011). Different methods of DNA extraction and PCR detection were
evaluated (Maskova et al., 2009), including comparison of symptom variability after
graft-inoculation in different Prunus spp. (Neéas et al,, 2012). Occurrence of ‘Ca. P.
pyri’ (PD), ‘Cz. P. mali (AP) and ‘Ca. P. asteris’ (16SrI-B and 16SrI-C subgroups) was
confirmed in orchards as well as in wild growing fruit trees. Extensive RFLP study of AP
revealed prevalence of P-I 16S-23S profile, rpX-A subgroup, subtypes AP-15 and AT-2
(Franové et al., 2013a). “Ca. P. solani’ (“stolbur”) was detected in many plant species and its epidemics have
been reported in tomato, pepper and celery in South Moravia (Navratil e al., 2009). Study of genetic variability of “stolbur” also by use of the polymorphic gene vmp 1 in
annual crops and wild plants revealed the presence of four genetic variants (Fialova et al.,
2009). Long term monitoring of “stolbur” vectors was done in intensive orchards and
overwintering sites. The first mass occurrence of Hyalesthes obsoletus in South Moravia
since 1950’ was observed in 2010 (Safitova et al, 2011). potential phytoplasma vector occurrence was done also in vineyards and surrounding
intensive vegetable plots: 136 hemipteran species were identified, 34 of them were
phytoplasma vectors and/or insect hosts. Together with the main “stolbur” phytoplasma
vector, H. obsoletus, the occurrence of the other vector Anaceratagallia ribauti with
50% of positive individuals was detected. Trifolium pratense (Franové et al., 2009) and
Chenopodium album (Safatova et al. 2011a) were found to be new hosts species for
“stolbur” phytoplasma that was also found to be associated with “bois noir” (BN) in
grapevine (Stary et al., 2013). Asparagus officinalis (Frénova and Petrzik, 2010) and Plantago lanceolata (Franova and
Simkova, 2009) were identified as hosts of ‘Ca. P. asteris’ (AY, 16SrI-B). A phytoplasma
belonging to 16SrI-C ribosomal subgroup was firstly reported in Echinacea purpurea
(Franova et al., 2009), Rhododendron hybridum (Ptibylova et al., 2013), Ribes rubrum
(Piibylova et al., 2011) and Apium graveolens (Frinova and Spak, 2013). Phytoplasmas
belonging to subgroup 16SrIII-B were identified in E. purpurea (Franova et al., 2013)
and Chenopodium album and phytoplasmas belonging to 16SrVI-A subgroup were

30

The phytoplasmas and phytoplasma vectors in COST FAOBO7 Countries

reported in Rhododendron hybridum (Piibylova et al., 2009). The finding of Ulmus
minor affected by elm yellows in Moravia represents the northernmost confirmed
occurrence of phytoplasma on elm trees within Europe (Navratil et a/., 2009). AP and PD were sporadically detected in C. picta (90 individuals tested/4 positive)
and C. pyri (966/11), C. pyrisuga (47/1), C. pyricola (17/1) in apple and pear orchards
in East Bohemia, respectively (Ludvikova et al, 2011a). Examination of hemipterans
in vineyards revealed the presence of phytoplasmas belonging to subgroups 16SrI-B,
16SrI-C, 16SrI-F, 16SrIII-B, 16SrXII-A, and unexpectedly, in Jassargus obtusivalvis of
phytoplasmas of the 16SrXIV group (Ors4gova et al., 2011). Hungary

National survey on grapevine yellows revealed the distribution of BN in all wine regions
of Hungary. Molecular characterisation of ‘Cz. P. solani’ proved the presence of different
genotypes all resulted in the tuf-type b. Most of the strains clustered in tuf-type b,
STAMP cluster II, while one isolate from tomato resulted affiliated to STAMP cluster
III. Grapevine strains from north-west Hungary clustered together in a monophyletic
branch of the STAMP tuf-type a genotype (Fabre et a/., 2011). ‘Transmission of “stolbur” phytoplasma via potato tubers was studied in a 3-year experiment. Tubers and their daughter plants (4 varieties of high starch content) were tested with PCR-
RFLP and real-time PCR analyses. In an average of three-years 83.8% and 0.5% of the
tubers and daughter plants, respectively resulted infected with “stolbur“ (Ember e¢ al.,
201 1a). A 2010 survey carried out to verify maize redness presence and its known vector
Reptalus panzeri in the maize production areas allow to detect the presence of ‘Ca. P. solani’
in symptomatic maize plants and of R. panzeri at one locality (Acs et al., 2011). The “flavescence dorée” (FD) vector Scaphoideus titanus, was found in the southern
counties in 2006 and its spreading to north is continuous. In order to evaluate the risk
represented by the wild reservoir as a source of FD outbreaks diverse wild perennial
plants in vineyards were tested in 2008-2011. Phytoplasmas belonging to group 16SrV
were detected by nested PCR/RFLP analyses in alders (86%) and in clematis (71%). Their characterisation on the map gene revealed that strains from both plants carried
the same map gene sequence as the FD strains. This survey has also detected the presence
of Oncopsis alni and Dictyophara europaea reported to be phytoplasma vectors (Ember
et al, 2011). In 2013 ED phytoplasmas were firstly detected in grapevine and in one S.
titanus sample collected in south-west Hungary (Kriston et a/., 2013). ‘Ca. P. pyri‘ the agent of pear decline was detected in C. pyri and C. pyricola and ‘Ca. P.
prunorum‘ agent of European stone fruit yellows as well identified in central region of
Hungary. Study on samples from 6 apple trees, originating from a small field destroyed
by AP, near the Austrian border revealed the presence of ‘Cz. P. mali’ with both P-I
and P-II 16S-23S profiles, belonging to AT-1, AT-2, AP subtypes and only to rpX-A
ribosomal subgroup (Paltrinieri et a/., 2010). 31

Poland

Epidemiological study revealed the predominant presence of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’
(16SrX-B) in stone fruit trees. Moreover, in single peach and sweet cherry trees ‘Ca. P.
mali’ (16SrX-A) and ‘Cz. P. pyri’ (16SrX-C) were respectively identified (Cieslitiska and
Morgas, 2011). Survey of apple orchards and several home gardens showed that apple
trees were mainly infected by ‘Ca. P. mali. Most of them were classified to subgroup
rpX-A, subtype AP. RFLP analysis of 165 rDNA plus 165-235 spacer region showed
two restriction profiles for the ‘Ca. P. mali’ isolates: P-I and P-IL. ‘Ca. P. asteris’ (AY,
16SrI-B) was also detected in several apple trees. PCR-RFLP analysis of 165 rRNA,
rpl22 and rpS3 as well as secY and tuf genes has not showed sequence diversity among
these ‘Ca. P. asteris’ strains. “Ca. P. mali’ was also identified in C. melanoneura and C.
picta, while ‘Ca. P. asteris’ was detected in a single batch of leafhoppers (Ciesliriska and
Kruczyriska, 2011; Cieslitiska er al., 2012). The presence of three phytoplasmas was demonstrated in 11 out of 13 tested coniferous
plant species; 9 are new natural host plants. ‘Cz. P. pini’ (16SrXX1), was detected in Abies
procera, Picea pungens, Pinus banksiana, P. mugo, P. nigra, P. sylvestris, P. tabuliformis
and Tsuga canadensis (Kamitiska et al., 2011). ‘Ca. P. pruni’ (16SrIII) was detected in
Picea abies and P. glauca, while ‘Ca. P. asteris’ in Picea pungens trees. Phytoplasmas were
detected in about 27% of the witches’ broom originated plants or showing pronounced
shoot proliferation symptoms as well as in some asymptomatic hybrid trees (Kamiriska
and Sliwa, 2010; Kamiriska and Berniak, 2011). AY was reported for the first time in plants belonging to Brassicaceae family showing
growth abnormalities: Brassica interspecific hybrids with green foliage and complete
flower bud failure, Brussels sprout with stunted growth, severe leaf malformation and
flower bud failure (Kaminska et a/., 2012), Chinese cabbage with abnormal flowers,
virescence and phyllody (Kamitiska et a/., 2012a). AY was also detected in oilseed rape
(Zwolitiska et al, 2011), European hazel with stunting and leaf yellows symptoms
(Cieslitiska and Kowalik, 2011) and Fraxinus excelsior showing ash yellows symptoms
(Kamiriska and Berniak, 2009). Oriental lily hybrids with leaf necrosis and flower
malformation symptoms were found to be infected by AY (16SrI-B) and AP (Kamiriska
and Sliwa, 2011). A phytoplasma closely related members of 16SrI-C subgroup was
detected in tomato plants in the western region of the country (Krawezyk et al., 2010). Pisum sativum with stunting, shoot proliferation and leaf chlorosis was found to be a
new “stolbur” phytoplasma host (Zwolitiska et a/., 2012). The natural occurrence of
phytoplasmas was firstly reported in Rubus spp. plants with stunting, short and thin
shoots. Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene showed that most of the strains clustered
together with the reference strain rubus stunt (RuS, ‘Cz. P. rubi, 16SrV-E), whereas the
strains from loganberry and wild blackberry were classified as X-disease (16SrIII) and
aster yellows groups, respectively (Cieslitiska, 2011). 32

Abstract

Germany and Switzerland are neighboring countries located in the middle of Europe. Both
countries have vineyards and orchards with differene fruit tree species in which various
incidences of phytoplasma diseases are present. Despite similar environmental conditions,
regional climatic and biogeographic particularities may influence the epidemiology and
ecology of a specific disease and of its vectors. During the COST action a survey based on
questionnaires was carried out asking members to report the distribution of phytoplasma
diseases and of their vectors in their countries. This chapter describes the current situation
in Germany and Switzerland, based on compiled information from questionnaire data during
these activities and on additional reports from national researchers. Key words: grapevine yellows, fruit tree phytoplasmas, leafhopper, psyllids, spread. Introduction

Phytoplasma diseases of fruit trees and grapevine are associated with several economic
important diseases all over Europe; some of them are also quarantine organisms. The
most widespread grapevine phytoplasmas are those of 16SrV-group causing “flavescence
dorée” (FD) and ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’ (group 16SrXII-A) associated with
“bois noir” (BN). Fruit tree phytoplasmas belong to the apple proliferation group
(16SrX-A), which includes ‘Ca. P. mali’, the agent of apple proliferation (AP), ‘Ca. P. prunorum,, associated with European stone fruit yellows (ESFY), and ‘Ca. P. pyri’
agent of pear decline (PD). While FD is transmitted by the leafhopper Scaphoideus
titanus and BN by the cixiid planthopper Hyalesthes obsoletus, all European fruit tree
phytoplasmas are transmitted by psyllids. Although cultivation practices and climatic
conditions can be quite heterogeneous in different regions, transmission by insects and
long-distance spread by infected planting material lead to a rapid diffusion of these
phytoplasmas among all European countries. In case of mobile vectors or endemic
plant reservoirs also isolated orchards and vineyards can be affected. For this reason,
updated knowledge on disease distribution as well as on the presence of insect vectors is

36

fundamental for a comprehensive pest risk assessment and cross-national phytosanitary
decisions. Phytoplasma diseases and vectors in Germany

Phytoplasma detection in plants and insects has been carried out by standard molecular
protocols using PCR-based assays. Psyllid identification was done using the key of
Ossiannilson (1992) and the electronic key www.psyllidkey.eu. Vector capacity has
been proven by transmission trials for H. obsoletus, Oncopsis alni, Cacopsylla picta and
C. pruni. The most spread grapevine-related phytoplasma disease is BN. It is present in 11 of the
13 viticultural regions of Germany. Two other locally distributed diseases on grapevine
are: the Palatinate grapevine yellows (PGY) associated with phytoplasmas of the elm
yellows group (16SrV-C) which is present in viticultural areas of Palatinate, Mosel
and Franken and another grapevine yellows associated with a phytoplasma of the aster
yellows group (16SrI) which was occasionally found in Palatinate and Mosel areas,
respectively (Ipach et a/., 2010). The cixiid planthopper H. obsoletus, the proven vector
for ‘Ca. P. solani’ to grapevine, has been found in all areas where the disease is present. It
is feeding on two major host plants, Convolvulus arvensis and Urtica dioica, which serve
also as natural reservoirs of the phytoplasma. Phytoplasmas associated with Palatinate
grapevine yellows colonize Alnus glutinosa and are only erratically transmitted from this
host to grapevine by the leafhopper O. alni. The vector(s) for the aster yellows-related
infections in grapevine are still unknown. The quarantine disease “flavescence dorée”
has not been found in Germany so far and also its vector, S. titanus, is not reported yet. Phytoplasma diseases and vectors in Switzerland

Phytoplasma detection in plants and insects has been carried out by visual monitoring
of symptoms as well as by molecular analyses. Psyllid identification was done using the
key of Ossiannilson (1992) and the electronic key www.psyllidkey.eu. Vector capacity
has not been proven by transmission trials in Switzerland and vector capacity for S.
titanus, H. obsoletus, C. mali, C. pruni and C. pyri is therefore presumed from studies
and trials carried out abroad. Both important diseases on grapevine, BN and FD are present. While ‘Ca. P. solani’ and
its vector H. obsoletus are widespread all over the country (Kehrli er a/., 2010; 2011), the
agent of FD has so far only been found in the Ticino region. However its vector, the
leafhopper S. titanus, has not only been reported in the canton Ticino, but also in the
cantons Vaud, Geneva and Valais. Pear decline is widespread in Switzerland (Biinter and Schaerer, 2012), whereas apple
proliferation is restricted to Northwestern Switzerland, mainly to the cantons Aargau
and Solothurn (Biinter and Schaerer, 2012). European stone fruit yellows is only reported

37

Chapter 1

from some local stone fruit growing regions, mostly in the canton Valais, where its vector,
C. pruni, is also present. In the canton Valais, two populations A and B, belonging to
the C. pruni complex, coexist (Peccoud et a/., 2013) and both were shown to carry ‘Ca. P. prunorum, the ESFY agent. Mostly breeding and feeding on wild Prunus species,
C. pruni quite likely also lives in cultivated Prunus species such as apricots. Moreover,
current observations indicate that ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ is more widespread than expected
since symptoms on other Prunus spp. such as P. persica or P. domestica are difficult to
identify. The phytoplasma presence was also confirmed in nurseries outside of the canton
Valais. The acknowledged vector C. picta is present in the cantons Aargau and Solothurn,
but has only found being infected with ‘Cz. P. mali’ in the canton Aargau (Jarausch et
al. 2011). No information is so far available concerning the presence or infection rate
of putative vectors of ‘Cz. P. pyri. The rubus stunt phytoplasma has occasionally been
reported from local blackberry and raspberry cultivations. Potato “stolbur’ is also found,
but rarely, although its vector, H. obsoletus, is widespread. Table 1, Summary of disease incidence, phytoplasma agents and vector status in Germany.

Abstract

Phytoplasma diseases mainly affect the French viticulture, stone fruit and lavender production. Recent studies have pointed out the impact of wild plants as a source of infection or as
reservoir for insect vectors. Two strains of “flavescence dorée” (FD) phytoplasmas are present
in French FD outbreaks, surrounding wild Vitis regrowth and infected alders may constitute
potential epidemic reservoirs. It was experimentally shown that cold winter temperature has
an effect on egg-hatching dynamics in Scaphoideus titanus but also on operational sex-ratio
and that S. titanus nymphs do not use vibrational communication to aggregate on plant. A
draft sequence of the FD phytoplasma was produced and used to improve the taxonomy of the
group 16SrV and to serve for the search of genetic determinants involved in the phytoplasma
adaptation to insect vectors. “Bois noir” is endemic in French vineyards and ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma solani’ strains detected belong to the stamp cluster IA and IV. ’Ca. P. solani’
is endangering lavender production as specific strains are rapidely propagated by Hyalesthes
obsoletus populations living on lavender. Two cryptic species corresponding to Cacopsylla
pruni are present in France as vector of European stone fruit yellows. Key words: “flavescence dorée”, “bois noir” lavender decline, Scaphoideus titanus, Cacopsylla pruni. Strains of “flavescence dorée” phytoplasmas

‘Two strains of “flavescence dorée” (FD) phytoplasmas are present in French outbreaks
where surrounding wild Vitis regrowth and infected alders may constitute potential
epidemic reservoirs. FD is epidemically transmitted by the grapevine leafhopper
Scaphoideus titanus, an insect of North American origin now widely distributed in
the vineyards of Southern France and also present in Burgundy, Jura, Champagne and
Loire valley. The S. titanus populations were shown to have been introduced from the
USA and therefore low genetic diversity is encountered (Papura et al., 2009; 2012). Grapevine yellows are surveyed using a reference diagnosis method consisting of a
Taqman triplex real-time PCR for FD and BN phytoplasmas as well as a Vitis vinifera
endogenous control (Pelletier er a/., 2009). The sequencing or the restriction map of the gene map allows to differentiate genetic
clusters: the one named mapFD2 is clonal and represent 85% of the disease cases, whereas
the cluster mapFD1 only represents 15% of the FD cases and is mainly detected in South-
Western France (Salar et a/., 2009). These two strains were isolated and transmitted to
broad bean in which there are experimentally maintained using Euscelidius variegatus. Experiments in controlled conditions showed that both strains multiply with the same
kinetics in plant, so they should have the same epidemiological properties. The prevalence

4l

Chapter 1

of the strain mapFD2 in France may have resulted from an increased propagation from
nurseries (Salar et a/., 2013). Despite the control measures such as the pulling out of
the infected grapes and the spread of insecticide, the disease is difficult to control due
to the large viticulture areas involved. In order to use less insecticide, some growers
organizations decided to improve the disease management by monitoring the insect
vector populations and extensively surveying the vineyards for disease symptoms. Alders were randomly sampled in France. So called alder yellows phytoplasmas
(AldY) were detected in more than 85% of the alder trees. Most of the AldY map gene
sequences showed some diversity, but formed a monophyletic cluster with other map
gene sequences of FD, AIdY and Palatinate grapevine yellows (PGY) strains. The map
gene sequence of some AldY strains was found identical to the one of French mapFD1
type strains, while other AldY phytoplasmas clearly classified in the mapFD2 cluster. In
South-western France, along rivers, uncontrolled rootstock regrowths have shown to
constitute in many places a reservoir for FD phytoplasmas and S. titanus populations
escaping the insecticide treatments. Genomics, taxonomy and adaptation to insect vectors in FD phytoplasmas

The 670 kbp chromosome of “flavescence dorée” phytoplasma line FD92 was partially
sequenced by pyrosequencing and SOLEXA. More than 94% of the chromosome
could be assembled and the 22 largest contigs representing 85% of the chromosome
were annotated. Out of 464 chromosomal coding sequences (CDS), 174 CDS (38%)
were involved in information transfer (DNA replication, protein production, RNA
modification and regulation), 88 CDS (19%) were encoding metabolic enzymes,
40 CDS (9%) corresponded to transporters, 8 CDS (1%) corresponded to cellular
processes, whereas 145 CDS (31%) remained cryptic. At this stage of incomplete
assembly, repeated sequences were underestimated and transposon and phage-related
CDS (2%) could not yet be precisely evaluated. FD92 phytoplasma possesses a complete
glycolytic pathway and has a prominent system for proteolysis, possibly resulting from
the adaptation to its woody hosts. It was shown upon sequencing of 5 chromosomal regions in a broad collection of
phytoplasmas, that phytoplasmas belonging to the taxonomic subgroup 16SrV-C
and —D corresponding to FD phytoplasmas, alder yellows phytoplasmas, Palatinate
grapevine yellows detected in Germany and France and Clematis phytoplasmas detected
in Italy may constitute a common genomic species. It was also the case for strains of
rubus stunt that could also be differentiated at the 16SrDNA level, supporting therefore
their description as ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma rubi’ (Malembic-Maher et a/., 2011). Some alder yellows phytoplasmas detected on grapevine in France and in Germany as
isolated cases could be transmitted to the broad bean Vicia faba. None of them could
be experimentally transmitted from this host by S. titanus, on the contrary of mapFD1
and map-FD2 strains of FD. In order to identify genetic determinants responsible for

42

the adaptation of FD phytoplasmas to the S. titanus insect vector; the draft genome of
the epidemic strain FD92 was searched for genes encoding surface proteins with high
genetic diversity. Vmap genes which encode surface proteins VMP-A and VMP-B display
low homology to the Mycoplasma agalactiae variable lipoprotein VPMA. VMP possess a
putative signal peptide, large repeated domains of about 80 amino acids and a C-terminal
transmembrane alpha helix. Such organization in repeated domains was reminiscent of
surface proteins of Gram positive bacteria involved in the invasion of eukaryotic cells. Vinp genes were sequenced among a representative set of 16SrV phytoplasma strains. VmpA and vmpB sequences both formed 3 phylogenetic clusters, out of which the
cluster II and III corresponded to strains epidemically propagated by S. titanus. As
previously reported for the ‘Ca. P. solani’ vmp1 (Cimerman et al., 2009), vmpB genes
were shown to be submitted to positive selection pressure. Phylogenetic analysis of the
repeated domains indicated that VMP of cluster II and III quickly varies by duplication
of the repeated domains. The hydrophilic central part of FD92 VMPs was cloned in
pET28 expression vector in E. coli in fusion with a polyhistidine tag and purified. Anti-
VMP polyclonal antisera detected the expression of VMPs in plant and insect. VMP-A
was shown to interact in farwestern-blot assays with two proteins of 55 kDa and 120
kDa of the experimental vector E. variegatus and the natural vector S. titanus. VMPs
represent valuable markers for studying the adaptation of FD phytoplasma to S. titanus
insect vector and its sequence should be a useful tool for risk assessment of epidemics in
the vineyard (Desqué ef al, 2013). Biology and behavior of S. titanus

In agreement with the Northern American origin of the FD vector, it was experimentally
demonstrated by submitting eggs from a natural population to temperature variations
that the majority of hatchings occurred more quickly in cold rather than in mild winter
simulated conditions (Chuche and Thiery, 2009). The authors have also examined how
simulated fluctuating temperatures affect the operational sex ratio of hatching as well as
nymph and adult fitness (body size, weight, and developmental rate) in this leafhopper. Female eggs were more sensitive to temperature variation. There was a weaker excess of males
after incubation under warm conditions. Nymph instars that hatched from eggs exposed
to warm temperature were larger and bigger that those exposed to cold temperature, but
developmental rate of the two populations was not affected (Chuche and Thiery, 2012). Nymphs of S. sitanus have an aggregating behavior on grapevine that could result
from communication among them. Although the use of substrate-borne vibrations
to communicate is well known in adult leafhoppers, this behavior had not been so far
investigated for nymphs. It was shown that nymphs of S. sitanus do not use species-specific
vibrations neither for intra- nor interspecific communication and also did not produce alarm
vibrations when facing potential predators. It was therefore concluded that their aggregative
behavior is independent from a vibrational communication (Chuche et a, 2011). 43

“Bois noir” and lavender decline phytoplasma genetic diversity and epidemiology
The “bois noir” (BN) disease associated with the presence of ‘Ca, P. solani’ is endemic in
France. The phytoplasma is transmitted by Hyalesthes obsoletus, a planthopper residing in
weeds such as bindweeds (Convolvulus arvensis) and stinging nettles (Urtica dioica) which
also act as plant reservoirs. “Cz. P. solani’ is affecting solanaceous crop such as tomato,
tobacco, eggplant, pepper but also sugar beet and small fruit production such as strawberry. To follow phytoplasma strains distribution and spread genotyping tools are used, mainly
sequencing secY and stamp genes as well as vp] sequencing or RFLP (Cimerman et al.,
2009; Pacifico et al, 2009). In France, in all BN cases $1, $4 and S6 secY genotypes are
present in almost equal proportion according to a survey conducted in 2004. Most of
these cases corresponded to V1 and V4 vmp1-RELP patterns (Pacifico er al., 2009). A gene encoding a variable surface protein of ‘Ca. P. solani’ was recently isolated and
used for strain genotyping (Fabre ef a/., 2011; 201 1a). Stamp gene sequencing allowed
to differentiate 56 different genotypes in the Euro-Mediterranean basin. Phylogenetic
analysis showed the existence of four main stamp genetic clusters. French strains belong to
genetic clusters tuf-type b-stamp IA corresponding to strains from bindweed in western
Europe and tuf-type a-stamp IV corresponding to strains propagated from U. dioica. The most important damages are caused to lavender fields where H. obsoletus are
proliferating. Lavender decline is associated with several genetic variants of ‘Cz. P. solani’
(Danet ef a/., 2010), its incidence was surveyed in twenty seven lavender fields in South
East France from 2008 to 2010 and declining plants were collected and submitted to a
“Ca. P. solani’ specific Taqman real-time PCR assay at spring and autumn. The incidence
of lavender decline increased over seasons in most of the fields surveyed. The presence
of the phytoplasma was revealed in 19% to 56% of the plants according to seasons and
cultivars and its prevalence was correlated with symptom severity. Better detection of
the pathogen was obtained in autumn than in spring. In autumn ‘Cz. P. solani’ was
detected in 56% of the declining Lavandula angustifolia but only in 39% of the declining
L. angustifolia x L. latifolia hybrids. Genotyping of the ‘Ca. P. solani’ strains detected
showed thar fifteen different secY genotypes were associated with the disease. Fields were
infected by 3 to 7 different ‘Ca. P. solani’ strains. Three strains of genotypes $17, $16 and
S14 were prevalently detected in most fields and prevalence of the $17 strain increased
during the survey to reach 75% in 2010. The ‘Ca. P. solani’ strains detected in wild plants
surrounding lavender fields were mainly of $1 and $4 genotypes, indicating that the
main reservoir of the disease were lavender themselves instead of weeds as it is usually
the case for other diseases associated with “Cu. P. solani’ presence. H. obsoletus could be
commonly captured in lavender fields and was shown to mainly harbour the $17, $16
and S14 genotypes. The strain $17 could be insect-transmitted to Catharanthus roseus. ‘Two independent cases of ‘Ca. P. trifolii’ infection could also be evidenced on lavender
and lavender hybrid (O. Sémétey ef al, unpublished data). In the past years, susceptible and tolerant lavenders (L. angustifolia) or Lavandula
hybrids were proposed as disease management strategy to growers. However, the bases

44

for tolerance are unknown. The titers of ‘Cz. P. solani’ in the leaves and shoots of different
lavenders and hybrids, either sensitive or tolerant was determined by quantitative PCR
and symptom severity resulted to be not correlated to the tolerance status of all cultivars
tested, nor to the phytoplasma titer (Gaudin et a/., 2011). It is suspected that tolerance
to decline may be related to a lower susceptibility to the insect vector. European stone fruit yellows and its psyllid vectors

‘Ca. P. prunorum’ induces economic damages essentially to apricot and Japanese plum
production. It was shown that Cacopsylla pruni present in France as vector of European
stone fruit yellows have overwintering and latency stage on conifers (Thebaud et al,
2009). Using microsatellite markers (Sauvion et. ad, 2009), this psyllid was discovered to
encompass two highly divergent genetic groups that are morphologically similar (Sauvion
et al, 2007). ITS2 sequences recently showed that the two genetic groups also are highly
divergent in this sequence. A specific ITS2 PCR test was designed for the assignment of
individuals to either genetic group based on amplicon size. Because none of the previously
assigned individuals appeared heterozygous at the ITS2 locus it was inferred that the
genetic groups of C. pruni, whose distribution is partly sympatric, constitute biological
species that have not recently exchanged genes (Peccoud et al., 2013). Eleven different genotypes of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ have been detected so far in France out
of the 34 detected, based on the sequencing of four house-keeping genes namely aceF,
pnp, secY and imp (Danet et al., 2011). ‘Ca. P. pyri’ and ‘Ca. P. mali’ are present but do
not cause important losses to the pome fruit production. References

Abstract

“Bois noir” phytoplasma is present in the vineyards of all three countries, as well as its
well known vector Hyalestes obsoletus. “Flavescence dorée” phytoplasma was detected in
Slovenia first, and in Austria and Croatia within the timeframe of this COST Action. Molecular epidemiology and diversity investigations confirmed considerable diversity of
both phytoplasmas. Besides the expected epidemiologic cycles, interesting and potentially
new pathosystem niches have been investigated. The presence of the three most important
fruit tree phytoplasmas, the agents of European stone fruit yellows, pear decline and apple
proliferation, and of their vectors was detected in all three countries. Novel phytoplasma
detection and research methods are being used, and innovative management strategies are
developed. Key words: “bois noit”, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’ “flavescence dorée’, ‘Ca. P. pyri ‘Ca. P. prunorum; ‘Ca. P. pini’ epidemiology, vectors. Introduction

The phytoplasma research in Austria, Croatia and Slovenia has some common features
probably due to the geographic proximity, cultural links and overlaps in agricultural
practices. The focus is on grapevine and fruit tree phytoplasma infection problems, and
constant improvements in relevant diagnostic approaches. This overview summarizes
the main achievements in phytoplasma and vector research from 2009 onwards entailing
the reader’s familiarity with the previous publications. The data were gathered from the
published papers and conference contributions available to the authors for the years
2009-2013. Austria

“Bois noir” (BN) associated with the presence of “stolbur” phytoplasmas (‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma solani’) is presently widespread in all vine growing regions of Austria. Surprisingly current investigations show that BN epidemiology has changed dramatically
within a few years. Investigations between 2003 and 2008 frequently ascertained the

47

Chapter 1

presence of tuf-type b “stolbur” phytoplasmas in Convolvulus arvensis and grapevines,
whereas infections of Urtica dioica were not common. Hyalestes obsoletus was rare
or not detectable except in Styria. The search for alternative vectors proved that the
Agalliinae leafhopper Anaceratagallia ribauti is able to transmit ‘Ca. P. solani’ to Vicia
faba and Catharanthus roseus under experimental conditions (Riedle-Bauer et al.,
2008; Sara and Riedle-Bauer, 2009; Brader et al., 2014). Since 2012, in contrast, mass
occurrences of H. obsoletus on U. dioica were ascertained in all vine growing provinces
of Austria. ‘Cz. P. solani’ tuf-type b was frequently detected in U. dioica but rarely in
C. arvensis. For a better analysis of epidemiological cycles vmp1, stamp and secY gene
analyses were included in the study. The results allowed the conclusion that presently
the main epidemiogical cycle of ‘Cz. P. solani’ in Austria includes H. obsoletus as insect
vector and U. dioica as weed phytoplasma source. The prevalent phytoplasma genotype
shows a tuftype b restriction pattern, a ufB gene sequence intermediate between tuf-
type a and -b and secY, stamp and vmp1 genes of nettle associated strains (Brader et al.,
2014). Systematic field investigations to manage BN demonstrated high recovery rates
of diseased vines after pollarding. In addition statistical analysis linked recovery rates to
grapevine cultivar and plant age (Riedle-Bauer et a/., 2009). Scaphoideus titanus, the vector of “flavescence dorée” (FD) was detected in southeast
Styria in 2004. Since then, the insect has spread and is now present in parts of south
and southeast Styria and Burgenland (Zeisner, 2008; AGES, 2013). First outbreaks
of FD were recorded in 2009 in southeast Styria. Later a second focus in south Styria
was identified. The phytoplasma was identified on local Vitis vinifera cultivars, on an
American hybrid, as well as on Clematis vitalba. Mixed infections of ‘Ca. P. solani’ and
FD phytoplasmas were also recorded (Reisenzein and Steffek, 2011). As a consequence
models aiming to simulate the current and the potential future distribution of FD and
its vector S. titanus were developed. The models permitted the simulation of temporal
and spatial dynamics with consideration of potential global warming and different
management strategies. In addition, economic impact analyses allowed the evaluation
of different intervention and abatement strategies and the estimation of the potential
economic impact on Austrian viticulture (Steffek er a/., 2011; Strauss et al., 2012). During the last decade losses of apricot and pear trees due to European stone fruit
yellows (ESFY) and pear decline (PD) have become a major concern. Surveys on the
occurrence and distribution of psyllids in pome and stone fruit orchards revealed the
presence of Cacopsylla pruni, C. pyricola, C. pyri, C. pyrisuga, C. melanoneura and C.
picta. Phytoplasmas were occasionally ascertained in C. pruni, investigations in several
pear orchards revealed infection rates of pear psyllids (C. pyricola, C. pyri and C.
pyrisuga) between 3 and 8%. No phytoplasma presence was observed in C. melanoneura
and C. picta (Lethmayer et al., 2011, C. Lethmayer, pers. comm.). Within the frame
of an EFSA project the current distribution of ‘Cz. P. prunorum’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri’
was reviewed (Steffek et a, 201 1a; 2012). Based on this work different management
options to review the phytosanitary status of these pests in the EU were elaborated. 48

The phytoplasmas and phytoplasma vectors in COST FAOBO7 Countries

Presence and temporal dynamics of C. pruni on Prunus armeniaca, P. domestica, PR
spinosa and P. cerasifera Nigra; as well as phytoplasma infection rates of C. pruni and
Prunus spp. were studied in detail from 2011 till 2013. C. pruni adults were observed
on Prunus spp. from calendar week 10 to 12 till the end of June. Zero to 11.5% of the
remigrant insects and 0-3.44% of the springtime generation insects, as well as 9.8% to
63.3% of the apricot samples, 20 to 40% of the plum samples and single blackthorn
samples were infected (Maier ef a/., 2013). The transmission of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ during
the propagation process was tracked by grafting infected scions on certified apricot
seedling rootstocks. Whip grafting in winter resulted in significantly lower infection
rates (0-15%) than budding in summer (46 to 88%) (Riedle-Bauer ef a/., 2012). Effects
of kaolin, paraffin, orange and fennel oils on survival and feeding of C. pruni were tested
under laboratory conditions (Riedle-Bauer ef a/., 2011). Molecular characterization of
ESFY and PD strains was carried out by analysis of imp, aceF and hfIB genes (Paleskié
et al, 2013). Movement of overwintered adults in a model apricot orchard was tracked by aid of a
mark and recapture study. The experiments allowed monitoring of insect spread and
estimation of insect numbers in an orchard. The method might be helpful for the
development of insect vector management strategies (Riedle-Bauer et a/., 2014). Croatia

The BN phytoplasma impact on the vine growing is still the largest among phytoplasma
detected in Croatian vineyards. Correspondingly, BN molecular epidemiology and
diversity are the most investigated topics. Multigene sequence analysis including
housekeeping genes tufB, secY and BN-specific genes vmp1 and stamp resulted in
finding BN large molecular diversity. About 20 genotypes were found in grapevines, C.
arvensis and H. obsoletus samples from various geographic locations. Closed H. obsoletus-
bindweed-grapevine pathosystems have been found, but different pathosystems at some
locations were also present (Seruga Musié e¢ a/., 2011; 2012; 2013). Parallel investigations of BN pathosystems in the vine growing regions on both sides of
the Croatian-Hungarian border were performed and insect diversity was found in the
eastern regions, but H. obsoletus was the most widespread BN vector along the whole
border. Also, the prevalence of BN tuf-type b and C. arvensis pathosystems was shown
with some interesting niches containing pathosystems potentially dominated by U.
dioica and tuf-type a of BN (Skorié er a/., 2011). The first FD foci in Croatia were recorded in 2009-2010 (Seruga Musié ef a/., 2011a)
in both commercially well-known and indigenous grapevine varieties (Skorié et al.,
2011a; Seruga Musié ef al., 2012). Besides initially recorded foci west and southwest
of Zagreb, two new locations with diseased vines east and southeast of the capital were
reported demonstrating the FD-zone widening (Skori¢ et a/., 2011a). Subsequent FD
studies resulted in FD presence confirmation in C. vitalba and S. titanus, and molecular

49

Chapter 1

characterization demonstrated the circulation of FD1 and FD3 strains at different
locations (Seruga Musié e¢ a/., 2012). Even though symptoms of stone and pome fruit phytoplasmas were observed in the
country long ago, the molecular characterization of pathogens and the vector survey
are more recent (Krizanac et al., 2010). ‘Ca. P. pyri’ and ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ are the most
widespread and have the highest incidence in pears and several stone fruit species,
respectively. C. pruni has been implicated in the ESFY transmission, whilst C. pyri and
C. pyrisuga were found positive for PD. Molecular diversity of fruit tree phytoplasmas
was richer than expected as was confirmed by multigene sequence analysis of some
local strains (Danet ef a/., 2011). Interestingly, BN was found in pears as often as
PD. Moreover, some C. pyrisuga samples also harboured “stolbur” phytoplasmas. The
epidemiological significance of these findings is still unresolved. The finding of C.
melanoneura and C. picta preceded the molecular identification of AP. “Ca. P. asteris’ (aster yellows phytoplasma, AY) is well known for its global and species
wide distribution. Besides an ongoing investigation of AY in Lombardy poplars, a
phytoplasma closely related to 16SrI-B, whose characterization is in progress, was
detected in oilseed rape (Skorié e¢ a/., 2012) in mixed infection with Turnip mosaic
virus. AY was also sporadically detected in grapevines, S. titanus, fruit trees (pear, peach,
Japanese plum) and C. pyri vectors (Krizanac et al., 2010). A phytoplasma, known to infect conifer species ‘Cz. P. pini’, was detected in Croatia for
the first time in 2011 (Jedi¢ et al, 2012). One Pinus mugo and several P halepensis trees
in north western continental and coastal habitats respectively, were found infected by
this phytoplasma (Jezi¢ e¢ a/., 2013). Slovenia

The Slovenian phytoplasma research in the last five years has been marked by the
efforts to understand the grapevine interactions with phytoplasmas via biochemistry,
genomic and transcriptomic approaches, including the application of bioinformatic and
statistical tools (Hren et al., 2009; Prezelj et al., 2013; Rotter et al., 2013). In addition,
several new detection protocols like real-time PCR and loop-mediated isothermal
amplification have been introduced in phytoplasma diagnostics (Nikoli¢ er a/., 2010;
VITISENS FP7 project report). The vineyard infections with BN are very common and besides the main BN vector H.
obsoletus, Euscelis incisus, S. titanus, Reptalus cuspidatus and R. panzeri also harbour BN
(Mehle e¢ al. 2011), apparently without major epidemiologic significance. Although
FD has been detected in grapevine and C. vitalba plants since 2005 (Mehle er a/., 2011),
in the last years its rapid spread from south west to north east was observed. Therefore,
a great effort was made in development of new diagnostic protocols which would
allow easier and early detection of this phytoplasma (Prezelj e¢ a/., 2013; VITISENS
FP7 project report). To investigate genetic diversity of this phytoplasma in Slovenia a

50

The phytoplasmas and phytoplasma vectors in COST FAOBO7 Countries

wide analysis of strains from known and possible hosts and vectors was performed. The
genotyping has revealed the occurrence of FD strains similar to FD70, and belonging
to subgroups FD-D and FD-C. Among them, FD-D isolates prevailed in grapevine,
and only FD-C strains were detected in symptomatic as well as asymptomatic Clematis
plants (Mehle et a/., 2011a). Alders (Alnus glutinosa and A. incana) and the insect
Oncopsis alni were found to host phytoplasmas with sequence similarities to three FD
clusters, as well as those similar to other alder yellows strains (Mehle e¢ a/., 2011; 201 1a). In some alder samples mixed phytoplasma infections with different combinations were
also demonstrated. Besides S. titans, harbouring FD (Mehle er a/., 2011; 2011a),
the mosaic leafhopper Orientus ishidae was found infected with FD, increasing the
complexity of the FD pathosystems (Mehle ef a/., 2010). With the exception of symptomatic Echinacea purpurea plants (Radisck et al., 2009),
“Ca. P. asteris’ has not been detected in the country. However, a new real-time PCR
assay using TaqMan minor groove binder probes for its detection was developed (Hren
et al. 2010). The presence of AP, PD and ESFY is long time known, as well as the wide distribution
of their common vectors, and does not differ from the usual scenarios. Besides in apple,
AP was detected in cherry, apricot and European plum. ESFY was detected in C. pruni,
PD in C. pyri and C. pyricola (Mehle et al.,2011). References

Abstract

These countries showed increasing interest in phytoplasma research. Detection and
identification of phytoplasmas and/or some of their insect vectors in fruit trees and grapevine
was achieved. Deep study on multigene differentitation of aster yellows and “stolbur’-
related phytoplasmas were also performed and diversity of some of the detected strains was
demonstrated. Key words: grapevine, fruit trees, aster yellows, “bois noir’, “flavescence dorée”, insect vectors. Introduction

Phytoplasma associated diseases are long-time known and described in these countries,
however only recently specific researches were founded and carried out in order to
identify the phytoplasmas present in the majority of agricultural relevant crops. The
availability of molecular tools together with the expertise gained also through the
Action allow to start the management of these diseases in the best way, after discovering
of phytoplasma presence and also vector related to several of the diverse phytoplasmas
studied. In all five Countries the presence of “bois noir” associated mainly to “stolbur”
tuf-type b phytoplasmas was reported, as well as the widespread presence of corn
reddening associated with molecularly undistinguishable “stolbur” phytoplasmas. Wide
presence of apple proliferation and European stone fruit yellows or pear decline is also
a quite common feature in the majority of these Countries. A number of insect vector
was also reported and studied mainly in Serbia and Bulgaria. Bosnia and Herzegovina

The phytoplasma associated diseases detection in Bosnia and Herzegovina was greatly
increased trough the action as well as the research on potential insect vectors. Main
research was carried out on phytoplasmas infecting grapevine, and it was mainly related
with “bois noir” strain characterization, however considering the presence in southern
districts of Scaphoideus titanus (Delié et al., 2007) extensive monitoring were also
performed. Presence and diffusion of grapevine yellows phytoplasmas was investigated
in 2008 and 2010 in twelve vineyards located in two viticultural areas of Srpska where
samples from different cultivars and weeds were collected for molecular analyses together

with some potential insect vectors. Phytoplasmas belonging to 16SrXII-A group were
confirmed to be associated with grapevine yellows, while in a Clematis vitalba sample a
phytoplasma belonging to 16SrV-C subgroup was identified. RFLP analysis of the tuf
gene indicated the presence of the tuf-type b of “stolbur” phytoplasmas. Dictyophara
europaea and Reptalus cuspidatus were identified but molecular analyses did not show
phytoplasma presence in the tested insect samples (Deli¢ er a/., 2011). Bulgaria

Rubus fruticosus in the region of Plovdiv showing severe stunting and bushy aspect
resulted infected with a “stolbur” phytoplasma belonging to tuf-type b (Bobev eg al.,
2013). The same phytoplasma was reported in Convolvulus arvensis and Prunus avium
(Avramov ef al., 2011). Epidemiological studies on “bois noir” presence as well as on
insect vectors indicate the presence of Hyalesthes obosoletus and Reptalus spp. infected
with “stolbur”. The presence of “flavescence dorée” vector S. titanus was also reported
(Avramov ef a/., 201 1a). In fruit trees all three main phytoplasmas belonging to the
apple proliferation group were identified. The spread and the frequency of individuals
from the psyllid genus Cacopsylla in four fruit tree orchards located in three different
regions indicated that all psyllid species described as vectors of fruit tree phytoplasmas
were present. Cacopsylla pruni specimens from two different regions were carrying
“Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum (Etropolska et a/., 2011). FYR Macedonia
In this Country research was carried out on grapevine yellows presence and spreading

in 13 locations of seven regions and “bois noir” tuf-type b was always identified (Mitrev
etal. 2011). Romania

“Stolbur” phytoplasmas were detected in several crops such as potato, tomato, pepper,
eggplant and beet (Beta vulgaris); they were also detected in weeds, particularly C.
arvensis, Cuscuta sp., and Euphorbia falcata. All infected samples had the same RFLP
profile corresponding to the tuf-type b. “Stolbur”-affected potato plants produced a
large number of spongy tubers that resulted in commercially unacceptable potato chips
upon processing (Ember et al., 2011). Apple proliferation and pear decline were also detected respectively in apple and pear. Serbia
Phytoplasmas studied in Serbia enclose “stolbur” (Pavlovié et a/., 2011; 2012; Mitrovié
et al, 2013), European stone fruit yellows, pear decline, aster yellows, 16SrI-E,

16SrIII-B, bermudagrass white leaf, ‘Ca. P. ulmi’, “Ca. P. rhamni. The newly described
“Ca. P. convolvuli’ was also reported in bindweed together with “stolbur” phytoplasmas
(Martini et a/., 2012). Strains of phytoplasmas were also detected by multigene approach
in “flavescence dorée” and apple proliferation samples from Serbia (Bertaccini et al.,
2009; Paltrinieri et al., 2010; 2011; 2012). Epidemiological studies on “stolbur” and
aster yellows insect vectors have been conducted (Jovié et al., 2009; Drobnjakovié
et al., 2010). A new marker, groEL gene, has been developed and used for analyses
of some of the examined phytoplasmas (Mitrovié ef a/., 2011). Transmission trials
carried out with a H. obsoletus population collected on nettle near a corn field allow the
verification of the cixiid ability to transmit the corn reddening disease. Amplification of
phytoplasma DNA was obtained after nested PCR assays from corn samples tested after
40 days from insect caging and from batches of H. obsoletus collected on nettle from
the same population used for cage-transmission. RFLP analyses allow identification of
the detected phytoplasmas as “stolbur” in both, corn experimentally infected and H.
obsoletus specimens from the population used for transmission (Mori et a/., 2013). References

Abstract

Phytoplasmas detected in Spain and Portugal are associated with relevant diseases in grapevine
and fruit trees for which also main insect vectors were identified. Malta carried out small
surveys only on grapevine phytoplasmas that resulted not present. Other phytoplasmas such
as aster yellows, “stolbur’, 16SrIII, 16SrVI and ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pini’ were detected

in horticultural crops and/or in forest or urban trees. Key words: grapevine, fruit trees, aster yellows, “bois noir’, “flavescence dorée”. Introduction

Phytoplasma associated diseases are of relevant importance in southern European
countries such as Spain and Portugal and during the Action extensive surveys allow
to verify the presence of a number of them in diverse plant species of agricultural and
environmental relevance. For the majority of phytoplasmas or phytoplasma groups
detected insect vectors were also identified, facilitating their management after knowing
their epidemiological spreading features. Phytoplasmas and insect vectors involved in grapevine yellows diseases

Two diseases in cultivated grapevines, “flavescence dorée” (FD) and “bois noir”
(BN), have been reported in Spain and Portugal. FD is the most aggressive disease
but the symptoms of both are similar and mainly involve plant decline, desiccation
of inflorescences, withering of clusters, irregular maturation of the wood, leaf rolling,
vein banding, leaf yellowing on white variety and leaf reddening on red variety. The
most spread disease in Spain is BN, it is present in different vine growing regions

58

The phytoplasmas and phytoplasma vectors in COST FAOBO7 Countries

such as “La Rioja’, Alava, Navarre, Catalonia and Aragon. The first outbreak of FD
in Spain was in 1996 in the French border of northeast of Catalonia and by now the
disease is eradicated. FD is the most dangerous disease associated with phytoplasma
presence in Portugal where it was detected since 2002 (Sousa e¢ al., 2009) after the
first identification of its vector, the ampelophagous leafhopper Schapoideus titanus
Ball in 1998. The phytoplasma associated with FD in Spain and Portugal belongs to
the ribosomal subgroup 16SrV-D. This strain shows also epidemic activity in other
countries such as France and Italy. ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’ is the phytoplasma
associated with BN. The study of the geographic distribution of “stolbur’” isolates (tuf
type) in grapevine plants showed that tuf-type a was identified in La Rioja and Navarre
and tuf-type b in Catalonia, Aragon and Navarre. In Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret only
tuf-type b was identified (Batlle et al, 2009). In Spain S. ¢itanus is present in the north of the country: Catalonia (northeast) and
Galicia (northwest). The limit in the distribution of this insect seems to be the south
of Catalonia, any individual has been captured in the viticultural areas of the south of
Catalonia (Ribera d’Ebre and Terra Alta). In Portugal, S. titanus is present in northeast
and central regions as well in Madeira island. The vector of BN, H. obsoletus, is present in all areas were also BN is present, but in low
density populations. The highest number of individuals was recorded in Navarre and
Aragon, whereas in Alava and Catalonia, the population of H. obsoletus was lower. The
peaks of population take place between June 6" and July 14°. In Malta small surveys were carried out in the main grapevine growing areas from 2009
and phytoplasma presence was not detected. Monitoring about insect vectors was not
carried out. Phytoplasmas and vectors involved in fruit tree diseases

European stone fruit yellows is widespread in Spain. ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ has been
identified in plum, apricot, nectarine, peach and almond crops. The vector Cacopsylla
pruniwas identified for the first time in Spain in fruit areas near Barcelona in 2003. The
population of C. pruni is low in Spain, showing higher population in Extremadura and
Catalonia (Barcelona and Tarragona) and lower in Aragén and Valencia. Pear decline disease is widespread in several pear fruit areas of Spain. The main affected
varieties are Llimonera (Jules Guyot), Abate Fettel and Bartlett. Blanquilla variety
shows the lowest incidence of the disease. Apple proliferation is spread only in the
north of Spain, Asturias and Basque country. ‘Cz. P. pyri’ and ‘Cz. P. mali’ are present in
pear and apple orchards in Spain; ‘Ca. P. pyri’ was recently identified also in the central
region of Portugal (Table 1). Cacopsylla pyri is, as in other Mediterranean areas, the pear decline vector in Spain
and Portugal. It is also a pest in pear orchards of both countries and mainly the only
Cacopsylla detected in the orchards. 59

Chapter 1

Sampling carried out in apple plots of different geographic areas of Spain indicated the
presence of the two species of Cacopsylla reported as vectors of the apple proliferation
disease. The evolution of C. picta and C. melanoneura populations showed two peaks,
one for adults re-immigrants in early April and the other for new generations between
June and July (Table 2). The populations of C. picta are higher than those of C.
melanoneura (Laviiia et al., 2011). Table 1. Presence of phytoplasma diseases in fruit trees and grapevine in Spain. . . Phytoplasma ;

Other phytoplasmas detected

Phytoplasmas belonging to the “stolbur” group (16SrXII) were detected in willow
(Salix babylonica Linn) showing yellows ball-like structures and small leaves symptoms
collected in the east of Spain (Alfaro et al, 2011), in Dianthus caryophyllus, in
solanaceous and in other horticultural crops. Phytoplasmas clustering in the 16SrIII group, ‘Cz. P. pruni’, were detected in faba bean
(Vicia faba L.) plants showing symptoms of shoe stringed leaves, phyllody and flower
abortion in the south of Spain (Castro et al., 2004). ‘Ca. P. pini’ has been detected in
Pinus halepensis in the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Phytoplasmas related to group
16SrVI, ‘Ca. P. trifolii, where identified in Capsicum annuum plants showing short
internodes and green flowers buds. ‘Ca. P. asteris’ has been detected in ornamental and
horticultural plants. References

Abstract

A number of phytoplasma diseases were reported for the firse time in both Greece and
Turkey, while in Italy beside some new finding the work was mainly carried out to verify
epidemiological features of grapevine and fruit tree phytoplasmas towards their sustainable
management. In Israel there was confirmation of phytoplasma presence mainly in horticultural
crops and identification of possible insect vector species. Key words: grapevine, fruit trees, ‘Candidatus’ Phytoplasma, molecular characterization. Introduction

The improvements on phytoplasma and vector knowledge in Italy, Greece, Turkey
and Israel obtained in the frame of the COST FA0807 are of great impact for the
Mediterranean areas of these Countries and for the EU as well. The information
concerns new plant hosts of phytoplasmas, new vectors, development of new techniques
for pathogen detection, and production of novel tools and strategies for disease
containment. Also, the characterization of phytoplasma infecting already established
hosts allowed to give more detailed information concerning taxonomy, etiology and
epidemiology of several crops including grapevine, fruit tree species, cereals and
ornamental plants. In particular a new phytoplasma infecting bindweed has been found
and described by Martini and colleagues (2012). Grapevine

Grapevine appears to be the most investigated crop in terms of phytoplasma
characterization and of phytoplasma group and subgroup involved in the grapevine
yellows (GY) etiology. For “flavescence dorée” (FD) interesting achievements allowed
Filippin and colleagues (2009) to identify different plant species as new hosts of the
phytoplasma agent such as Clematis vitalba and Ailanthus altissima. Also, the same
research group showed the capacity of Dictyophara europaea to transmit the FD
phytoplasma from C. vitalba to grapevine. FD phytoplasma characterization has been
also conducted in different areas of Italy by other groups using ribosomal and non
ribosomal genes in single and multilocus sequence analysis. The use of these techniques
made it possible to draw a more precise picture of the presence and the distribution of

62

ED phytoplasma strains in Italy (Bertaccini et a/., 2009). Recently in Turkey has been
also detected for the first time the presence of 16SrV and 16SrIX phytoplasmas (Ertunc
et al., 2013), the latter phytoplasma group is the same of phytoplasmas associated with a
tremendous diseases of almond and other stone fruit trees in EU geographic contiguous
Countries such as Lebanon. Also for “bois noir” (BN) several works underlined the molecular diversity among
the BN stains based on analysis of different phytoplasma genes (Pacifico et al., 2009),
helping to investigate the presence of BN in wild plants, mainly weeds, in vineyard and
their role as reservoir for the phytoplasma and its vector Hyalesthes obsoletus. The BN
ecology in fact is critical for the disease management in particular for the production
of healthy plant material to be provided to nursery companies and for surveys and tests
to be carried out by the phytosanitary services. The BN phytoplasma was detected and
studied in Israel, Italy and Turkey. Fruit trees

Among the plant quarantine phytoplasma apple proliferation (AP) took an important
part in the research activities in Italy, Turkey and Greece often related to outbreaks
of the disease such as in Italy and Greece (Rumbou et a/., 2011). The phytoplasma
characterization have been accompanied to the investigation on vector/s ecology
allowing to draw a more precise map of the disease in Italy based on phytoplasma strain
information on 165 rDNA and multilocus sequence analysis (Casati et al, 2011). In
Turkey also European stone fruit yellows and pear decline were studied together with
other phytoplasmas infecting fruit trees. Israel

Symptoms related to phytoplasma presence were observed in several ornamental and
horticultural crops located in a number of production areas of Israel. Molecular analyses
focused on carrot revealed that a high percentage of symptomatic plants tested positive
for Spiroplasma citri. Some of the plants were infected by S. citri and a phytoplasma. Leafhopper species known to vector phytoplasmas and/or spiroplasmas, have also been
trapped in several locations (Gera et a/., 2011). References

Abstract
A short report about main phytoplasma-related activity carried out in these Countries is

presented in relationship with COST activity and collaborations in the frame of the action. Key words: Epidemic, management, phytoplasma disease, insect vector, prevention. Introduction

The International Countries Institutions approved during the life of this action are 20
(Figure 1) with about 50 participants in total (14% of the Action participants). These
countries interacted actively sharing relevant information about disease management,
hosting some STSMs and producing joint publications with COST members of the
Action. A dedicated scientific journal “Phytopathogenic Mollicutes” printed in India,
available also on line, and edited between Italy and India was also developed and started
to be printed during the Action. It published full papers presented at the meeting
on dissemination of management strategies held in Barcelona and will continue to
publish research related to phytoplasmology. Members of the majority of International
Countries interacted actively attending some of the meetings held during the Action
and presented papers (Thailand, India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Chile, Canada, Colombia
and Iran). The four Institutions from four countries with reciprocal agreement
contributed to the network by adding important data and information about detection,
vector identification and management strategies for crops and species that are present
also in COST Countries or that could be imported or traded into, since they represent
relevant agricultural environments having commercial trading with EU (South Africa,
Argentina, New Zealand and Australia). Selected activity carried out by some Countries
is presented in this chapter. Specific significant achievements related to the Action in
some of the other International Countries are summarized below. South America

Chile. The research was focused on grapevine and fruit trees phytoplasmas in which
“stolbur’, X disease, ash yellows, and aster yellows were mainly detected (Gonzales
et al., 2011; Longone et al., 2011). Some potential insect vectors were identified and
tested to verify phytoplasma presence mainly in vineyards. In Amplicephalus curtulus
Linnavuori & De Long, phytoplasmas belonging to subgroup 16SrI-B and 16StXILA
were identified, while in Paratanus exitiosus (Beamer) phytoplasmas of the subgroups

67

Chapter 2

16SrI-B, 16StVIL-A and 16SrXII-A were detected. Phytoplasmas belonging to subgroup
16SrI-B and 16SrVII-A were identified in Convoloulus arvensis L. and Polygonum
aviculare L.,to subgroup 16StXII-A in C. arvensis, and to subgroup 16S¢VILA in Galega
officinalis L. (Fiore et al., 2012). The epidemic situation appears to be mainly linked to
environmental factors and there are not severe outbreaks, probably also related to the
strict quarantine control and the reduced importation of propagation materials. Brazil. A number of plant species are affected by phytoplasma diseases, comprising
wild and cultivated crops. Amongst the recently botanic species reported as natural
phytoplasma host is sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) with huanglongbing symptoms in
which ‘Candidatus Liberibacter’ species are described as major agents (Gasparoto et
al., 2012). The majority of phytoplasmas identified in Brazil belongs to groups 16Sr1
and 16SrIII (Montano ef a/., 2011). Relevant studies are also carried out to find a
sustainable management of the corn stunt disease that is associated with phytoplasma
and spiroplasma presence (de Oliveira et a/., 2013). Africa

Mauritius. Severe disease outbreaks were reported in tomato, onion, watercress and okra
cultivations and associated phytoplasmas were aster yellows and “stolbur” (Gungoosingh-
Bunwaree et a/., 2010; 2011; 2013). One interesting feature is the genetic variability
found in the detected strains. Research are in progress focused on transmission ways of
the detected phytoplasmas in that restricted environment (small island). South Africa. Grapevine yellows is a widespread phytoplasma disease and symptoms
were observed for the first time in South Africa in 2006. Since then, the agent associated
with the disease has been identified as aster yellows (AY) phytoplasma (Engelbrecht e¢ a/.,
2010; Carsterns e¢ a/., 2011). Symptoms of the disease initially occurred on grapevines
in two production regions, Olifants River and Wabooms River, but recently it spread
also near Robertson and Trawal in the Western Cape Province. Mgenia fuscovaria (Stal)
was identified as a vector for the disease (Douglas-Smith er a/., 2010). Monitoring and
eliminating infected plants represented the main management way to contain the epidemic. More joint studies are in progress to better characterize the epidemic aster yellows strain. Asia

Iran. Witches’ broom disease of lime (WBDL) associated with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
aurantifolia’ presence, is responsible for major losses of Mexican lime trees (Citrus
aurantifolia L.) and it is among the major phytoplasma problems in the country. A
comprehensive program to contribute in controlling this destructive agent was carried
out enclosing genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics
analyses that were able to provide some insight into plant stress tolerance mechanisms
(Mardi era/., 2011). The recent production of a specific antiserum with new technologies
is also helping in massive detection of infected citrus plants and therefore improved the
disease management in this country (Shahryari e¢ a/., 2011; 2013). 68

Azerbaijan. During a survey on temperate fruit tree orchards in the Guba region North
of Azerbaijan, a yellows on peach was associated with a ‘Cz. P. brasiliense’ strain that was
molecularly characterized. It represents the first strain of this phytoplasma studied in a
plant other than hibiscus and elsewhere than Brazil (Balakishiyeva er a/., 2010). Thailand. Sugarcane white leaf (SCWL) is the most destructive known sugarcane
disease in Asia, especially in Thailand and is transmitted by the leafhoppers
Matsumuratettix hiroglyphicus (Mutsumura) and Yamatotettix flavovittatus. So far there
is no sugarcane resistant variety or effective method to control this disease. Bacterial
symbionts in M. hiroglyphicus were characterized to exploit possibility of their use for
insect population control method. Dominant bacterial types found were an unknown
Betaproproteobacterium (BAMH) and ‘Candidatus Sulcia muelleri. In addition
culturable bacteria isolated and cultured include Gram-positive Bacillus spp. and Gram-
negative Pseudoacidovorax spp. (Wangkeeree et al., 2012). Oceania

New Zealand. ‘Ca. P. australiense’ occurs in New Zealand and Australia where it is
associated with plant diseases in native, weed and crop plants. Between January 2009
and July 2010, four new diverse hosts of ‘Ca. P. australiense’ have been identified in New
Zealand: potato, Jerusalem cherry, swan plant and celery, as well as in a new disease in
boysenberry. Partial suf gene sequence analysis of 29 strains from the new plant hosts
revealed that they belong to two separate subgroups, tuf variant VII and tuf variant
IX. Two of the strains, one from potato and the other from celery, contained a mixed
infection of both phytoplasma subgroups (Liefting et a/., 2011). Figure 1. International

Abstract

A national survey was conducted in Lebanon in 2009/2010 and updated in 2012 in order to
determine the extent of spread of almond witches’ broom disease associated with ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma phocnicium’ in the country, as well as to conduct preliminary research about the
disease epidemiology and further molecular characterization of the phytoplasma. Over four
years of continuous work, Lebanese and Italian efforts were joined to map the endemic areas
as opposed to focus areas, to discover the phytoplasma vector(s) and to elaborate preliminary
management plans. Key words: phycoplasma, stone fruits, nursery, control measures. Introduction

‘Candidatus Phytoplasma phoenicium’ a member of the 16S rDNA phytoplasma group
IX, is considered the aetiological agent of almond witches’ broom (AlmWB) disease,
which caused in Lebanon the death of more than 100,000 almond trees in the last
decade (Abou-Jawdah et a/., 2002). In the last few years, severe infections, frequently
associated with a noticeable yield reduction, have also been observed on peach and
nectarine trees (Abou-Jawdah et al., 2009). Almond witches’ broom determines on
almonds the death of the trees in a few years, causing impressive economical losses for
the farmers, drastically reducing the production. Moreover, since the disease is spreading

71

Chapter 2

also in nectarine and peach orchards, it represents a very dangerous threat not only for
the Lebanese, but also for all the Mediterranean cultivations of these stone fruits. A national survey was conducted in Lebanon in 2009/2010 and updated in 2012 in order
to determine the extent of spread of almond witches’ broom disease (AlmWB) associated
with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma phoenicium’ presence in the country, divided in 26
districts, where local offices of the “Ministry of Agriculture extension services” are located. ‘Training sessions for sixty technicians have been conducted in order to train the extension
service personnel about the disease symptoms and the sample collection methods. The national survey of orchards and nurseries

During 2012, according to the national census, all 561 stone fruit cultivated regions
have been visited, in order to collect leaf samples for the detection of phytoplasma
presence. During the survey, 1,419 orchards have been monitored; each orchard was
located by GPS, in order to record its position and to draw a regional map on the spread
of the disease in the area using the GIS (Geographic Information System) software. During the visits all the trees present in each orchard were monitored for almond
witches’ broom symptom presence. In order to confirm the infection of symptomatic
plants or to verify the presence of the pathogen in trees showing doubtful symptoms,
an average of 15 leaf samples were collected in each district and processed for ‘Cz. P.
phoenicium’ identification. A common protocol of detection has been established and
shared among three laboratory units at AUB, LARI and USEK departments, by using
the semi-specific primer pair AIWF2/AIWR2 (Abou-Jawdah et a/., 2003). A total of
231 samples were collected and processed. A complete survey of 279 mother plants at the LARI-Tal Amara station (used for the
Lebanese certified seedling production), as well as of 136 registered and non-registered
nurseries has been implemented, in order to check the phytosanitary status of the
nursery sector in Lebanon. A scientific committee has been created to discuss and share,
every 6 months, the partial achieved results and the strategies to be implemented among
all the involved partners and subjects. The research about the phytoplasma vector(s) is still on going and in order to reduce the
foci of infection in the country, an eradication plan has been first implemented in a pilot
area (Zahle district) in 2012 and then extended to seven districts in 2013. Results

Almond, peach and nectarine orchards were severely affected and the number of infected
trees was increasing. Out of 231 samples, 158 tested positive to the analyses (Table 1). The presence of the disease, detected in 16 out of 26 districts in 2010, was also confirmed
in two new districts in 2012 (Bent Jbeil and Bcharre); positive samples have been detected
in stone fruit orchards located in 221 out of 561 monitored villages (Figure 1). 72

Two additional 16SrIX subgroups were detected (-F and -G) in addition to the prevalent
subgroup -D (Molino Lova et a/., 2011). Concerning the nursery sector, 282 samples were collected and analyzed from
registered and non-registered nurseries as well as 279 samples from mother trees in Tal
Amara station. All the mother plants were negative for AlmWB phytoplasma presence. However, five out of 136 visited nurseries were found selling seedlings that tested
positive for AlmWB; a prompt decision from the Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture was
adopted to destroy all the seedlings. Extension workshops have been organized for 593 farmers and 47 nurserymen. In
2012, pilot areas were selected, elimination of 182 AlmWB-infected trees and their

elimination and crop replacement has been implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture
to reduce the impact of the disease and to support the rural affected areas in Baalback,
West Bekaa, Rachaya, Hasbaya, Marjayoun, Bent Jbeil and Jezzine districts. A total of
6,206 infected trees have been eliminated until the end of October, 2013 in 91 villages. The 674 involved farmers will receive from the Ministry of Agriculture new fruit tree
seedlings, adapted to the different regions, in compensation for their economic losses. Conclusions

The complex epidemiology of phytoplasma diseases, mainly of ‘Cz. P. phenicium’
necessitates cooperation of researchers in different disciplines in order to understand the
disease epidemiology and to develop appropriate disease containment and management
strategies. Legislation and control measures are urgently necessary to limit the diffusion
of almond witches’ broom in Lebanon but also to avoid its spread to other Middle East
countries and to Europe. References

Abstract
During a survey carried out in Jordanian vineyard plants showing typical grapevine yellows
disease symptoms were observed. Total DNA was extracted from leaf veins for PCR analysis. PCR products sequenced shared 99.5% sequence identity with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
solani. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the affiliation of phytoplasma strains identified in
grapevine to ‘Ca. P, solani’ (subgroup 16SrXII-A), opening an avenue to future studies on the
dissemination and impact of “bois noir” disease in Jordan vineyards. Key words: grapevine yellows, disease, Jordan, PCR/RELP, sequencing. Introduction

“Bois noir” (BN) is a disease of the grapevine yellows (GY) complex associated
with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’ (subgroup 16SrXII-A) presence, and mainly
transmitted by the polyphagous cixiid Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret (Alma et al., 1987;
Quaglino e¢ al., 2009; 2013). BN is largely spread in Europe and in countries of the
Mediterranean basin, but in the last years its presence was reported also in South
America, South Africa, Iran and China (Botti and Bertaccini, 2006; Gajardo e¢ al.,
2009; Karimi ef al, 2009; Duduk et al., 2010). In the present work BN presence in
Jordan is reported. Materials and methods

During a survey carried out in vineyards in August and October 2012, grapevine
plants showing typical grapevine yellows disease symptoms were observed. In the same
vineyards, bindweed plants showing stunting and leaf chromatic alteration were found,
suggesting the involvement of phytoplasmas in the disease etiology. Total DNA was
extracted from leaf veins of 25 symptomatic and two asymptomatic grapevines, and

76

from five symptomatic and two asymptomatic bindweeds. Phytoplasma detection by
nested PCR assays was carried out using universal primer pairs P1/P7 followed by
RIGF2n/R16R2 (Lee e¢ al., 1998). DNAs from periwinkle plants infected by ‘Ca. P.
asteris’ strain SAY (group 16Sr1), ‘Ca. P. solani’ strain STOL (group 16SrXIN), and ‘Ca. P. ulmi’ strain EY1 (group 16SrV), were used as positive controls. DNAs from healthy
periwinkle and reactions without template DNA were employed as negative controls. RIGF2n/RIGR2 PCR products amplified from grapevine and bindweed samples were
sequenced and analysed through the software BlastN (sequence identity), BioEdit
(alignment), iPhy Classifier (group/subgroup affiliation), and MEGA 5 (phylogeny). Results and discussion

Amplification of a band of the expected size (1,250 nt) in three grapevines and in
five bindweeds, and in the positive controls through 16S rDNA nested PCRs was
observed. No amplification was obtained with DNA from 22 symptomatic grapevines,
probably because samples were collected late in the growing season and phytoplasma
distribution in plants was non-uniform (Skoric et a/., 1998; Constable et al, 2003),
nor from asymptomatic plants and negative controls. PCR products were sequenced
by commercial services in Italy (Primm, Milan) and Korea (Macrogen Inc., Soul). Representative 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences were deposited in NCBI GenBank
with accession number KC835139 (from grapevine) and KC835 140 (from bindweed). The 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences shared >99.5% sequence identity with ‘Ca. P. solani’ reference strain STOL (AF248959), and carried identical STOL-unique
signature sequences and distinguishing sequence blocks (Quaglino et a/., 2013; Salem
et al., 2013). Phylogenetic and in silico RFLP analyses confirmed the affiliation of
phytoplasma strains identified in grapevine and bindweed in Jordan to ‘Ca. P. solani’
(subgroup 16SrXII-A), opening an avenue to future studies on the dissemination and
impact of “bois noir” disease in Jordan. These studies may add new information about BN, previously reported in neighboring
countries (Davis, et al., 1997; Choueiri et al., 2002; Contaldo er a/., 2011). Further
studies will investigate the role of Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret, a polyphagous cixiid
responsible for the BN phytoplasma transmission in Europe, and other possible insect
vector(s) in the BN spread in Jordan. References

Abstract

Almond witches’ broom disease spread rapidly over the Lebanese territory in the last years
causing severe economic damages. Previous investigations on insect vectors were focused on
leafhoppers. A survey carried out through the years 2010-2012 was aimed at the cixiid-fauna
present in Lebanese almond and nectarine orchards and its natural infection by phytoplasma
The lise of the collected genera and, among them, the carriers of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
phoenicium’ is presented. Key words: Almond witches’ broom , cixiids, stone fruits, vectors, field samplings. Introduction

The presence and rapid spread of almond witches’ broom (AlmWB) in Lebanon, causing
serious economic losses, entails the activity of one or more insect vectors. Previous
investigations focused on the family Cicadellidae showed Asymmetrasca decedens Paoli
to be the most abundant species in stone fruit orchards and able to carry ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma phoenicium’ Although other leathopper species, usually present in very
low density in the orchards and belonging to the subfamilies Typhlocybinae and
Deltocephalinae were found positive to the phytoplasma as well, their vector ability has
never been proved by transmission trials (Abou-Jawdah ef al; 2003, Dakhil ef al., 2011). Beside the leafhoppers some cixiid (planthopper) species are known as vectors of
phytoplasmas to various crops (Maixner, 1994; Jovié ef al., 2007; Pinzauti et al, 2008). For
this reason this survey was focused on the cixiid-fauna present in almond and nectarine
orchards of Lebanon with particular attention on their natural infection by phytoplasmas. 79

Materials and methods

The project was realized through the years 2010-2012 based on intensive samplings
carried out by means of Malaise and yellow sticky traps. The survey took place in two
AlmWB infected orchards, one in the north and one in the south of Lebanon, planted
with almond and nectarine trees, respectively. Additional direct samplings with a hand-
held D-vac were performed in the same key-orchards and their surroundings (Figure
1). All cixiids captured with the different methods were identified by morphological
features and subsequently analysed for phytoplasma detection. Total DNA was subjected to direct and nested PCR assays, using the primer pair
AIWF2/AIWR2 (Abou-Jawdah e¢ a/., 2003) and the primer pair P1/P7 (Deng and
Hiruki, 1991; Smart et al., 1996), followed by the primers R1G6F2n/R16R2 (Gundersen
and Lee, 1996) universal for phytoplasmas. Nested PCR products were then sequenced
and analysed by iz silico RFLP to identify the 16Sr group/subgroup. Figure 1. a) Malaise trap in Kfarkela orchad; b) yellow sticky trap in Kfarkela orchard; c) and d) direct sampling

Results

 

The following cixiid genera were collected during the field samplings: Cixius, Tachycixius,
Eumecurus, Oliarus, Pentastira, Pentastiridius and Hyalesthes. Several species were
distinguished within each genus the taxa of which are in many cases still unclear. The expected fragment of approximately 390 bp was obtained with the primer pair AIWF2/
AIWR2 in the four genera Cixius, Tachycixius, Eumecurus and Hyalesthes. Nucleotide
sequence analyses confirmed the presence of ‘Cz. P. phoenicium’-related phytoplasmas
while in silico RFLP analyses on R16F2n/R16R2 amplicons evidenced that the strains
infecting insect specimens in Lebanon belong to the subgroup 16SrIX-B. Discussion

These results highlight the role of planthoppers in the epidemiology of AlmWB disease. Nevertheless transmission trials are needed to assess their vector activity and further studies
about their identification at the species level are required. Concerning the latter, a deep
systematic revision is desirable to solve the taxonomic critical situation of cixiid family. Moreover, since almost no information is known about their biology, further investigations
to verify their host plants and their population dynamics are recommended to better
understand the disease spread and epidemiology to define suitable control strategies. References

Abstract

Up to now phytoplasmas enclosed in four ribosomal groups (16SrI, 16SrIII, 165:VII
and 16SrXIII) have been detected in Argentina infecting more than 20 plant species. The X-disease (16SrIII) is one of the most spread phytoplasma group; not only it is
represented by a high number of subgroups, but it has also a wide host range. Among
the 16SrIII subgroups described, -B, -J and two new subgroups W and -X have been
reported, Also new phytoplasmas have been identified belonging to 16SrI-B and -S
(new subgroup), 16SrVII-B and -C and 16SrXIII-C subgroups. Epidemiological studies
show that phytoplasmas in important crops such as garlic and alfalfa are present with
high prevalence and low incidence. The transmission of the agent associated with alfalfa
witches’ broom (ArAWB) is being studied under controlled conditions. Genes encoding
immunodominant membrane proteins were identified in this local phytoplasma genome
and specific antisera against proteins potentially involved in phytoplasma-host interactions
are being produced. Key words: phylogenetic relationship, 16S rDNA, characterization, interaction, vectors. Introduction

Phytoplasmas enclosed into four different groups have been detected so far in
Argentina: 16SrI (aster yellows); 16SrIII (X-disease); 16SrVII (ash yellows), and
16SrXIII (Mexican periwinkle virescence), in over 20 plant species, some economically
important such as garlic (Allium sativum L.), China-tree (Melia azedarach L.),
strawberry (Fragaria x anannassa D.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), causing variable
damages and losses. Phytoplasmas were also detected in ornamental, native and weed
plant species (Table 1). The first phytoplasma detected and studied in Argentina was the China-tree decline
phytoplasma. China-tree was introduced in Argentina from Asia for ornamental

82

The phytoplasmas and phytoplasma vectors in COST FA0B07 International Countries

and forestry purposes. In the late 1970s, the first symptomatic trees were seen; they
showed leaf size reduction and yellowing, shoot proliferation, internode shortening,
severe stunting and gradual necrosis of the plant. Vazquez et al. (1983) described the
China-tree decline as a mycoplasma-like disease. The association of the China-tree
decline disease with a phytoplasma was later confirmed by polymerase chain reaction
assays (Gomez et al., 1996). A polyclonal antiserum, produced from infected China-
tree plants, offered a rapid and simple tool to detect affected plants and to associate
this pathogen with symptoms in other important crops. The antiserum, when used at
ahigher concentration, detected other phytoplasmas present in garlic (Allium sativum
L), peach (Prunus persica L.) and tona (Toona ciliata) (Gomez et al., 1996). Later
studies have been initiated on the distribution, host range and classification of newly
detected phytoplasmas in Argentina. Data from pathogens found in other regions cannot be used directly in these areas
because different pathogens influenced by the role that insect vectors play in each case
may be present (Lee ef a/., 2000). For this reason, the work is focused on detection
and molecular characterization of new phytoplasmas, on identification of different
species of Hemiptera vectors, and on the components involved in the phytoplasma
transmission. Epidemiological studies of phytoplasmas diseases in different crops
and study of proteins potentially involved in host-pathogen interaction are also in
progress. Identification and molecular characterization

The phytoplasmas detected in Argentina have been recognized by symptom
observation and detected by PCR amplification using universal primers (Lee et al.,
1993; 1998). In most cases, amplicons produced by PCR assays have been analyzed
with RFLP procedures, cloned, sequenced and compared with database sequences. Phylogenetic studies have been made and specific primers were designed when
necessary, in order to increase the efficiency in detection. When possible, the pathogen
has been transmitted to periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus G Don) by grafting or by
Cuscuta subinclusa transmission. Up to now four 16Sr phytoplasma groups in more than 20 plant species have been
identified (Table 1). The highest number and widest distribution of strains was found
in 16SrIII (X-disease) group affecting vegetables, woody, ornamental and native plant
species, showing typical leaf size reduction, witches’ broom and internode shortening. According to the classification scheme based on PCR/RFLP of 16S rDNA, the strains
belong to subgroups -B, -J (Galdeano er al., 2004; Fernandez et al., 2013a; Guzman e¢
al., 2014) and to two new subgroups W and -X (Galdeano et al, 2013). As regards
16SrI (aster yellows) group, subgroups -B and -S were found in periwinkle, carrot
and chamomile (‘Torres e¢ a/., 2004; 2011). Phytoplasmas belonging to 16SrVII (ash
yellows) group were detected in herbaceous plants, with representatives of subgroups

83

Chapter 2

-B and -C. The predominant symptoms were witches’ broom, phyllody and leaf size
reduction (Conci et al., 2005; Meneguzzi et al., 2008; Fernandez et al., 2013). The
16SrXIII (Mexican periwinkle virescence) group was detected in China-tree and in
strawberry (Arneodo ef al., 2007; Fernandez et al., 2008) associated with decline,
redness and leaf size reduction. Asa result, in Argentina at least in three phytoplasmas have been identified as belonging
to unique subgroups. Several of these pathogens were identified exclusively in South
America, suggesting mechanisms of evolutionary divergence mediated by geographical
isolation (Lee et al., 2000). Epidemiological studies

Epidemiological studies were carried out in production areas of crops systematically
affected by phytoplasma diseases. When possible, apart from disease distribution, the
associated Hemiptera fauna has been studied as well as yield losses. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is one of the most widespread cultivated forage species. Almost 19 years ago, an outbreak of a disease causing severe witches’ broom was
observed in alfalfa fields for seed production in the ‘Cuyo’ region (Andean Midwest)
(Hijano and Pérez Fernandez, 1995). A phytoplasma was detected, named Argentinean
alfalfa witches’ broom (ArAWB), and characterized as a new subgroup (16SrVII-C) of
the ash yellows group (Conci et a/., 2005). More than 30 leafhopper species have been
identified within alfalfa crops and surrounding weeds. In three of them the ArAWB
phytoplasma was consistently detected by PCR and potential insect vectors were
identified. A high prevalence of the disease was registered in the studied region, and
the disease incidence increased (reaching 12%) with crop age leading to premature
plant death (Meneguzzi, 2009). In garlic (Allium sativum L.) production fields, the main Argentina's export vegetable,
a phytoplasma has been identified in the disease known as “garlic decline” (Conci et
al., 1998). According to 16S ribosomal gene sequence analysis and RFLP pattern, the
garlic decline phytoplasma (GDIII) was related to 16SrIII (X-disease) subgroup -J
(Galdeano ef al., 2004). In entomofauna studies, many Cicadellidae species were found
and this phytoplasma was detected in at least one of them (Catalano ef a/., 2008). Further studies are focused on the detection of other potential insect vectors. The
disease occurs in all producing areas of the country with high prevalence (23-100%
fields had at least one diseased plant) and low incidence (0.03-0.78%) (Galdeano
et al., 2009). Cultivars Morado and Blanco are more susceptible to GDIII since
incidence and prevalence are significantly higher than in cultivars Colorado. Blanco
and Colorado are traditionally planted in Argentina, however the Morado cultivar has
been introduced from Asia within the last 25 years, and represents a high percentage
of the garlic cultivated area at this time. The severity of the disease is extremely high in
garlic and leads to death of the plant in early infections. However, the apparent absence

84

The phytoplasmas and phytoplasma vectors in COST FA0B07 International Countries

of an efficient vector reduces the disease incidence, and symptom remission during
sprouting has been also observed (Galdeano et al., 2009). Thestrawberryleafphytoplasma (16SrXIII) hasbeen reported exclusively associated with
strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D. cv camarosa) crops in Argentina. Epidemiological
studies showed that the strawberry lethal redness is present with a 62% of prevalence and
low incidence (0.45%) in strawberry production areas (F.D. Fernandez, pers. comm.). The increasing spread of the China-tree decline led to a drastic reduction of its use for
forestation. The phytoplasma (ChTDII) was classified within subgroup 16SrIII-B
(Gémez et al., 1996; Galdeano et al., 2004). Distribution studies established that
throughout the central and northwestern provinces of Argentina there are trees affected
by this phytoplasma, while in the northeast provinces and Tucuman (two regions
sharing similar agro-ecological characteristics) another phytoplasma (China-tree
yellows; ChTYXIII) belonging to 16SrXIII (Mexican periwinkle virescence) group of
the new subgroup —C is associated with the disease. In addition, several trees sampled
in the northeastern provinces and Tucumén were found to have double infections
with 16SrIII-B and 16SrXII-C phytoplasmas. In the northeastern provinces, both
phytoplasmas (CKTDIII and ChTYXIII) were found at similar frequency (Arneodo
etal, 2007). Vectors

Hemiptera insects (1 Membracidae and 37 Cicadellidae species) collected from
alfalfa fields and surrounding weeds have been identified, the relative abundance of
each species was established and the presence of the phytoplasma within the insect
was determined (Meneguzzi, 2009). The population curves of infective insects were
established in three species that were detected as potential vectors of the ArAWB
phytoplasma. Based on such results, the transmission of the agent associated with
alfalfa witches’ broom (ArAWB) is being studied in controlled conditions. The
insects are reared in order to study each species transmission parameters. The analysis
of preliminary data obtained from transmission tests led to the hypothesis that
Ceresa nigripectus (Hemiptera, Membracidae) would act as a ArAWB terminal host
(Meneguzzi, 2009). C. nigripectus was reared under experimental conditions and it
was possible to obtain a stable population throughout the year. The number of nymph
stages, duration of each stage as well as the total duration of its biological cycle has
been determined. Also the area of the plant where the females lay their eggs, the shape,
size and color thereof and duration of egg stage were determined. Other plant species
that could act as secondary hosts of the species have been found too (Pérez Grosso
et al., 2013). Currently the characteristics of this species immature stages are being
studied. Furthermore, transmission tests using ArAWB infected plants as a source of
inoculum are performed in order to establish the acquisition, latency and inoculation
times required for the disease establishment. 85

Phytoplasma-host interactions

The great molecular diversity of diseases associated to phytoplasma presence seems to
require studying each particular pathosystem in each region. The development of new
strategies like the analysis of phytoplasma genes encoding immunodominant membrane
proteins, as well as secretion and effector proteins, supports not only the study of
each phytoplasma, but also the knowledge of colonization strategies, adaptation and
pathogenicity mechanisms. Consequently, the genes of interest are being identified in
local phytoplasma genome, and specific antisera against proteins potentially involved in
phytoplasma-host interactions are being produced in order to characterize and localize
pathogen proteins in infected tissues. SecA is a protein with a highly conserved structure among many bacterial species, unique
to bacteria, and differs remarkably from those present in the chloroplasts which make it
an ideal candidate for the generation of a specific antiserum against phytoplasmas. For
this reason, an internal fragment of the SecA coding gene (840 bp) has been amplified
from purified China-tree DNA infected with CKTYXIII (16SrXIII-C), cloned and
expressed in bacterial culture. The purified SecA protein (~38 kDa) has been used in
antiserum production (Fernandez et al., 2011). Phytoplasma effector proteins are involved in the interaction with their hosts and
may interfere with different host cell processes, such as intracellular trafficking, gene
expression and defense responses. The export of these proteins directly into the host
cytoplasm represents a critical role in the host-phytoplasma interaction with marked
impact on pathogenicity mechanisms. Therefore, SAP] lar coding gene (381 bp) has
been amplified from purified C. rosews DNA infected with ACLL (16SrI-S), cloned
and expressed in bacterial culture. The purified SAP1lar protein (~10.9 kDa) was
confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis and is being used in antiserum production. 87

Phytoplasma membrane proteins are in direct contact with their hosts and are supposed
to play a crucial role in the phytoplasma spread within the plant and in the insect vector. Three types of highly abundant and immunodominant membrane proteins (IDP) have
been identified within the phytoplasmas: Amp, IdpA, and Imp. The study of genes
encoding immunodominant membrane proteins of CKTYXIII (16SrXIII-C) has been
recently initiated with the objective of characterize them and compare the nucleotide
sequence with phytoplasmas from other geographic locations. References

risk for urban trees and crops

Abstract

Phytoplasmosis are emergent diseases that affect many urban tree species in Bogoté,
Colombia. Molecular techniques indicate that 16Srl and 16SrVII were the two major groups
of phytoplasmas affecting Acacia melanoxylon, Croton spp., Eugenia myrtifolia, Fraxinus
uhdei, Liquidambar styrciflua, Magnolia grandiflora, Pittosporum undulatum, Populus nigra
and Quercus humboldtii from 2008 to 2013. Groups 16SrV and 16rXII were also detected
in and L. styraciflua. Symptoms such as witches’ brooms, epicormic shoots, tufted foliage,
atypical elongation of apical shoots, small leaves change dramatically the architecture of
the tree crowns. In December of 2013, a preliminary prevalence study showed that the
proportion of affected trees varied between 36% in Croton spp. to 100% in F. uhdei. Symptoms
suggesting phytoplasma involvement have also been observed in other tree species of the area. Phytoplasmosis has spread to trees growing in the surrounding rural areas of Bogota, where
they may act as source of inoculum for crops and other plants. For example, phytoplasmas
of groups 16Srl and 16SrVII have been detected in strawberry crops of the surrounding
Sabana de Bogoté. Since there are no effective treatments, knowledge of the ecology and
epidemiology of these diseases seems the only possibility to propose management strategies. Key words: 16Srl, 16SrV, 16SrVII, 16SrXII, symptoms, prevalence. The importance of urban trees

According to the Department of Economics and Social Affairs of the United Nations,
in 2011 about 50% of the human population lived in urban areas. It is expected that by
2025 58% and by 2050 67% of the population will live in cities (UN, 2014). Therefore,
the conservation of the urban biodiversity, including the trees, should be considered
an important issue for the cities administrators. Trees provide ecological services that
include: reduction of air pollution, control of rain water, carbon storage, improvement
of water quality and reduction of energy consumption and, sheltering for bird, insect
populations and other organisms. In addition, trees generate social benefits such as
human well-being and have an aesthetic value that for example can increase the value
of properties. In Bogota in 2012, the estimated number of trees per 100,000 inhabitants was of
15,757.9. This is equivalent to 0.2 trees per inhabitant, although the OMS recommends
one tree per 0.33 inhabitants (Observatorio Ambiental de Bogota, 2013). The low
number of trees in Bogotd, the economic cost of growing and maintaining them, in

90

addition to the importance for the biodiversity and quality of life, justify the study of
the diseases that affect the health status of the urban trees. Phytoplasmas in Fraxinus uhdei in Colombia

The first disease associated with phytoplasmas in Bogota was described in 2001 in
Fraxinus whdei (Oleaceae) (Griffiths et a/., 2001; Filgueira er al., 2004). E uhdei is native
to Central America and was introduced to Bogota in the decade of 1950, from United
States. It adapted easily to the tropical conditions of Bogoté and soon dispersed to other
cities and rural areas of the Andean zone, located between 1,100 and 2,700 m of altitude. In the decade of 1990 F. uhdei was the predominant tree species of Bogota in streets and
parks of the city. At that time, the health status of the trees began to decay and symptoms
attributed to two independent causes were described. One type of damage was caused by
the feeding habits of Tropidosteptes chapingoensis (Hemiptera: Miridae). Other symptoms
including yellowing, dead branches, dieback, decline, small leaves, deliquescent branching,
tufted foliage and epicormic shooting suggested the presence of phytoplasmas (Griffiths
et al, 2001; Franco-Lara and Filgueira, 2005). These symptoms resembled those of ash
yellows, a disease that affected several species of Fraxinus and Syringa in North America
and is associated with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma fraxini’ presence (group 16SrVII)
(Sinclair and Griffiths, 1996; Griffiths e¢ a/., 1999). The prevalence of the phytoplasma
disease of F whdei has been estimated in Bogota during these years. Observations made
in 2000 on 600 trees showed that 100% of the trees had symptoms, and that 92% of
them were moderately or severely affected. Since the disease was recorded, a large number
of E uhdei were removed, the trees that remain barely survive (Figure 1E). Between
May 2004 and June 2005, a survey was carried out to estimate the infection degree of F
uhdei in the Andean zone of Colombia. Bogota, Medellin, Pereira, Manizales, Armenia
Tunja and Sabana de Bogota (semi-rural area surrounding Bogota) were visited and 106
trees resulted symptomatic. Symptoms associated with phytoplasmas were observed in
all the surveyed areas. In average, 96% of the trees had tufted foliage, 69% deliquescent
branching and 50% epicormic shoots, suggesting the presence of the disease in other areas
of the Andean region (Figure 1A) (Franco-Lara and Filgueira, 2005). The presence of ‘Cu. P. fraxini’ has been demonstrated in the F. uhdei of Bogota. Initially, the molecular detection of phytoplasmas in these trees was extremely difficult
due probably to the low concentration and heterogeneous distribution of phytoplasmas,
unknown patterns of seasonal distribution, occurrence of inhibitors for PCR assays. To
confirm the presence of phytoplasmas in F. whdei DAPI tests on stems and petioles of
symptomatic trees were carried out (Sinclair et a/., 1992). The sections of symptomatic
trees showed non-defined, cloudy spots present exclusively in the phloem (Figure 1B). Those spots were distinguishable from nuclei, rarely detected in the phloem and were
not observed in the negative controls leading to the conclusion that they corresponded
to phytoplasmas. Transmission assays to periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) using dodder

91

Chapter 2

(Cuscuta sp.) were also performed. In the cases in which dodder connected effectively
trees and periwinkle plants, the latters showed symptoms such as virescence, small leaves
and excessive production of shoots in the basal part, whereas the non-infected plants were
symptomless (Figure 1C). The phytoplasma presence was confirmed in the periwinkle
plants by nested PCR of the 16SrRNA gene and by DAPI test (Perilla et a/., 2010). Phytoplasmas of group 16SrVII have been detected in F uhdei. Nested PCR tests with
primers for the 16S:RNA and EF-Tu genes of phytoplasmas were performed on tree DNA
extracts from Bogota and Manizales. Amplicons obtained with P1/P7 or P1/Tint (Smart
et al. 1996) followed by R1GF2n/R16R2 (Gundersen and Lee, 1996) or PhytufL22
(AAGCGCCTGAAAGAAAAA)/ PhytufR24._ (TGATGCCACGTAATTAAAA)
were sequenced. Sequences of both genes showed more than 99% of identity with ash
yellows phytoplasmas from North America (Table 1). Additional confirmation for the
presence of phytoplasmas of group 16SrVII in samples from Bogota and Manizales was
obtained by cloning R16F2n/R1G6R2 amplicons and analysing them by RFLP(Figure 1D). Atthe beginning of the decade of 2000, it was considered that ‘Ca. P. fraxini’ was limited
to the genus Fraxinus and Syringa, and its geographical distribution was restricted to
North America (Sinclair and Griffiths, 1996; Lee et a/., 2000). When in 2001 it was
detected in Bogota, it was considered an exotic disease affecting only this tree species. il | ll ul | I ul) Ma ub . z

Phytoplasmas in other tree species in Bogota

Between 2006 and 2007, alterations of the morphology of the crown of many tree
species began to be observed in Bogota. A very notorious example was Liquidambar
styraciflua (Hamamelidaceae), a North American species introduced to replace in
part the FE whdei affected by phytoplasmas. Later, symptoms suggesting phytoplasmas
were also observed in other introduced species such as Acacia melanoxylon (Fabaceae),
Eugenia myrtifolia (Myrtaceae), Magnolia grandiflora (Magnoliaceae), Pittosporum
undulatum (Pittosporaceae), Populus nigra (Salicacea) and native species such as Quercus
humboldtii (Fagaceae) and Croton spp. (Euphorbiaceae). In all these trees, there is
evidence of changes in the growth patterns of branches or the formation of atypical
vegetative structures that produces tree morphologies divergent from the normal. The most important symptoms have been described for all the tree species (Sinclair
and Griffiths, 1994; Boa, 2003; Phytoplasma Resource Center, 2011, Forestry Images,
2011). In general, the most common symptoms are: tufted foliage (branches with slow
twig growth and short internodes that cause foliage to appear bunched), deliquescent
habit of ramification (several slowly growing twigs near the branch end with no clear
leader), witches’ brooms, epicormic shoots (shoots or leaves that develop from buds in
the trunk or branches that should be inactive), atypical elongation of apical shoots, small
leaves. In Croton spp. the main symptom is the production vegetative structures similar
to leaves that develop from buds and cover large areas of trunks and branches. These
leaflets are brownish-green and densely covered with trichomes (Figure 2). All these
symptoms suggest disturbances of the growth regulators of the trees, characteristic of
phytoplasma diseases (Lee ef al., 2000; Christensen ef al., 2005, Bertaccini and Duduk,
2009). So far, symptoms such as virescence and phyllody have not been observed in
trees of Bogota. In several species yellowing of the foliage was present and although it
could be attributable to other causes, it was included in the description since it is very
often associated with phytoplasma presence. For 4. melanoxylon, E. myrtifolia, F. uhdei
and M. grandiflora it has been shown that the symptoms remain through the year but
gradually become more severe making the trees almost unrecognisable. 93

Fraxinus, but this may be an underestimation. To confirm the phytoplasma presence

94

The phytoplasmas and phytoplasma vectors in COST FA0B07 International Countries

molecular tests including nested PCR, followed by RFLP and sequence analysis have
been carried out. The presence of phytoplasmas was tested with primers that anneal
to the 16S rRNA-23SrRNA gene. Direct reactions were performed with P1A/P7A
(Lee et al., 2004) and amplicons used as templates in subsequent nested reactions using
internal primers R16mF2/R16mR1 or RIGF2n/R1IGR2 (Gundersen and Lee, 1996). Second nested reactions were performed in many cases using fUS/rU3 (Seemiiller
et al, 1994) and PhyRNAF3.3 (AATAGTGGAAAAACTATC)/PhyRNAR2.6
(TGACGGGCGGTGTGTACAAACCCCG) primers. So far the evidence obtained
by RELP and sequence analysis suggests that 16Srl and 16SrVI] are the two major groups
of phytoplasmas affecting the trees in Bogoté (Figure 3A, Table 2) (Perilla and Franco-
Lara, 2012; L. Franco-Lara, unpublished). Groups 16SrV and 16SrXII have also been
detected in L. styraciflua (Franco-Lara et al., 2010; Franco-Lara et al., unpublished). Moreover, the presence of mixed infections in the same tree has been observed (Figure
3B). So fat, sequences corresponding to groups 16Srl and 16SrVII have been obtained
for all the tree species with two exceptions. Sequences of 16SrI have not been obtained
for.A. melanoxylon although it has been detected by RFLP, and 16SrVII sequences have
not been obtained for F uhdei in the tests performed in the last few years, while its
presence has been confirmed by RFLP analyses. These results indicate that phytoplasmas of groups 16Srl and 16SrVII are able to infect
many different families of plants and that frequently they share the same plant host. Interestingly, the sequences of 16SrVII of all the trees tend to show similarities of 99.9
to 100% with previous sequences of Fraxinus from Bogota and North America. This
observation suggests that the original source of inoculum may be the F. #hdei plantlets
brought from North America to Bogota many years ago, from where these phytoplasmas
may have spread to new host species. On the other hand, phytoplasmas of the group
16SrI found in Bogota tend to be more variable than 16SrVII reflecting the fact that this
is a group in which large polymorphisms were reported in 16S rDNA (Lee et al., 2004). However, the sequences 16SrI can be separated in two main groups. One, in which
sequences are more similar to reference strains of subgroups 16SrI-B and 16SrI-D and
a second of sequences that tend to cluster together but not with any known subgroup
(L. Perilla and L. Franco-Lara, unpublished). This may indicate at least two sources of
inoculum for 16S¢I. Perspectives

The evidence obtained so far indicates that phytoplasmas represent a serious risk for the
trees of Bogotd. In addition to the species that we have studied, symptoms suggesting
phytoplasma presence are also visible in other tree species of the area such as Podocarpus
oleifolius, Pinus patula, Salix umboldtiana, Prunus serotina, Carica pubescens. There
are also some protected forests near Bogota, composed primarily of native trees, that
may also be are at risk, but the occurrence of phytoplasmas in them was not tested. 95

Chapter 2

Furthermore, there is evidence of phytoplasmas affecting crops growing near Bogota. This is the case of strawberry in which the groups 16SrI and 16SrVII have been
associated with symptoms of virescence and phyllody (L. Franco-Lara, unpublished). The situation of the trees of Bogota is extremely worrying . As far as we know, there are
no other cases reported in which so many plant species of different families are affected
by phytoplasmas in the same geographic region. Table 2. Principal symptoms, prevalence and groups of phytoplasmas detected in trees of Bogoté. tgsr GenBank

Chapter 2

There are no information about the insect vectors of phytoplasmas in Colombia. However, in the last three years attempts to determine the insect vectors that transmit
phytoplasmas in Bogota have been made. From May 2011 to April 2012, leafhoppers
were captured in grass areas nearby symptomatic trees. Taking into account the external
morphology of the insects they were classified in nine morphotypes (MFO1-MF09). All
of them belong to the Typhlocybinae, Deltocephalinae or Xestocephalinae subfamilies
in the Cicadellidae family (M. Wilson, personal communication). The identification
of the species is underway. Phytoplasmas of groups 16SrVII were detected in three
morphotypes and 16Srl plus 16SrVII in six morphotypes (Franco-Lara and Perilla,
2012). Transmission tests were performed with MF04 and MF06 using insects field-
collected. Interestingly the two morphotypes were able to transmit both groups of
phytoplasmas 16SrI and 16rVII to common bean, under experimental conditions (L.
Franco-Lara, unpublished). Bogoté is located in the Sabana de Bogoté, a plateau of 425,000 ha in the Cordillera
de los Andes at 2,600 m of altitude. It is a continuous plateau delimited by mountains,
many of which are covered with forests comprising many native species. Apart from
Bogota, there are other 21 small cities and towns surrounded by agricultural lands and
grasslands where the vegetation is relatively constant. Since Colombia is located in the
tropical zone, day temperatures (13 to 25°C) and night temperatures (-5 to 10°C) in
the Sabana remain more or less constant during all the year. There are no seasons in the
sense of the temperate zones, but in particular there is no winter. Therefore the Sabana
provides a continuum of landscape structure and climatic conditions that may facilitate
the dispersion of vectors and phytoplasmas. If this is so, an unanswered question is why
the symptoms associated with phytoplasmas appeared only recently. The observation of
phytoplasma-related symptoms in trees began in Fraxinus in about 2000 butit is unclear
when did these symptoms actually appeared. It is important to take into account that
phytoplasma symptoms could not be recognized even by trained phytopathologists. Thus, some tree species may have had undetected symptoms before 2000. However,
observations in A. melanoxylon, Croton spp. L. styraciflua and M. grandiflora among
others, indicate that at least in these species the symptoms began to be observable
around 5 or 6 years ago. Although the weather in the tropical zone is pretty constant, in Colombia it is affected by
the ENSO (El Nifio Southern Oscillation), a meteorological phenomenon that strongly
influences the climate of the Pacific basin. Every 3 to 8 years approximately, the movement
patterns of the marine currents change, affecting the climate of the intertropical zone. In
the Andean region of Colombia ENSO produces rain deficit and draughts. For example,
a very severe ESNO took place in 1997-1998 and during the first decade of the 21°
century four ENSO seasons have occurred. It is conceivably that in those very dry periods
when the plants hosts are under hydric stress, insect vectors may change hosts temporarily
looking for better conditions. If this is the case, phytoplasmas may spread to new, different
plant species, expanding their host range in the years in which droughts are more severe. 98

By studying the ecology and epidemiology of this pathosystem we may be able to provide
management strategies that might reduce phytoplasma associated diseases impacts
in the biodiversity and economy of urban trees. Therefore, more information about
possible herbaceous hosts, plant resistance, species, habits and ecology of insect vectors,
interactions of phytoplasmas of different groups in the same individual plant is needed. Acknowledgement

Abstract

Coffecis among the most important cultivated crops in Colombia, where itis frequently shaded
with nogal cafetero, a tree species also used for timber and reforestation programs. Since 1998
severe cases of phytoplasma-related symptoms were observed in coffee plantations, and starting
on 2002 also in nogal cafetero. Both diseases were associated to 1 6SrIII phytoplasma presence
and different strains from coffee and nogal cafetero were identified having 99% of homology
between them and to several 16SrIII strains in the 165 ribosomal gene. RFLP profiles of
ribosomal protein gene and elongation factor indicate the presence of differentiable strains in a
coffee sample, one of which is the prevalent in nogal cafetero. These results indicate a complex
disease actiology involving more phytoplasma strains in the two studied plant species. Key words: Coffee, nogal, witches’ broom, phytoplasma, 16SrIII. Introduction

Coffee crispiness, a disease of uncertain etiology, has been endemic in coffee (Coffea
arabica L..) plantations in Colombia for at least 60 years. Symptoms typically consist
of bud proliferation, abundant short and narrow leaves, phyllody, floral abortion,
monospermic fruit, and dwarfing of plants (Figure 1). In severe cases, coffee crispiness
disease (CCD) can significantly affect production; it was observed for the first time in
the western Department of Antioquia and, by 1950, it was present in the central region
of the country, subsequently it was detected in the southern Department of Huila. The
disease affect all the C. arabica cultivars planted in Colombia, which historically include
Typica, Bourbon, Caturra, and Colombia. Since 1997, farmers reported an increase in
the symptom severity of CCD in places located over 1,500 m above sea level. This has
been observed both in new plantings and in plants regenerated from stumps, acommon
practice in Colombian plantations (Galvis et a/., 2007). By 2002 the disease was first
reported in the shade tree ‘nogal cafetero’ [Cordia alliodora (Ruiz & Pavén) Oken]
in18 months old plants, in the southwest Department of Caldas and after it was also
observed in Caldas, Risaralda, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and in the germplasm banks in
Quindio (Hernandez er al., 2004). 101

Figure 1. Symptomatic nogal cafetero trees in the germplasm banks in Quindio, showing severe symptoms with
witches’ broom, branch malformation, abnormal shoot sprouting, dried buds and early defoliation. Coffee is a major crop in Colombia and plants are often shaded by nogal cafetero, which
is also used for timber and reforestation in Central and South America and Africa. It is
a frequent component of agroforestry systems, especially since it provides dark coffee
wood, and it is also useful in the production systems of certified coffees. It is a species
that is well suited to be intercropped with agricultural plantations, being an important
component of agroforestry systems. The wood is highly sought after by woodworkers
for its quality, basic density, physical and mechanical properties and resistance to rot
and moths (Rincon, 2009). Although epidemics are confined to limited areas dispersed throughout the Colombian
“coffee belt’, incidence and severity are as high as 90%, resulting in total yield losses. Coffee crispiness disease has been associated with 16SrIII phytoplasma infection (Galvis
et al., 2007, Mejia et al., 2010). Phytoplasmas of the same group were identified through
PCR analyses in nogal cafetero plants showing witches’ broom, branch malformation,
and abnormal shoot sprouting (Galvis and Ospina, 2006, Rincon, 2009, Mejia ef al.,
2010). Further molecular characterization was therefore performed, as a contribution
towards epidemiological studies aimed to prevent the disease from spreading. Plant samples

Symptomatic branches and roots, from three C. arabica plants from Gigante region
(Department of Huila) and five plants belonging to different genotypes from
Paraguaicito (Department of Quindio) showing severe symptoms of crispiness and
withches’ broom were collected. Shoots, leaves and stems for a total of 23 samples were

tested (Table 1). RFLP and sequence analysis

After nucleic acid extraction following the procedure by Prince et a/. (1993) ribosomal
DNA was amplified by nested PCR reaction using primers P1/P7 (Deng and Hiruki,
1991; Schneider et al., 1995) followed by R1GF2n/R2 (Gundersen and Lee, 1996) for
RFLP analyses and by R16mF2/mR1 for sequencing. Ribosomal protein genes including
3 end of rps19, rplV (rpl22), rpsC (rps3) genes were amplified using primers rpL2F3/

102

rp()RIA and group specific primers rp(III)F1/rp(III)R1 (Martini et a/., 2007). Two
pairs of primer cocktails were used for suf gene amplification, Tuf340/Tuf890 and
Tuf400/Tuf835 in direct and nested PCR respectively (Makarova et a/., 2012). Publicly available 16S rDNA, ribosomal protein and elongation factor sequences from
different subgroups of the 16SrIII group (Zhao et al., 2009; Mello et a/., 2011; Makarova
et al., 2012; Davis et al., 2013; Galdeano et al., 2013), were retrieved from GenBank and
aligned with the 16S ribosomal DNA rp and tuf sequences from nogal cafetero and
coffee using CLUSTALX and BioEdit. J silico restriction analysis and virtual RFLP
plotting was performed using pPDRAW32 software (http://www.acaclone.com). Each
sequence was digested with several restriction enzymes and a virtual 4.0% agarose gel
electrophoresis image was plotted for virtual RFLP pattern comparisons. A similarity
coefficient (F) was calculated for each pair of phytoplasma strains according to described
methods (Lee e¢ al., 1998; Nei and Li, 1979). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary
analyses were conducted using MEGA version 5.2 (‘Tamura et a/., 2011). Phylograms
were generated to estimate the relationships based on the neighbour-joining method,
with the reliability provided by 1,000 replications bootstrap test. Table 1. Description of sample tested. Strain Samples Source Province Genotype Tissues

Results and discussion

All symptomatic samples resulted positive to phytoplasma presence. Two phytoplasma
strains from coffee (CCD01 and CCD02) and nogal cafetero (NcWB11 and NeWB15)
respectively, were amplified in nested PCR on 168 DNA, rp and tuf genes using P1/P7,
R16mE2/mRI and rpllIF1/rplUIR1, Tuf400/Taf835 primers. According to the similarity coefficient comparison (Zhao e¢ a/., 2009) the virtual RFLP
patterns derived from the CCD02 and NcWB15, R16F2n/R2 fragment were identical
to each others (similarity coefficient 1.00) and were also undistinguishable from patterns
of phytoplasmas belonging to 16Sr group III-J (GenBank accession: AF147706). The
virtual RFLP patterns derived from the same amplicons of CCD01 and NcWB11 were
different from the reference patterns of all previously reported 16Sr groups/subgroups. The most similar was the profile of 16SrIII- U (GenBank accession: HM589213), with
a similarity coefficient of 0.97 (Figure 4). This strain may represent a new subgroup
within the 16SrIII group. Comparative virtual RFLP patterns identify the key enzyme
HpyCHAvV that distinguish the new subgroup pattern from those of previously
recognized ribosomal groups/subgroups. Actual laboratory restriction digestions with
enzyme HpyCHAV confirm the new subgroup pattern (data not show). In phytoplasmas from both studied species, actual RFLP analysis conducted with Hhal,
Hpall (Figures 2 and 3) and BsfUI (data no show) on the strains NCWB11 and NCWB15
revealed patterns that differed from those described above. They apparently correspond
to profiles of two distinct phytoplasmas, but sequencing of the 16S rRNA revealed
the occurrence of sequence heterogeneity in each strain. This condition was reported
previously for other members of group 16SrIII (Jomantiene ef a/., 2002; Mello er al.,
2006). The presence of sequence heterogeneity may explain the discrepancy observed
between actual and virtual RFLP profiles (Figures 2, 3 and 4). These results suggest that,
in some cases, such as those studied in the present work, key enzymes defined by virtual
RELP analysis do not necessarily behave as such when used to perform actual RELP. Thus, in these cases, the results of virtual RFLP are not confirmed by actual RFLP
analysis (Mello et al,, 2011). Figure 2. Restriction profiles of R16R2n/

The phytoplasmas and phytoplasma vectors in COST FA0B07 International Countries

Differences between the strains were also detected in tuf sequences since the two strains
show 7 SNPs including a specific restriction with Ddel. Further characterisation by
amplification of a 300-bp fragment on the 16SrIII group ribosomal protein operon
followed by RFLP analyses with Tru /I and 7ip509I produced a unique profile for strains
CCD02 and NeWB1S5, while strain NCWB11 was undistinguishable from some of the
described rp subgroups. This indicates the presence of two rp differentiable strains in
the coffee sample, one of which is the prevalent in nogal cafetero (Figure 5), however
the identification in nogal cafetero of two phytoplasma strains that are differentiable
indicates that disease epidemiology is complex and involve probably other species in the
wild environment. Search for insect vectors is in progress. The recent years outbreaks of the phytoplasma diseases in the two species may have
resulted from a combination of the phytoplasma’s presence and the use of chemical for
weed control that could have modified the vector population composition. The close
phylogenetic relationship between the phytoplasmas identified in coffee and in nogal
cafetero suggests also that coffee could be an alternative host for the phytoplasmas
infecting nogal cafetero (Figures 6 and 7). Coffee was introduced in the Country only 200 years ago and 16SrIII phytoplasmas
were shown to be quite widespread in South America. Our results indicate a disease
etiology involving more phytoplasma strains in agreement with evolution of the species
under non epidemic conditions as it is for phytoplasma diseases of these two species in
Colombia. References

Abstract

The most important phytoplasma diseases in the Action Countries are those affecting fruit
trees and grapevine. A short review of their presence and impact on agricultural systems is
reported together with the update information about their recognized insect vectors. Key words: apple proliferation, pear decline, European stone fruit yellows, grapevine yellows,
“flavescence dorée’, “bois noir”. Introduction

Phytoplasmas are microorganisms phloem-limited therefore only phloem-feeding
insects can potentially acquire and transmit them. All known phytoplasmas are
transmitted by insects in the order Hemiptera. However, vector species are restricted
to only a few families of the suborder Auchenorrhyncha: namely, Cercopidae, Cixiidae,
Derbidae, Delphacidae, Cicadellidae and in the Sternorrhyncha: Psyllidae (Weintraub
and Beanland, 2006). Within a family, some species are known to be phytoplasma
vectors, while others are not. But even within the same species different populations,
mostly geographically separated, may occur, which are competent pathogen vectors in
one area, but not in another. Updated knowledge on the distribution of a disease as
well as the presence and vector status is very important for pest risk assessment and
phytosanitary decisions. Therefore, the main goal of WG 2 “Epidemiology and vector
ecology” of the COST action was to establish a vector monitoring system throughout
Europe to identify phytoplasma vector species, monitor their spread throughout the
COST countries, and to coordinate research into these and other means in which
phytoplasmas are spread. Thus, WG2 activities included morphological identification
and molecular characterization of vector species and populations, a questionnaire
survey about distribution of phytoplasma diseases and their putative vectors throughout

different European regions, research of different means of disease spread and the
modelling of particular epidemiological cycles and their consequences for direct control
strategies. As a result, a comprehensive database was established procuring a current
overview on the dispersal of the most important phytoplasma diseases and vectors in
most Action member countries and models for particular pathosystems were generated. Fruit tree phytoplasmas and their vectors

The genetically closely related ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali, ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ and
“Ca. P. pyri’ (Seemiiller and Schneider, 2004) are associated with economically important
diseases in European fruit tree areas, respectively apple proliferation (AP), European
stone fruit yellows (ESFY) and pear decline (PD). Whilst most phytoplasmas are
transmitted by insect vectors of the hemipteran suborder Auchenorrhnycha (leafhoppers,
planthoppers, treehoppers), all these fruit tree agents are spread by Sternorrhyncha
of the superfamily Psylloidea (Weintraub and Beanland, 2006). Interestingly, the
psyllid vector species all belong to the genus Cacopsylla and both, phytoplasmas and
psyllid vectors, were geographically limited to Europe and the Palearctic ecozone. Only PD has probably been introduced from Eurasia to North America along with
their vectors (Jarausch and Jarausch, 2010). Although the relationship between these
phytoplasmas, their hosts and the vectoring psyllids is almost highly specific, there are
some interconnections and biological factors which influence disease epidemiology,
and vector ecology and which should be taken into consideration for risk assessment
and vector control. For instance, a psyllid species can be a proven vector in one region
or country, but not in one neighbouring, because populations are genetically different; a
Cacopsylla species can even split into two different subspecies with potentially opposed
characters regarding phytoplasma transmission capacities. Furthermore, a vector may
transmit only a particular phytoplasma strain or subtype but not another. Apple proliferation is one of the most economically important phytoplasma disease
on apple in Europe (Seemiiller et a/., 2011). Its agent, ‘Ca. P. mali, has been listed
A2 quarantine pest by EPPO since 1992. A systematic review showed that AP has
been detected in most EU countries where apple is grown commercially (MacLeod
et al., 2012). The disease has been reported from most western, southern and central
European countries. Outside the EU, AP was found in the Balkan states (Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia), Turkey, Moldova, Switzerland, and Ukraine. The northern limit of its distribution is Norway (for review MacLeod et a/., 2012). Two psyllids, Cacopsylla picta (Foerster, 1848) (syn. C. costalis) and Cacopsylla
melanoneura (Foerster, 1848) are recognized vectors of ‘Ca. P, mali’ (Frisinghelli e
al., 2000; Jarausch et al., 2003; Tedeschi et al., 2002). C. picta is distributed only in
Europe (Ouvrard, 2014) and is monophagous on Malus spp. The insect completes
one generation per year and aestivates, then hibernates, as adult on conifers (Mayer
and Gross, 2007; Mattedi e¢ a/., 2008). At the end of winter (March/April), C. picta

112

Diseases and insect vectors

remigrates from the overwintering sites to apple trees for oviposition. C. melanoneura
has a similar life cycle as C. picta but the overwintered adults reappear earlier in the year,
and the new generation leaves its host plant earlier than C. picta to its aestivation and
overwintering habitats (Mattedi et a/., 2008; Tedeschi et a/., 2002; 2009). A significant
difference is that the principal host plant of C. melanoneura is not apple but Crataegus
monogyna (hawthorn), a common shrub. C. melanoneura has a Palaearctic distribution
(Ouvrard, 2014) and is oligophagous on Rosaceae. In most of the studied areas both
species are present (Jarausch et al., 2003; Delic et al., 2005; Carraro et al., 2008; Mattedi
et al., 2008), in others so far only C. melanoneura has been found on apple (Tedeschi et
al., 2002). Jarausch et al. (2011) found that ‘Ca. P. mali’ multiplies very rapidly in its vector C.
picta so that newly hatched individuals can become infective within two weeks, and are
able to transmit the disease inside the orchard in the same season indicating a polycyclic
pathosystem with two main transmission periods. Comprehensive studies on the vector capacity of C. picta and C. melanoneura and
on the role of hawthorn as source of ‘Cz. P. mali’ in different European regions led to
contradictory results. Thus, C. picta has been proven main vector of ‘Ca. P. mali’ in
Germany (Jarausch e¢ a/., 2003; 2011) and northern Italy (Frisinghelli e¢ a/., 2000;
Carraro et al., 2008). In contrast, C. melanoneura was identified as main vector in Aosta
Valley (Tedeschi e¢ a/., 2002) whereas in Germany C. melanoneura has been proven to be
non-vector for ‘Ca. P. mali’ (Mayer e¢ a/., 2009). Furthermore, the German population
preferred hawthorn as host plant which, however, was not found infected with the
phytoplasma, whereas the north western Italian population seems to be able to move
between apple and hawthorn. Accordingly, hawthorn has been found infected with ‘Ca. P. mali’ and, thus, may play arole in the epidemiology of AP in this region (‘Tedeschi etal,
2009). On the contrary, recent ecological and genetic results indicate a differentiation
between C. melanoneura populations associated with apple and hawthorn in Trentino,
showing no significant exchange between these host plants (Malagnini e¢ a/., 2013). The role of hawthorn as inoculum source of AP is still unclear. European stone fruit yellows is an economically important disease on several cultivated
Prunus spp. (e.g. apricot, peach, Japanese plums) in Europe (Marcone ef al., 2010;
2011). Infected trees may completely die off from one year to the other. Its agent, ‘Ca. P. prunorum; is native to Europe and is not qualified as a quarantine pest by EPPO or
EFSA (MacLeod er al, 2012). The phytoplasma disease can be found in 14 of the 27 EU
countries. ESFY has been reported from most southern and central European countries,
with its northern limit in south-east England (Kent) and northern Germany (Schleswig
Holstein). Outside Europe, ESFY has been found in the Balkan States, Turkey, Ukraine
and most recently in Azerbaijan (MacLeod ef al., 2012; Steffek et al., 2012). The only described vector of ‘Cz. P. prunorum’ in various European countries was
until recently the psyllid Cacospylla pruni (Scopoli, 1763), an oligophagous species
on Prunus (Carraro et al., 1998). C. pruni was considered as an European and Central

113

Chapter 3

Asian species that was known from almost all of Europe (Ouvrard, 2014). Sauvion et al. (2007; 2009) found indications for the existence of two genetically well differentiated
groups of C. pruni by microsatellite genotyping. Recently, they demonstrated that C.
pruni is in fact a complex of two cryptic species (Peccoud et al, 2013), one (A) with a
climatic preference for the regions with sweet winters in west of Europe, and the other
(B) widespread in Europe. The two species are morphologically very similar but specific
PCR primers allowed rapid assignment of C. pruni individuals (Peccoud et al, 2013). Both species are able to transmit ‘Ca. P. prunorum. Indeed, the insects used by
Thébaud et al. (2009) were a mixture of individuals A and B. The natural infection
rate and the transmission capacity of C. pruni seemed vary stunningly. For instance,
low natural infection rates of 1-3% were reported from Germany (Jarausch e¢ al., 2007;
2008) or France (Thébaud ef al, 2009), while ten times higher natural infection and
important transmission rates were described by Carraro ef al. (2004) in North eastern
Italy. Analyses of a collection of 500 European populations of C. pruni A or B gave
first indications for different transmission capabilities of the two C. pruni groups (N.
Sauvion, unpublished). The biological cycles of the two species are identical. The psyllids
migrate between conifers in mountainous regions where they aestivate and overwinter,
and Prunus spp. (especially wild Prunus like blackthorn) at lower altitude where they
breed (Jarausch and Jarausch, 2010). Thébaud et al. (2009) showed that C. pruni needs
along effective latency period of 8 months for multiplication and transmission of ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ From this transmission cycle, they infer that local secondary spread of ESFY
in apricot orchards is marginal (contrary to the polycyclic spread of AP by C. picta), and
suggested disease management strategies at a regional scale, respecting the role of wild
Prunus spp. in ESFY epidemics. Pear decline (PD) is one of the most important diseases of pear and induces a more
or less quick decline of the tree (Seemiiller et a/., 201 1a). A decline-like disorder called
‘moria del pero’ has already been reported in Italy around 1950. In North America, PD
was first described in British Columbia (1948) and spread then along the Pacific Coast. Devastating epidemics of PD were observed in the 1950s and 1960s along the Pacific
coast of North America and in Italy (Jarausch and Jarausch, 2010). Its agent ‘Ca. P. pyr? is listed A2 quarantine pest by EPPO since 1978, and is also of quarantine significance
for COSAVE (South America). The phytoplasma disease can be found in 15 of the 27 EU countries (MacLeod et
al., 2012). During the WG2 questionnaire survey, PD has been reported from most
southern and central European countries, with its northern limit in south-east England
and northern Germany. Outside of the EU and USA, PD has been found in Albania,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Kosovo, Turkey and Switzerland as well as in
Canada, Iran, Lebanon and Libya (for review MacLeod et al., 2012). Seven distinct west Palaeartic Pyrus-feeding psyllid species have been described by
Burckhardt and Hodinkinson (1986). They considered this group as problematic: “(it)
is a complex of related but distinct species with overlapping geographical distributions. 114

Diseases and insect vectors

Entomologists have usually applied names pyri or pyricola to all members of the complex
and have failed to recognize morphological and biological differences between the
species. Therefore, the literature concerning these species should be considered with
a particular attention. A pictorial key supplemented with a dichotomous key is now
available on web for the identification of the central European psyllids of the genus
Cacopsylla which develop on Rosaceae, in particular Pyrus-feeding psyllid species, that
should minimize the risk of misidentification” (http://www.psyllidkey.com). Cacopsylla pyri (Linné, 1758) and Cacopsylla pyricola (Foerster, 1848) have been described
as vectors of ‘Ca. P. pyri: C. pyri is reported from Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the
Russian far east and China, while C. pyricola naturally occurs in the western palaearctics
and has been introduced into the USA and Canada in the early 19% century. The two
species are oligophagous on Pyrus species such as 2 communis, P eleagrifolia, P. pyraster,
P. amygdaliformis and P. salicifolia where they produce several generations per year, while
C. pyrisuga is univoltine; the adults overwinter on conifers and remigrate to Pyrus by
middle March to April. C. pyricola has been described as vector of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ only for
Great Britain (Davies et al., 1992) and North America (Jensen ef al,,1964), while C. pyri
was described as the vector in France (Lemoine, 1984), Italy (Carraro et al., 1998a) and
Spain (Garcia-Chapa e¢ a/., 2005). Presentations during the COST meetings showed
that individuals of C. pyricola and Cacopsylla pyrisuga (Foerster, 1848) have been found
naturally infected with ‘Ca. P. pyri’ (e.g. Austria, Italy, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Croatia,
Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Poland, Romania Slovenia, and the Netherlands),
but their vector capability has not yet been proven by transmission trials. Grapevine yellows and their vectors

‘Two grapevine yellows due to phytoplasma infection are mainly affecting the European
vineyards. Both agents at the origin of these diseases are listed as A2/EPPO quarantine
pests. They are spread by sap feeding hemipteran insect vectors and to some extent by
exchanges of infected planting material from grapevine nurseries. Present knowledge on
the etiology and epidemiology of these grapevine yellows has been recently reviewed
(Constable, 2010; Belli e¢ a/., 2010). Three strains of “flavescence dorée” (FD) phytoplasma are mainly spread from grapevine
to grapevine, but surrounding wild Vitis regrowth, infected alders and Clematis may
constitute potential epidemic reservoir. The genetic diversity of FD phytoplasmas has
extensively been studied. It appeared that three main genetic clusters of FD phytoplasmas
are present in Europe (Martini et a/., 1999; 2002; Arnaud eg a/., 2007). In France, the
genetic cluster mapFD2 is clonal and represents 85% of the disease cases, whereas the
cluster mapFD1 only represents 15% of the FD cases and is mainly detected in south-
western France (Salar ef a/., 2009). In Italy, mapFD3 strains (also called FD-C strains) are
detected in addition to mapFD2 (also called FD-D strains) and mapFD1 strains (mostly
present in north-western Italy and called FD-C/Piedmont strains). In north-eastern

115

Chapter 3

regions of Italy and in Slovenia mapFD3 strains are usually more abundant than mapFD2
strains. In Serbia, only mapFD3 strains have up to now been detected. In northern Spain,
Portugal and Switzerland only the mapFD2 strains have been detected so far. The leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus (Ball, 1932), an insect of North American origin, is
an efficient vector of FD phytoplasma (Schvester et al., 1961; Mori et al., 2002). Since
its introduction in Europe certainly in south-western France (Papura et a/., 2012), it
has expanded its geographic distribution and represents an important risk factor for
FD spreading. Its current distribution ranges from south Italy to Hungary, and from
Portugal to Romania. If the vector is of North American origin, the FD phytoplasma
is widespread in alders (Alnus glutinosa) in south-western France (Malembic-Maher et
al. 2007), but also all over Europe. Sixty to eighty percent of the alders are healthy
carriers of the phytoplasma. More than 140 map genotypes have been detected in A.
glutinosa in France, Italy, Germany, Serbia and Hungary, including the three mapFD1,
mapFD2 and mapFD3 clusters. Transmission from alder to alder is achieved by Oncopsis
alni (Maixner and Reinert, 1999), which occasionally transmits the phytoplasma
to grapevine (Maixner ef a/., 2000). In Italy and Serbia, mapFD3 strains are present
in wild clematis (Clematis vitalba) from which they can be transmitted to grapevine
by Dictyophara europea (Filippin et al., 2009). The importance of phytoplasma
transmission from alders and clematis to grapevine remains to be determined, but it
cannot provoke a FD outbreak in the absence of the leafhopper S. titanus. In south-
western France, along rivers, uncontrolled rootstock regrowth has shown to constitute
in many places a reservoir for FD phytoplasmas and S. titanus populations escaping the
insecticide treatments. “Bois noir” (BN) is endemic in the Euro-Mediterranean area, and is associated with the
accidental transmission of different “stolbur” phytoplasma strains that are maintained
by epidemiological systems based on different endemic weed species as reservoir plants. BN is associated with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’ presence (Quaglino er al.,
2013). The phytoplasmas are present in the natural vegetation and transmitted from
and to herbaceous plants mainly by planthoppers of the family Cixiidae (Cvrkovic et
al., 2011). Since recently, Hyalesthes obsoletus (Signoret, 1865) was the only species
known to transmit BN by occasional feeding on grapevine. However, it does not
acquire phytoplasmas from infected grapevines. Instead, the root feeding nymphs
acquire the pathogen from herbaceous host plants (nettle and bindweed). Where other
vector species are probably involved in BN transmission, e.g. in south-eastern Europe
(Cvrkovic et a/., 2011), their vector status and their life history need to be investigated
carefully as a prerequisite for appropriate risk analysis as well as effective control of BN. Recent progress was made with the demonstration that Reptalus panzeri (Low, 1883) is
a BN vector in Serbia (Cvrkovi¢ ef a/,, 2013). BN is considered the result of an occasional branching of the natural transmission cycles
to grapevine as a dead end host for the pathogen. Spread of BN is less epidemic than the
one of FD and not affected by infected grapevine presence in the vineyard. Typical for

116

Diseases and insect vectors

BN are long term fluctuations of disease incidence, with short epidemic outbreaks and
decreasing disease levels during endemic stretches. The genetic variability of BN strains is high and exhibits geographic patterns (Pacifico et
al, 2009; Quaglino et al., 2009; Fabre et al., 2011; 201 1a; Johannesen et al., 2012). Most
important for the epidemiology of BN is that genetic diversity could be linked to plant
host specificity. The variability of the suf gene is diagnostic for the host plant association
of BN strains (Langer and Maixner, 2004), since tuf-type a strains are specific to nettle,
while tuf-type b strains are typical for bindweed, though associated with other weeds,
too. In addition, populations of H. obsoletus from nettle and bindweed exhibit signs
of adaptation to their respective host plants, e.g. differences in phenology or survival
(Cargnus et al., 2012; Johannesen et al., 2011; Maixner, 2007). Genetically distinct host
races of H. obsoletus have been identified in central Europe (Imo ef al., 2013). The host
affiliation of “stolbur” strains and vector populations results in distinct epidemiologic
cycles based on the different plant host species. This implies the risk that new plant/
vector or plant/“stolbur”-strain combinations could result in altered disease cycles and
changing infection pressure to grapevine. Possible reasons for such changes include
altering environmental conditions or cultural practice, host plant shift of phytoplasmas
or insect vectors, and their range extension or dissemination. The phenomenon of the
recent severe outbreaks of the nettle type (tuf-type a) of BN in central Europe was likely
the result of the host shift of local populations of H. obsoletus from bindweed to nettle
in combination with the range extension of Italian populations and associated tuf-type
astrains to the north (Johannesen eg a/., 2012). The nature of BN epidemiology with grapevine being just an accidental host prevents
epidemic outbreaks on the one hand, but impedes effective disease control on the other
hand, since reservoir plants and vectors are common in the natural vegetation and
not restricted to vineyards. Detailed information about the elements involved in local
disease spread (predominant host plants, vector species, “stolbur” strains) is necessary to
set up selective control measures. References

Abstract

Apple proliferation and pear decline diseases associated with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’
and ‘Cz. P. pyri} respectively have an increasing importance for fruit growing production in
Romania. During 2012, samples from different apple and pear varieties and from insects
were collected from four fruit production regions in the southern and northern parts of
Romania to test for phytoplasma presence. Shoots proliferation and enlarged stipules were
observed on some of the apple trees whereas some pear trees showed premature foliage
reddening, Universal primer pair P1/P7 followed by F1/B6 primers as well as primers fAT/
AS specific for apple proliferation phytoplasma group were used for amplification of 16S
rRNA gene. Phytoplasmas were detected in 8 out of 35 apple and four out of 11 pear samples. Two restriction patterns were obtained on PCR products amplified with F1/B6 primers
and digested with Hpall, Msel and Sspl enzymes, No phytoplasmas were detected in insect
samples. This is the first report on molecular characterization of ‘Ca. P. mali’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri’
strais found in Romania. Key words: apple proliferation, pear disease, phytoplasma, PCR-RELP identification. Introduction

“Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’ (‘Ca. P. mali’) and ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’
(‘Ca. P. pyri’) (Seemiiller and Schneider, 2004) are agents associated with the apple
proliferation (AP) and pear decline (PD), respectively, serious diseases of fruit trees. Both phytoplasmas are closely related each other and together with ‘Ca. P. prunorum’
belong to the apple proliferation group, 16SrX (Lee et al., 1998; Seemiiller et al., 1998). ‘Ca. P. mali’ is classified in subgroup-A and ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in subgroup-C of 16SrX group. AP and PD are widespread in many European countries. Moreover, the presence of PD
was also confirmed in north Africa and Asia (Ben Khalifa et a/., 2007; Liu e¢ al, 2007). ‘Ca. P. mali’ is transmitted mainly by Cacopsylla picta Forster (Frisinghelli et a/., 2000;
Jarausch et al., 2003) and C. melanoneura Forster (Tedeschi and Alma, 2004). It was
reported that Fieberiella florii Stal (Krezal et al., 1988; Tedeschi and Alma, 2004) play
also role in the spreading of this agent. ’Cz. P. pyri’ is transmitted by C. pyri L. (Carraro
et al., 1998; Caglayan et al., 2010) in continental Europe and Turkey and by C. pyricola
(Davies et al, 1992) in the UK and in North America (Hibino et al, 1971). 122

Diseases and insect vectors

The affected trees display different symptoms which can be observed earlier in the season
and are more pronounced during summer and autumn. Witches’ broom symptom
resulting through the abnormal development of axillary buds, small leaves with enlarged
stipules, delayed flowering, flowers with numerous petals, small fruits with incomplete
coloration and lacking in flavor and premature foliage reddening are generally associated
with AP in apple trees (EPPO, 2006). Symptoms associated with pear decline disease
develop along slow or quick decline of trees. Quick decline symptoms include a rapid
wilting of leaves and fruits that culminate shortly with death of trees, while the slow
decline is a progressive weakening of trees, in which the curl leaves, premature reddening
and falling of the leaves are the most common symptoms (EPPO, 2006). The apple proliferation disease has been occurring in Romania for a long time. Symptoms characteristic for AP were observed on wild apple trees and in apple orchards
in central part of Romania in fifties and sixties of the last century. The first dataon AP
phytoplasma detection in the phloem elements of apple trees, symptomatology as well
as its distribution in different regions of the country and economical importance and
control were reported by Gheorghiu (1975). The disease incidence was assessed on 37%
in intensive and 22% in traditional orchards. Pear decline symptoms in central part of Romania were firstly described by Balagcuta
et al. (1979) and Minoiu and Ionica (1991). Over the last decades, Ploaie et al. (2006;
2008) brought new contributions to research on fruit trees phytoplasmas. Apple and
pear production is economically important in Romania, therefore the phytoplasmas are
subjected to the official control of Phytosanitary Regulations that complies with the
European standards. Due to the diversity of AP and PD symptoms in different fruit
growing regions and difficulties with detection of their agents, the molecular tools
becomes obligatory to control both of these phytoplasmas. The aim of this work was the detection and molecular characterization of the
phytoplasmas infecting apple and pear trees in Romania, based on the 16S rDNA and
the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region analysis. Material and methods

Field survey and samples collection

During autumn 2012, shoot and leaf samples of symptomatic and asymptomatic apple
and pear trees growing in seven commercial and experimental orchards located in four
geographic regions (Dambovita, Arges and Bistrita-Nasaud Counties and Bucharest) of
southern and northern parts of Romania were collected and tested for the presence of
phytoplasmas. Samples from single apple and pear trees growing in abandoned orchard
in Bucharest were also included. Apple trees showed shoots proliferation (witches’
broom), small leaves with enlarged stipules and rosettes, whereas curled leaves and
their premature reddening were observed on pear trees. Psyllids in spring time and

123

leafhoppers in autumn were caught by beating on apple trees in Bucharest. A total of
35 apple samples from 12 cultivars, 11 pear sample from six pear cultivars and 10 insect
samples of three species were tested for phytoplasma presence (Table 1). Table 1. Results of phytoplasma detection in apple and pear samples collected in 2012 in different regions of Romania. Location Sample Plant species/varieties/insects* Symptoms PCR results

DNA extraction

Total DNAs were extracted from 1 g of fresh leaf midribs using a modified CTAB method
(Maixner ef al., 1995) and dissolved in 100 ul TE 1X buffer. The DNA from batch
of 1-5 insects were extracted by InnuPrep Plant DNA commercial kit (AnalytikJena,
Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA extracts from phloem tissue of apple and leaf midribs of Catharanthus roseus
infected with AP-15 subtype, kindly provided by M. Cieslitiska as well as DNA from
healthy plant were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Identification of phytoplasmas by PCR-RFLP analysis

Total DNA templates were subjected to PCR using two sets of universal phytoplasma
primers P1/P7 (Dengand Hiruki, 1991; Schneider etal., 1995) followed by F1/B6 (Davis
and Lee, 1993; Padovan et al., 1995) or RIGF2n/R16R2 (Gundersen and Lee, 1996) to
amplify the 16S rDNA fragment. Additionally, direct PCR assays were conducted with
universal primers fUS/rU3 (Lorenz et al, 1995) as well as primer pair fAT/rAS (Smart
et al, 1993) specific for AP ribosomal group. The PCR reactions were carried out in a
Thermocycler PTC-200 (MJ Research, USA) and 10 ul of the amplification products
were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gel followed by staining in ethidium
bromide; DNA bands were visualized in an UVi-Tec transilluminator (Syngen, USA). The molecular weight of the products was estimated by comparison with a 100 bp DNA
ladder (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). To distinguish the apple proliferation subgroups in the Romanian phytoplasma strains
on the basis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns, the nested-
PCR products amplified using primers F1/B6 were digested with the enzymes Msel,
pall and Sspl (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) following manufacturer's instructions. The DNA fragments were separated on 2.5% agarose gel in 0.5% TBE buffer, stained

with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV transillumination. The RFLP profiles
were compared to the patterns of reference strains and to the previously published ones
(Lee ef al., 1998; Paltrinieri et al, 2010). Results

The results of PCRs performed with specific primers fAT/rAS showed that 8 out of 35
apple and 4 out of 11 pear samples were infected with phytoplasmas belonging to apple
proliferation group (Table 1). The presence of AP phytoplasma was identified in DNAs
from symptomatic plants and from positive control. No phytoplasmas were detected in
insect samples, samples from asymptomatic trees and healthy control. RELP analyses of nested PCR products amplified with F1/B6 primers and digested
with Msel and Sspl, showed that all infected apple samples gave the restriction patterns
characteristic for ‘Ca. P. mali’ classified to the subgroup 16SrX-A (apple proliferation
ribosomal group). 16S rDNA fragments from pear samples after digestion with the same
enzymes showed profiles referable to those of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ (16SrX-C) (Figure 1). In turn,
the RFLP analyses on F1/B6 amplicons digested with HpaII showed two restriction
profiles: P-I and P-II (Figure 1, Table 2). The P-I profile was detected in majority of ‘Ca. P. mali’ strains (Figure 1, Table 2). “Ca. P. mali’ was present in 23.5% of tested apple samples whereas about 40% of pear
samples were infected with ‘Ca. P. pyri. The presence of phytoplasmas was not confirmed
in the insect samples from apple, but further study is required, especially considering
that most of the insect species involved in spreading of fruit trees phytoplasmas were
already identified in Romanian orchards. The apple proliferation phytoplasma was
detected in cultivars Golden Delicious, Iris and Generos in all surveyed locations:
Dambovita, Arges, Bucharest and B. Nasaud (Table 1). The most affected cultivar was
Golden Delicious which is the second most important in apple production in Romania
covering about 20% of apple growing area (NIS, 2013). Pear of the cultivars Williams,
Conference and unknown cultivars found in abandoned orchard in Bucharest were also
infected by phytoplasmas. Hpall Msel Sspl

Discussion

In Romania, typical symptoms of phytoplasma diseases were observed on apple trees
in the 1960s (Gheorghiu, 1975) and on pear trees in the 1970s (Balascuta et al., 1979)
respectivelly, but until now their associated phytoplasmas were not identified. The
RFLP analysis revealed the presence of two distinct phytoplasmas: ‘Cz. P. mali’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in apple and pear samples, respectively. Two different profiles, P-I and P-II were
generated after Hpall-digestion of PCR products amplified with F1/B6 primers. Both
of these profiles were also obtained for ‘Ca. P. mali’ strains from Italy, Hungary and
Serbia (Casati et al., 2010; Paltrinieri et a/., 2010), Poland (Ciesliniska e¢ a/., 2012) and
the Czech Republic (Franova et al., 2013). The profile P-I was detected in the majority
of apple from Romania whereas the P-II profile was detected only in three apple isolates
from Bucharest and B, Nasaud. This is the first report on identification of ‘Ca. P. mali’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in Romania and
characterization the strains of the both phytoplasmas based on molecular methods. Acknowledgments

Abstract
‘The most studied phytoplasma diseases in Turkey are European stone fruit yellows (ESFY)
and pear decline (PD). Results of a survey catried out by PCR/RELP analysis on samples
from more than 500 cultivated and wild Prunus, 116 pear and some symptomatic apple,
pomegranate, persimmon (kaki) and olive samples are reported. ESFY and PD were the
most common phytoplasmas in both germplasm and commercial orchards. However, also
“Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’ was detected in different regions of Turkey, its incidence was
much lower compared to other 16SrX group phytoplasmas. Many overwintered individuals
of Cacopsylla pruni were collected from Abies sp. and Pinus spp., and were molecularly typed
as B. DNAs of individual psyllid species of C. pruni and C. pyriwere analysed and the presence
of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri’ was confirmed, respectively. As potential vectors of
“Ca. P. mali’ C. picta, C. affinis, and C. melanoneura were teported. Healthy pear and plum
plants were inoculated by ‘Ca. P. pyri’ and ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ by using C. pruni and C. pyri,

 

respectively. Experimental transmission trials of ‘Ca. P. mali’ are in progress. Key words: stone and pome fruits, PCR/RELP, phycoplasmas, Cacopsylla spp. Introduction

With the exception of some tropical fruits, almost all the fruit species can be grown
in Turkey. In the world there are about 138 fruit species, and out of these 75 can be
grown in Turkey that is the leader of production in apricot, hazelnut and sweet cherry
in the world (Anil, 2001; Asma, 2007). Although fruit tree phytoplasmas have been
studied since 1999, most reports were on symptomatologic, microscopic and molecular
characterization of European stone fruit yellows (ESFY), pear decline (PD) and
apple proliferation (AP) diseases and on their epidemiology (Caglayan et al., 2011). First symptomatologic observations on ESFY was reported by Caglayan and Gazel
(1999) and then molecular detection of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ (ESFY)
on Japanese plum (Prunus salicina) in Izmir (Jaraush et a/., 2000) and on apricot in
Mersin province (Caglayan et al., 2004) were reported. In the following years ESFY was
detected on almond, myrabolan, plum and peach trees (Sertkaya et a/., 2005), and then
it was first time reported on germplasm orchards located in different part of Turkey

with a high infection rate as 54.8% (Ulubasg Serge er a/., 2006). Responses of the Turkish
apricot cultivar Tokaloglu, Alkayts1, $ekerpare, Karacabey and Hacthaliloglu to ‘Cz. P.
prunorum’ presence under greenhouse conditions were studied and all tested plants
resulted susceptible to ESFY (Ulubas Serge et al., 2007). “Ca. P. prunorum’ causes economic losses on apricot and plums in Turkey. The pathogens
negatively affects the cultivar Precoce de Tyrinthe apricot for both yield (decreased
to 77%) and pomologic characteristics in different ratios (Gazel er al., 2009). ‘Ca. P.
prunorum has recently been detected on almonds in Canakkale province (Caglayan et
al., 2011) and new cooperations with other Mediterranean countries were established
for the large scale surveying for almond witches’ broom disease not yet detected in
Turkey. Recently phytoplasma-like symptoms were observed on cherries, pomegranate,
persimmon (kaki) and also olives. The main symptoms on cherries were proliferation
of branches, off-season flowering and declining, whereas yellowing and reddening were
the main symptoms on pomegranate, kaki and olives. Survey results for some fruit tree phytoplasmas and their potential vectors are
summarized here. Phytoplasma diseases in stone fruit trees

ESFY was detected in apricot, plum and almond trees. Main symptoms were yellowing,
longitudinal leaf rolling, early bud break and off season flowering, on apricots; quick
dieback on plums; late bud-break on some branches, leaf drops and proliferation on
almonds (Figure 1). The results of ESFY survey studies by PCR/RELP analyses between 2002-2009 are
summarized in Table 1. Figure 1. Symptoms of European stone fruit yellows on apricot (A), plum (B) and almond (C) plants. 131

Diseases and insect vectors

Highest infection rate detected by PCR/RFLP analyses was found in apricot (12.65%),
followed by plum (11.60%), almond (5.74%) and peach (2.43%) trees. No phytoplasma
was found in wild Prunus species (Figures 2 and 3). Recently phytoplasma-like symptoms were observed on cherries. Symptomatic cherry
trees showing proliferation of branches, off season and abnormal flowering, and
declining were sampled and, when tested by nested PCR, resulted positive (7 out of
the 15 symptomatic samples tested) (Figure 4). RFLP analyses of 16R758f/16R1232r
(=M1/M2) amplicons (Gibb e¢ al, 1995) showed identical restriction profiles
referable to aster yellows. One of these samples was sequenced in both direction after
amplification with primers R16(I)F1/R1 and the sequence showed a 99% identity
with 16S rDNA from phytoplasmas related to aster yellows group (‘Cz. P. asteris’). The
sequence obtained was deposited in Genbank under the accession number KF476062
(Gaglayan et al., 2013). Phytoplasma diseases in pome fruit trees

The first suspicious symptoms for the presence of PD in Bursa province, located in
Marmara Region of Turkey, were observed in 2005. The main symptoms observed in pear
orchards were small, leathery leaves with up-rolled margins, leaves become abnormally
red in the autumn and drop prematurely (Figure 5). The presence of PD was confirmed
by PCR/RFLP analyses in Bursa samples (Ulubas Serce et a/., 2006) and in one sample
in the east Mediterranean region of Turkey (Sertkaya e¢ a/., 2005). An extensive survey
was conducted for estimating PD spread in Bursa province in 2006. Out of the 116
tested pear samples, 52.58% was found to be infected. The incidence of the disease in
tested Deveci, Santa Maria, Comice and William pear cultivars was detected as 58.06%,
48.57%, 44.44% and 40%, respectively. RFLP profiles obtained using of Rsal, and SspI
restriction enzymes on amplicons from nested PCR with R16F2n/R2 primer pair,
showed that phytoplasmas belong to 16SrX group (Gazel et al., 2007). Figure 5. Reddening of pear trees cultivar Deveci in autumn due to pear decline disease. 133

Apple proliferation disease has been not as widespread as ESFY and PD in Turkey. First
molecular characterization of ‘Ca. P. mali’ was reported by Canik and Ertung (2007)
and then by Dagtekin (2009). The typical symptoms of infected trees were autumn,
blossom, rosette growing of shoots and sometimes enlarged stipules (Figure 6). Most
of the apple trees found infected by ‘Cz. P. mali’ was symptomless (K. Caglayan ef al.,
unpublished data). According to surveys in central and west Mediterranean regions, out of 201 samples, 8
samples from cultivars Starkrimson, Krimson, Starking, Granysmith and Gloster gave
positive results by using PCR/RFLP analyses. The results up to date showed that AP
disease in Turkey has only been detected in limited locations and the local cultivars are
free from the disease. Phytoplasma diseases in other fruit trees

Recently phytoplasma-like symptoms, mainly yellowing and reddening, were observed
on pomegranate, persimmon (kaki) and olives (Figure 7). Although all symptomatic
samples gave positive results by using universal phytoplasma primers P1/P7 followed by
RIGF2n/R2, phytoplasma characterization studies are still in progress. |

Vector studies

Seventeen localities from seven provinces, where apricot, peach and plum growing is
economically important in Turkey, were selected for surveys of C. pruni presence carried
out during the springs 2010-2011. Psyllids were collected from wild (e.g. 2 spinosa, P
ceracifera) or cultivated Prunus species and conifers. C. pruni was collected in provinces
in which ‘Ca. P. prunorum infections have been recorded in previous researches and the
psyllid was found in both overwintered hosts (Abies sp.) and Prunus hosts (Serge et al.,
2012). Phytoplasma infected remigrants of C. pruni were detected in considerably high
numbers. This situation clearly revealed the potential spread risk of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’
by C. pruni in Turkey and the necessity of taking precautions. Molecular typing based
on COI genes and an ITS region indicated that all C. pruni individuals were from the
ecotype B. ‘Ca. P. pyri? was detected by PCR/RELP analyses in C. pyri individuals, from
symptomatic pear orchards. Potential vectors of ‘Cz. P. mali’ were also collected from
hawthorn and apple trees in different provinces; C. picta, C. affinis and C. melanoneura
were identified. Healthy pear and plum plants were inoculated with ‘Ca. P. pyri’ and ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ by using C. pruni and C. pyri, respectively (Serge ef al., 2012; K. Caglayan
et al. unpublished data). Experimental transmission trials of ‘Cz. P. mali’ is in progress. References

Abstract

The survey of the health status of azaleas and rhododendrons on production areas in the
Czech Republic started in 2006, Symptoms of unknown aetiology on Rhododendron
bybridum cultivar Cunningham's White were observed in 2010. The infected plant had
malformed leaves, with irregular shaped edges, mosaic, leaf tip necrosis and multiple axillary
shoots with smaller leaves, Transmission electron microscopy showed phytoplasma-like
bodies in phloem cells of the symptomatic plant. Phytoplasma presence was confirmed by
polymerase chain reaction using phytoplasma-specific, universal and group specific primer
pairs. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 165 rDNA enabled classification
of the detected phytoplasma in the aster yellows subgroup 16SrlI-C. Sequence analysis of the
16-235 ribosomal operon of the amplified phytoplasma from the infected rhododendron
plane (1,724 bp) confirmed the closest relationship with the Czech Echinacea purpurea
phyllody phytoplasma. These data suggest Rhododendron hybridum as new host for the aster
yellows phytoplasma subgroup 16Srl-C in the Czech Republic and worldwide. Usinga nested
PCR assay, phytoplasmas belonging to aster yellows group were detected in two azalea bushes. Mosaic and yellowing were the main symptoms of the disease. Key words: Czech Republic, electron microscopy, PCR, phytoplasma, sequencing. Introduction

Rhododendron sp. is a favorite shrub, often evergreen, that is grown worldwide as a
garden or potted ornamental plant, especially for showy flowers. A phytoplasma disease
of Rhododendron sp. plants was first observed in Ukraine in azalea showing symptoms
of yellowing (Onishchenko et a/., 1988). Rhododendron plants with symptoms of leaf
malformation and variegation were observed in the Czech Republic in 1997. “Stolbur”-
type phytoplasmas were detected using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses (Mertelik et
al.,2006). The natural occurrence of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma trifolii’ in Rhododendron
hybridum plants was revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and PCR/
RELP analysis (Ptibylova et a/., 2009). A phytoplasma associated with little leaf disease
in azalea was detected in China; based upon results from RFLP analysis of multiple
loci, this phytoplasma, named azalea little leaf (AzLL), was enclosed in a new 16Sr1-T
subgroup, in the aster yellows phytoplasma group (Wei et a/., 2011). Similarly, symptoms
of witches’ broom disease were observed on Kanehirai azalea (R. kanehirai) in Taiwan,
and phytoplasmas were detected by TEM in sieve elements (Wang, 1994). 137

Material and methods

A plant of Rhododendron hybridum cultivar Cunningham’s White with unusual
symptoms was found in a germplasm collection of rhododendron in central Bohemia
in May 2010. This plant exhibited malformed leaves with irregular edges, showing
also mosaic and leaf tip necrosis, leading to rolled and fragile leaves. Axillary shoots
with smaller leaves were also present (Figures la and b). The symptomatic plant
(approximately 20 cm in height) was taken from the field, replanted and maintained
under glasshouse conditions for further tests. An asymptomatic rhododendron plant
was taken as a negative control. Previously identified phytoplasmas maintained in
periwinkle plants (Catharanthus roseus) served as positive controls: aster yellows
subgroups 16SrI-B (Ptibylové et a/.,2001) and 16StI-C (clover phyllody) (Frénovaeral.,
2004). Samples of midribs from symptomatic leaves of the diseased and asymptomatic
plants were examined with TEM. DNA was extracted from midribs of both asymptomatic and symptomatic plants,
and from leaves of positive controls. A healthy C. rosezs plant (raised from seed) was
used as negative control. A chloroform/phenol method followed by isopropanol
precipitation was employed for DNA extraction (Lee et al., 1991). In direct PCR
universal, phytoplasma-specific primer pairs P1/P7 (Deng and Hiruki, 1991;
Schneider et a/., 1995) were used for amplification of a 1.8-kbp product and fUS/
1U3 (Lorenz ef al., 1995) yielding a product of approximately 800 bp. In nested PCR
assays group-specific primers R16(I)FI/RI (Lee ef al., 1994) were used. Tubes with
the reaction mixture devoid of DNA template, with DNA from the asymptomatic
rhododendron and from the healthy C. roseus were included in each experiment as
negative controls. b

Diseases and insect vectors

The nested PCR products (1.1 kbp) of phytoplasma 16S rDNA sequence, amplified
with the primer pair R16(I)F1/R1, were subjected to RFLP analysis; 3 ul were digested
overnight at 37°C with the restriction endonuclease Msel (NE Biolabs, Beverly, MA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The digest was resolved on an
8% polyacrylamide gel. The approximate molecular weight and size of the resulting
DNA bands were estimated using a 100-bp DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius,
Lithuania). Aset of overlapping PCR products from the symptomatic rhododendron was generated
by amplification with primers P1/U3 and 16R758/P7. PCR products were sequenced
using a BIG DYE sequencing terminator kit (PE Biosystems, Warrington, UK) from
both directions. Sequencing was performed in an ABI PRISM 310 sequencer (PE
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequence was compared with the
phytoplasma sequences available in the GenBank database using the BLASTh network
service available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Multiple
sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTALW (Thompson et a/., 1994). Symptomatic plants of azaleas showing mainly mosaic and yellowing of leaves were also
analyzed. Fourteen selected azalea plants of different cultivars were tested using nested
PCR assays. DNA was extracted from mixed samples of midribs and phloem. PCR
assays were performed with P1/P7 primers for the initial amplification. The diluted
(1: 30) PCR product from the first amplification (1 ul) was used as template in nested
PCR with internal primer pairs R1GF2/R2 (Lee er al., 1995) and FU5/rU3, tests were
carried out in the same way as mentioned above. PCR products amplified with primers RI6F2/R2 were sequenced as above and the
sequences were compared with those in the GenBank database. Results and discussion

Examination of ultrathin cross sections of leaf midribs from symptomatic leaves with a
Jeol 100 MB TEM revealed that some phloem cells of the symptomatic rhododendron
contained irregular ovoid and pleomorphic phytoplasma-like bodies ranging from 60 x
80 nm to 270 x 390 nm in diameter (average 159 x 240 nm). These were present in low
numbers and were scattered within the cells among residual cytoplasm (Figure 2). No
bodies were found in the asymptomatic rhododendron samples. Polymerase chain reaction assays were carried out to detect and identify the phytoplasma. Amplification with the primer pair FUS/rU3 yielded a PCR product of the expected size. The nested PCR assay produced a PCR product of 1.1 kbp with primer pair R16(I)F1/
RI. No PCR products were obtained from the asymptomatic plant and negative controls. When the restriction profile of the PCR product amplified with R16(I)F1/R1 primers
digested with the Msel, was compared with those obtained from the positive controls, the
thododendron-infecting phytoplasma profile was undistinguishable from the profile of
clover phyllody, a member of the ribosomal subgroup 16SrI-C (data not shown). 139

plant (bar = 500 nm). The sequence of 1,724 bp obtained from the phytoplasma infecting the rhododendron
plant was deposited in the GenBank database (accession number KC009838). The
detailed sequence comparison revealed the closest relationship of the rhododendron
phytoplasma with the Czech Echinacea purpurea phyllody phytoplasma (EF546778),
a member of ribosomal subgroup 16SrI-C (Franova ef al., 2009). The two sequences
form a pair slightly different from the 10 closely related sequences (accession numbers
AB551736, AB693125, AB693124, GQ249410, FJ824597, AY566302, AY101386,
AB693126, ABS58132, HQ589186). Twelve differences in sequences were found
between the two sequences mentioned above and these 10 closest sequences available in
GenBank database. The adenine ‘A’ at position 569 complements a restriction site and is
a unique substitution, which discriminates the rhododendron sequence from all others,
including the Czech E. purpurea phyllody phytoplasma. By nested PCR assays, the phytoplasma was detected in two out of fourteen azalea
samples. No visible PCR products were obtained from symptomatic azalea plants with
the P1/P7 primers, and PCR products of 1.2 kbp were amplified by RI6F2/R2 primers. No PCR products were obtained from the negative controls. Comparison of the phytoplasma 168 rDNA sequence obtained from the azalea
cultivar Cecille (1,091 bp) and from an unknown cultivar (1,116 bp) revealed the
closest relationship with members of aster yellows group. Although there were some
differences between the two sequences, clear relationship to aster yellows group was
confirmed. BLAST analysis of these sequences revealed that the 165 rDNA sequence
from cultivar Cecile as well as that from the unknown cultivar shared 99.9% homology
with those of phytoplasmas belonging to 16SrI group (accession numbers HM067755
and KC283218, respectively). 140

Diseases and insect vectors

The rhododendron and azalea plants, like those described in two previous studies
(Pribylova e¢ al., 2009; Mertelik et a/., 2006), originated from a breeding programme
at the Silva Tarouca RILOG Prihonice. The phytoplasma diseases found in the Czech
Republic differed from one another, as they induced different symptoms. Stunting,
yellowing and absence of flowers were the main symptoms of those infected by ‘Ca. P. trifolii’ (Piibylova et al, 2009). The “stolbur”-type rhododendron plants exhibited
leaf malformation and variegation (Mertelik et a/., 2006). The aster yellows type
here described on the rhododendron was characterized by witches’ broom growth,
malformation, mosaic and necrosis of leaves. Throughout three years of observations,
the plant produced no flowers, which was a feature common with the plants infected
by ‘Ca. P. trifolii The aster yellows disease observed on azaleas, inducing mosaic and
yellowing symptoms, originated from the same plantation where later the rhododendron
infected by ‘Ca. P. trifolii’ was found (in 2010). Although the aster yellows group (16SrI), ‘Cz. P. asteris, is the group of phytoplasmas
infecting the widest range of plant hosts wordlwide, the R. hybridum plant infected by a
phytoplasma belonging to the aster yellows subgroup 16Srl-C is the first of its kind ever
found in the Czech Republic or worldwide. Acknowledgements

Abstract
Maize redness (MR) induced by “stolbur” phytoplasma was reported for the first time in 2012
in Semberija region of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition to symptomatic maize plants,
“stolbur” phytoplasma also was identified in johnsongrass plants and in Reptalus panzeri
specimens. Monitoring and sampling in 2013 were extended to Bréko District and Posavina
region. Collected samples were molecularly analyzed for the phytoplasma presence. “Stolbur”
phytoplasma was detected in symptomatic maize plants in all surveyed regions. Key words: “Stolbur” phytoplasma, Semberija, Bréko District, Posavina, corn,

Introduction

Maize redness (MR) is a disease which develops characteristic symptoms of maize
leaf discoloration from mid July until end of August. For 50 years, the disease was a
phenomenon of unknown etiology. The disease symptoms were described and reported
in 1957 in Banat region of Serbia (Mari¢ and Savi, 1965). Main symptoms are central
midrib, leaves and stalk redness, the plants often express abnormal ear development,
cob deformations and maturation disorders. Later symptoms were described in other
regions of Serbia as well as in maize fields of Romania and Bulgaria (Sutié et a/., 2002). In the last two decades of the 1900, MR appeared sporadically with low percentages. However, at the beginning of the 21 century, in fact in 2002 and 2003, MR induced
serious losses in maize production ranging from 40% to 90% in fields of South Banat
region (Bekavac et al., 2011). Figure 1. Map of maize sampling sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 143

Figure 3. MR symptomatic corn plants
| in Semberija region. After the first report of the disease, numerous studies have been conducted with the
aim to determine the causal agent attributed to Fusarium spp., fastidious bacteria or
to the occurrence of abiotic factors such as drought, lack of some micro- or macro-
elements (magnesium, zinc, phosphorus) or even shock-effect due the temperature
change (Bekavac et al., 2011). Nevertheless, in 2006 applying molecular diagnostic tools
“stolbur” phytoplasmas (subgroup 16SrXII-A, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’) were
found to be associated with MR disease in maize plants collected from South Banat

Serbia (Duduk and Bertaccini, 2006). Epidemiological studies in Serbia showed that
cixiid Reptalus panzeri (Léw) isa vector of “stolbur” to maize as well as that johnsongrass
(Sorghum halepense L.) and overwintering wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plays important
role in the disease cycle (Jovié et a/., 2007). Phytoplasma infected adult R. panzeri
emerge in mid June and transmit “stolbur” phytoplasma during feeding. At end of July,
females lay eggs on infected maize roots, and nymphs living on these roots acquire the
phytoplasma from infected maize. Hereafter, the nymphs overwinter on the roots of
johnsongrass and wheat grown into maize fields in the autumn (Jovi¢ et a/., 2009; 2011). So far molecular analyses confirmed presence of “stolbur” phytoplasma associated with
MR disease in Hungary (Acs et al.,2011) and Italy (Calari et al,, 2011). Moreover, in Italy
phytoplasmas belonging to 16Srl (aster yellows) and 16SrIII (X disease) groups were
also identified in MR symptomatic maize (Calari et al., 2010; 2011; Mejia et al., 2013). Considering that maize is an important crop in European regions and the potential
of MR spreading, in 2012 the EPPO Panel on Phytosanitary measures put “stolbur”
phytoplasma associated with maize redness disease to the Alert List (EPPO, 2012). In last five years, MR-like symptoms were observed in Semberija region of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. In 2012, the first survey for the MR agent and vector identification
was conducted. Laboratory analyses showed presence of the “stolbur” phytoplasma
in symptomatic maize plants, johnsongrass and R. panzeri specimens collected from
several locations in Semberija region (Kovacevié er a/., 2014). Since maize production has a significant place in Bosnia and Herzegovina agriculture
in 2013 was carried out an extended survey to verify the disease presence in larger areas. Surveys for maize reddening detection in 2013

Three important centres for maize production (Semberija, Bréko District and
Posavina) were surveyed for the occurrence of reddening symptoms in maize fields
during first week of August 2013. Plants expressing symptoms such as midrib, leaf and
stalk reddening were collected from nineteen sampling sites in northeast Bosnia and
Herzegovina (Figure 1). In addition, in all sampling sites symptomatic plants percentage
was estimated. Maize leaves and roots were sampled from symptomatic plants. All
samples were kept at -20°C until DNA extraction. Detection of “stolbur” phytoplasma in maize

Total DNA extraction

DNA was extracted from MR symptomatic maize plants according to previously
reported modified Dneasy* Plant Mini Kit-a (QIAGEN) protocol (Green ef al.,
1999). Leaf midribs and adventitious roots (0.5-0.6 g) were homogenised in 3%
CTAB buffer (3% CTAB, 100 mM Tris-HCI pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1.4 M NaCl, 3%

145

Chapter 3

polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-40) and 0.2% &-mercaptoethanol). The homogenate (0.5
ml) was transferred to a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube and mixed with RNase (20 mg/
ml) then incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes. Following DNA extraction procedure was
according to the kit manufacturer instructions. Molecular detection of phytoplasma in maize

Extracted nucleic acids were analyzed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification of ribosomal DNA using phytoplasma universal primers. P1 (Deng and
Hiruki, 1991) and P7 (Smart eral., 1996) primer pair was used in direct-PCR procedure. For nested-PCR reaction R16E2n and R16R2 primers (Lee et al,, 1998) were employed. Nested-PCR products in which phytoplasma presence was detected were submitted to
RELP analyses with Rsal (Fermentas) and AluI (BioLabs) restriction enzymes. Digested
products were run with electrophoresis on 2% MetaPhore (Cambrex) agarose gel in
1X TBE buffer. Gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV
transiluminator. For “stolbur” phytoplasma characterization DNAs from infected samples were amplified
in nested-PCR with fTufl/rTufl (in direct-PCR) and fTufAy/rTufAy (nested-PCR)
(Schneider e¢ al., 1997) primer pairs. Nested-PCR products were digested with Hpall
(Fermentas) restriction enzyme. RFLP profiles were observed with electrophoresis in
2% MetaPhore (Cambrex) agarose gel in 1 X TBE buffer. Results of the 2013 survey for maize reddening

In early August 2013, symptoms of maize redness were observed in all three surveyed
regions, but in different percentage. In Bréko district and Posavina regions, MR
symptoms ranged from 10% to 30% (Figure 2). However, the high percentage (40%-
80%) of the symptomatic plants was observed in Semberija region (Figure 3) where MR
appearance in the last three years was epidemic. Nevertheless, most of the plants in the
surveyed fields of Posavina and Bréko were dry because high drought was present during
summer period in 2013. In total 28 samples with MR-like symptoms were sampled for
laboratory analyses. Results of laboratory analyses

Nested-PCR and RFLP analysis of DNAs from the collected maize plants indicated
that 16 out of 28 tested samples (57%) were positive for “stolbur” phytoplasma
(Table 1, Figure 4). Relatively high number of plants with MR-like symptoms showing
absence of phytoplasma infection could be in correlation with various biotic and/or
abiotic unidentified factors. On the other hand, in Bréko District and Posavina regions
monitoring of R. panzeri wasn’t performed, thus it is hard to estimate relationship
of disease severity with presence and number of this possible vector. During the MR

146

Diseases and insect vectors

monitoring in Semberija region in 2012 R. panzeri was found to be abundant in the
maize fields where subsequently high percentage of “stolbur” positive plants were
identified (Kovaéevié ef al, 2013). It is worth to mention that most of the tested maize
plants were quite dry that could influence quality and yield of extracted DNA and lead
to phytoplasma negative results. Table 1. Surveyed locations and presence of “stolbur” phytoplasma in maize in 2013. Phytoplasma

pairs digested with Rsal and Alul restriction enzymes showed restriction profiles
identical to each other, and referable to those of “stolbur” phytoplasma (Figure 4) and
to other members of the 16SrXII group as defined previously (Lee et al, 1998; 1998a). Further molecular characterization of “stolbur” phytoplasma agent of maize redness
disease was performed on elongation factor (tf gene). Restriction analysis carried out
with Hpall endonuclease showed RFLP profiles identical to each other and having a
tuf-type b profile (Figure 5), which is the most common type of “stolbur” phytoplasma
which infects grapevine in Europe (Langer and Maixner, 2004). Intensive wheat/maize crop rotation leads to the increased maize redness disease
incidence because it favors the development of the vector R. panzeri larvae in high
numbers (Jovié et al., 2009). Moreover, stolbur tuf-type b was found to be less host
specific and identified in many herbaceous plants (Belli ef a/., 2010). Therefore several
plant species acts as food hosts for vectors as well as “stolbur” inoculum such as winter
wheat and johnsongrass in the case of MR disease. During surveys in 2012 and 2013 the
highest incidence of MR disease was in fields where maize/wheat crop rotation was a
common agriculture practice. According to this, further studies should be carried out
to identify plants and vector populations source of the “stolbur” phytoplasma in maize
fields in larger area of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, it is possible to speculate
that change of the plants in crop rotation or introduction of three-field rotation could
significantly decrease the disease severity. Figure 5. RFLP analysis of ftufAy/rTufAy PCR products

Abstract

Rubus spp. plants with severe symptoms of stunting, short and thin shoots were observed in
central Poland both in commercial plantations and in natural environments. Shoot samples
were collected from 13 plants of red raspberry, blackberry and hybrids of Rubus spp. The
RELP, sequence and phylogenetic analyses were carried out based on nucleotide sequences of
16S rRNA and sec¥ genes in 11 and 9 detected phytoplasma strains respectively. Most of the
strains were placed in the same clade with the reference strain RuS classified as ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma rubi’ and belonging to the elm yellows group (16SrV). Results of these analyses
also showed that a strain from loganberry belonged to X-disease group (16SrIII) and the
phytoplasma infecting one of the wild blackberry was classified in aster yellows group, 16Sr1
(‘Ca, P, asteris’), The comparative genomic analysis of the secY gene showed that nine Polish
isolates were phylogenetically closely related to each other and to rubus stunt reference strain,

Key words: Rubus sp., phytoplasma, PCR-RELP, sequencing, phylogenetic analysis. Introduction

Poland is one of the leading producers of fruits in Europe and raspberry is one of the most
important species cultivated: its productivity has doubled over the past five years. Fungal
and viral diseases, although varying in expression, severity, and frequency, limit fruit
quality, yield, and stand longevity. Phytoplasma diseases can be other potential threat
for raspberry cultivation as they cause serious damages including stunting, small leaves,
short internodes, enlarged sepals, phyllody, shoot and flower proliferation, and fruit
malformations (van der Meer, 1987; Maurer and Seemiiller, 1994). These diseases are
associated with presence of phytoplasmas belonging to several 16Sr groups: elm yellows
(Marani er al., 1977; Maurer and Seemiiller 1994; Bertaccini et al, 1995; Marcone et
al., 1997; Davies, 2000; Vindimian et al., 2004), X disease (Davies, 2000; Davis et al.,
2001), aster yellows (Borroto Fernandez et al., 2007; Fahmeed et al., 2009; Reeder et al.,
2010) and “stolbur” (Borroto Fernandez e¢ al., 2007, Bobev et al., 2013). ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma rubi’ (Malembic-Maher et a/., 2011), member of the elm yellows group
(16SrV), is the most common phytoplasma detected in Rubus spp. plants. It affects wild
and cultivated raspberry, blackberry, and crosses of these species throughout Europe,
north-eastern USA and Turkey (Maurer and Seemiiller, 1994; Converse et al., 1982,
Davis et al., 2001; Sertkaya et al., 2004). 151

The aim of this study was to identify and classify phytoplasmas occurring in Rubus sp. plants
in Poland and to characterize them with molecular analysis of 16S *RNA and secY genes. Materials and methods

Rubus spp. plants with severe symptoms of stunting, short, and thin shoots were
observed on raspberry and blackberry plantations as well as in natural environments in
several localities in central Poland. Leaf samples were collected from 13 plants including
red raspberry (Canby, Polka, Veten cultivars); blackberry (Loch Tay and Darrow
cultivars), four wild blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) growing in forest (WB3, WB6, WB8,
WB10); as well as in hybrids tayberry and “Tummel’ (R. loganobaccus x R. idaeus), and
in two loganberry (R. /oganobaccus) plants. Some of the plants showed distortion and
premature reddening of the leaves, enlarged sepals, phyllody, flower proliferation, fruit
malformation, and dieback. Total DNA was extracted from veins of leaves using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). DNA was subjected to PCR with P1/P7 (Deng and Hiruki, 1991;
Schneider eral., 1995) followed by nested universal primers R16F2n/R16R2 (Gundersen
and Lee, 1996): primer pairs R16(I)F1/R1, R16(III)F2/R1, R16(V)FI/R1 (Lee et al.,
1994) specific to 16S rDNA ofaster yellows (16Srl), X disease (16SrIII), and elm yellows
(16SrV) phytoplasma groups, respectively were also employed. DNA from a sample of
healthy raspberry was included as negative control. RFLP and sequence analyses of 16S
rDNA fragment amplified with universal primers R16F2n/R16R2 were conducted to
identify the phytoplasmas. PCR products were digested using Hpall, Hhal, Rsal, and
Bfal restriction enzymes. AY1 (16Srl), CX (16SrIII), and RuS (16SrV) strains, kindly
provided by A. Bertaccini (DipSA, Plant Pathology, University of Bologna, Italy), were
employed as reference strains. The resulting RFLP patterns were also compared with
published profiles of representative phytoplasma strains (Lee et al., 1998; 2004). SecY gene was analysed to detect a possible finer differentiation among 10 strains of ‘Ca. P. rubi. Amplification of the entire translocase (secY) gene and portion of the ribosomal
protein L15 (rp/15) gene was conducted using two sets of 16SrV-group specific primer
pairs: FD9f2/FD9r followed by FD9f3/FD9r2 (Angelini et a/., 2001; Daire et al.,
2001). RFLP analysis was conducted after digestion of the nested PCR products with
restriction enzymes: Tagl, Msel, Alul, Hpall, Hbal, and Sspl. Phylogenetic analysis
was carried out on nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA and secY genes from 11 and 9
phytoplasmas respectively, and reference strains obtained from GenBank. The partial
nucleotide sequences of 165 rRNA and secY genes were compared using the BLAST
algorithm (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Multiple alignment was made using
ClustalW of the DNASTAR’s Lasergene software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI,
USA). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were carried out by the
neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in ClustalW of the genetic analysis software
MEGA, 4.02 (Tamura et a/., 2007). 152

PCR products with RIGF2n/R1G6R2 primers were obtained for all 13 tested samples,
but for two of them (loganberry and WB8) no specific products were amplified
when primers specific for elm yellows phytoplasma group were used. On the basis of
RELP analyses with Hpall, Hhal, Rsal, and Bfal restriction enzymes and comparative
analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene, it was shown that Rubus spp. plants were infected by phytoplasmas belonging to three different ribosomal groups. Most of the samples were infected by ‘Cz. P. rubi’ belonging to the elm yellows (EY)
phytoplasma group, 16SrV (Figure 1). RELP analysis of amplicons from cultivars Veten,
Polka, Loch Tay, Tammel, Tayberry, Darrow, Canby, and three wild blackberry plants
(WB3, WB6, WB10) yielded patterns indistinguishable from those of strains RuSR19,
RuS400, RuS971, and RuS classified to the EY group (Lee ef a/., 2004). It was reported
that this phytoplasma has also occurred in wild and cultivated raspberry and blackberry
in Germany, France, Italy, the UK, and Poland (Maurer and Seemiiller, 1994; Bertaccini
et al., 1995; Lee et al., 1995; Marcone et al., 1997; Davies, 2000; Vindimian er al., 2004,
Cicslitiska, 2011). The RIGF2n/RIGR2 products from two loganberry plants digested
with four endonucleases resulted similar to the reference strain of X-disease phytoplasma
group (16SrIII). X disease phytoplasma was previously identified in loganberry in the

UK (Davies, 2000) and in black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) in USA (Davis et al.,
2001). Digestion patterns of a 16S rDNA fragment from the wild blackberry (WB8)
growing in natural environment resulted identical to the one of the reference strain of
“Ca. P. asteris’ (16SrI-B). Although this phytoplasma infects Rubus spp. plants rarely
it was also identified in wild raspberry and blackberry growing in Austrian forests
(Borroto Fernandez et al., 2007), as well as in blackberry found in Pakistan (Fahmeed et
al., 2009), and in the UK (Reeder e¢ al., 2010). The analysis of nucleotide sequence of 16S rDNA fragment of 11 selected strains
confirmed the results of PCR-RFLP analysis. A phylogenetic tree derived by analysis
of 16S rRNA gene sequences delineated three distinct clusters among analyzed
phytoplasmas. It was shown that nine of them (from cultivars Veten, Polka, Loch Tay,
Tummel, Tayberry, Darrow, Canby, WB3, and WB6) showed a 99.7-99.9% sequence
similarity to each other and formed a monophyletic cluster with the reference strain

Diseases and insect vectors

Based on the phylogenetic analysis results the strain from loganberry plant shared 99.8%
sequence similarity with CYE reference strain from Canada assigned to X diseases
phytoplasma group (GenBank accession no. L33766). X disease phytoplasma was
previously identified in loganberry in the UK (Davies, 2000) and in black raspberry (Rubus
occidentalis) with witches’ broom symptoms in Oregon (Davis ef al, 2001). Multiple
alignments revealed that the 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence of WB8 strain from wild
blackberry shared 99.9% similarity with the sequences of OAY reference strain of ‘Ca. P.
asteris’ (GenBank accession no. M30790) belonging to aster yellows phytoplasma group. The partial sequences of the 16S rDNA region of the five strains (from cultivars Canby,
Polka, Veten, loganberry, and WB8) of phytoplasmas detected in Rubus spp. plants were
deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers: GU125723-27. Results of the PCR-RFLP analyses on the entire secY gene and fragment of rplIS
gene confirmed that ten Rubus spp. plants were infected by ‘Cz. P. rubi. Although
the secY gene is one of the most variable among the markers used for differentiation
of phytoplasma strains especially from the same 16S rRNA group (Daire ef a/., 2001;
Martini e¢ al., 2007; Lee et al., 2010), the restriction profiles of Polish ‘Ca. P. rubi’ strains
were indistinguishable from each other and from the RuS reference strain (Figure 3). SI)

Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the PCR/RELP results and indicated that these strains
grouped together with the RuS reference strain (Figure 4). It was previously reported
that secY gene wasa reliable marker to differentiate some of the “flavescence dorée” strains
from Italy, Serbia, and France (Martini et a/., 2002; Paltrinieri er a/., 2011). Although
Polish strains of ‘Cz. P. rubi’ originated from several localities in central Poland, they
seemed to form a genetically homogenous group. Four of the phytoplasmas found in Poland were detected in Rubus fruticosus growing in
forest. Although the phytoplasmas are transmitted mainly with infected plant material,
Rubus spp. plants growing in natural environments can become a reservoir of these
pathogens. After detecting aster yellows and “stolbur” phytoplasmas in wild raspberries
and blackberries, Boroto Fernandez et al. (2007) suggested that infected plants growing
ina natural environment may play an important role in their spreading. References

Abstract

‘A high number of plants showing symptoms attributed to phytoplasma infection was
observed in Rubus spp. in the field. In order to obtain a reference sequence from Rubus
plants a 1,852 bp fragment amplified from the 16S rRNA-23S rRNA region was cloned and
sequenced, and the phytoplasma was determined as belonging to group 16SrV. Nested PCR
assays using the universal primers allowed the detection of phytoplasmas in 35/133 (26.3%)
samples, corresponding to 28/39 plants (71.8%). Nested PCR using group V specific primers
showed that in 21/34 samples a phytoplasma belonging to the group 16SrV was present, and
this was farther confirmed by RFLP analyses. The presence of a phytoplasma belonging to
16SrIII was also confirmed in one Rubus cultivar. Explants of phytoplasma-positive plants
were established in vitro for sanitation by in vitro thermotherapy and meristem preparation. Key words: raspberry, rubus stunt, cloning and sequencing, PCR/RFLP, X disease. Introduction

Phytoplasmas belongs to the class Mollicutes and are obligate intracellular plant-
pathogenic bacteria, restricted to the phloem (Weisburg et a/., 1989). They infect many
economically important plants worldwide, including small fruit species like Rubus
ideaus (red raspberry) and Rubus fruticosus (blackberry) in the Rosaceae family (Lee et
al, 1995; Maurer and Seemiiller, 1995; Marcone et al., 1997; Davies, 2000; Vindimian
et al., 2004; Borroto-Fernandez et al., 2007; Valiunas et al., 2007; Cieslinska, 2011). Phytoplasma infections induce symptoms on host plants which are often non-specific
toa particular group of phytoplasma (Tolu e¢ a/., 2006). Typical phytoplasma symptoms
in infected plants include: stunting, shoot proliferation, small leaves, short internodes,
enlarged sepals, phyllody, flower proliferations and fruit malformations (Valiunas ef al,
2007; Bertaccini, 2007; Bertaccini and Duduk, 2009; Cieslinska, 2011). Phytoplasma
infected fruits are of small sizes and have poor taste (Heinrich et a/., 2001; Laimer,
2009) which interferes with quality traits desired by the consumer. So far, symptoms
referable to the above in Rubus spp. have been associated with phytoplasmas belonging
to the groups of elm yellows (165tV), X disease (16SrII1), aster yellows (16SrI) and
“stolbur” (16StXII) (Lee e¢ al, 1995; Bertaccini et al., 1995; Maurer and Seemiiller,
1995; Marcone et al., 1997; Davies, 2000; Jarausch et a/., 2001; Ermacora et al., 2003;

Sertkaya et al., 2004; Vindimian et al., 2004; Borroto Fernandez et al., 2007; Valiunas et
al., 2007; Oberhansli et a/., 2011; Cieslinska, 2011). It was proposed that Rubus stunt phytoplasma (16SrV) representa novel distinct candidate
taxon: ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma rubi’ within the 16SrV group due to its distinct biological
niche and genomic differentiation (Malembic-Maher et al., 2011). Phytoplasmas and are transmitted from plant to plant by grafting and other vegetative
propagation techniques and by phloem feeding insects, particularly leafhoppers, plant
hoppers, and psyllids (Bertaccini and Duduk, 2009). It is therefore of importance to
avoid spreading of phytoplasma diseases in field crops. Furthermore, for plant breeders
it is important to avoid infected plant material for grafting, and to have healthy parental
material for breeding work. To achieve this, an early detection of infected plants and an
efficient sanitation procedure are prerequisites (Oberhansli e¢ a/, 2011). Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) based methodologies are mainly used for phytoplasma detection
(Gundersen and Lee, 1996). Primers design on phytoplasma specific DNA-probes or 16S
rRNA gene sequences and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the same
gene are used for identification and classification of phytoplasma groups (Lee et al., 1998). A high number of field growing Rubus spp. plants showing symptoms attributed to
phytoplasma infection were observed in Italy and Germany. For this reason PCR, RFLP and
molecular cloning were employed to detect and identify phytoplasma infecting this plant
species. Iv vitro methods established for the elimination of virus and phytoplasma from fruit
trees were adapted to produce healthy Rubus spp. planting material (Laimer, 2009). Material and methods
Plant samples and DNA extraction

From a high number of field growing Rubus spp. plants showing symptoms referable
to phytoplasma infection a representative sample of 39 plants (32 Rubus idaeus and 7
Rubus fruticosus), originating from Italy and Germany, were used. Total genomic DNA
was extracted from 133 samples of leaf veins, bark scrapings, flowers, flower buds, fruits,
sepals, stipules, roots and petioles with DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany)
according to the supplier's instructions. Partial cloning and sequencing of a reference strain

For the cloning and sequencing of a reference strain, the universal primer pair P1/P7 was
used to amplify a 1,852 bp fragment covering the entire 16S rRNA gene, the intergenic
spacer region and the S’end of the 23S rRNA gene. Amplification was performed in 25
ul final reaction volume containing 2.5 ul of 10x Ex Taq buffer, 2 ul of dNTPs mixture
(2.5 mM each), 0.125 ul ZakaRa Ex Taq” HotStart, 1 ul of each primer (10 pmol),
and 2 ul of total genomic DNA. PCR was performed for 35 cycles under the following
conditions: 30s denaturation at 94°C (10s at 98°C for the first cycle), 30s annealing at
55°C and | min extension at 72°C. A final step of 10 min at 72°C ended the cycle. 160

Diseases and insect vectors

A subsequent nested PCR assay was performed using different primer pairs (P1/RubR,
PA2E/PA2R, and RubF/P7) (Table 1) to obtain a set of overlapping PCR products
covering the entire region. The PCR mix and cycles were as before, except for the
annealing temperature of 60°C for primers P1/RubR and RubF/P7. The PCR products
were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The P1/RubR, PA2F/PA2R, and RubF/P7 amplicons from Rubus ideaus were
purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). Products were ligated into
pGEM“-T Easy Vector System (Promega) and transformed to competent cells of E. coli
JM109 following the supplier's instructions. Transformants were selected on LB agar
containing ampicillin (100 ug ml"), 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-8-D-galactopyranoside
(80 mg ml") and isopropyl $-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mM). The transformed
bacterial colonies were isolated using the alkaline-lysis method, digested with Notl-HF
(New England BioLabs), visualized on agarose gels to confirm the presence of an inserted
fragment and sequenced. The obtained sequences were analyzed using the DNASTAR
Lasergene software and compared with phytoplasma sequences from GenBank using
BLASTh (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Table 1. List of primers used in this study. Primer Primer sequence 5’ to 3° Source

PCR analyses with general and group specific primers

Nested PCR was performed using different primer sets (Table 1) to allow general or
group specific phytoplasma detection. Nested PCR assays were carried out by using
the universal primers R16mE2/R16mR1 amplifying approximately 1,500 bp, followed
by the universal primers R1GE2nM/RI6R2 or by 16StV specific primers R16(V)F1/

161

Chapter 3

R16(V)RI amplifying 1,250 bp and 1,100 bp respectively. The first PCR was carried
out according to Gundersen and Lee (1996), except for an annealing temperature of
55°C. The amplicons were diluted in 1: 40 and used as a template in nested PCR. PCR
mix and cycle conditions were similar to those used in the first PCR round except for
an annealing temperature of 64°C and 56°C for RIGF2nM/RI6R2 and R16(V)F1/
R16(V)RI, respectively. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR products

PCR products from primer R16F2nM/RI6R2 were excised from the gel, eluted using
QlAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN) and subjected to digestion with the restriction
enzyme Msel (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions. Digested products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide and resulting patterns compared with profiles of the restriction
patterns of reference strains (Lee et a/., 1998), sequence was compared in the interactive
online phytoplasma classification tool iPhyClassifier (Zhao et a/., 2009). In vitro culture for sanitation

About 20 - 30 buds from actively growing plants were used for the shoot establishment. Every bud was treated like an individual clone. Following the surface disinfection procedute,
the plantlets were propagated on MS (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) based medium
supplemented with growth regulators and kept under at 24°C under 16/8 (light/dark) hrs
photoperiod. Separated cultures of each clones were produced for the pathogen detection. Results

Cloning and sequencing of nested PCR products allowed the assembly of a 1,852 bp
fragment extending from the 5’end of the 16S rRNA gene to the 5’end of the 23S
rRNA. Blastn analyses confirmed the identity of the phytoplasma, with 99% sequence
similarity, to Rubus stunt isolate (accession number: Y16395) and virtual RFLP analyses
allow to show identity with reference phytoplasmas in 16SrV group (Figure 1). Figure 1. Msel RFLP virtual patterns of the 16SrV group phytoplasmas. The
phytoplasma sequence cloned from the cultivar Tulameen 4 was used as
input sequence (arrow) for the iPhyClassifier online tool. @X174DNA-Haelll

plants, 28 (71.8%) were positive. In general, from the 133 samples collected from
different plant parts, 35 (26.3%) were positive of which 14 out of 56 (25%) were leaf
veins, 10 out of 49 (20.4%) bark scrapings, 4 out of 9 (44.4%) sepals, 4 out 7 flowers
(57.19%), and 1 out of 3 (33%) fruits. In addition, 1 out of 2 samples (50%) analysed
from the roots and petioles were positive while no products were amplified from flower
buds and stipules. Furthermore, nested PCR with primers R16(V)F1/R16(V)R1
specific for group 16SrV phytoplasmas gave positive results in 21 out of 34 (61.8%)
samples (Figure 2). The presence of phytoplasmas belonging to 16SrIII (X disease
phytoplasma) was confirmed in one Rubus cultivar (data not shown). In vitro culture for sanitation

Explants of positive plants were established as in vitro cultures and maintained in
the Wien collection of fruit pathogens (Table 2). Sanitation experiments by in vitro
thermotherapy and meristem preparation are currently underway. Discussion

Phytoplasmas are present in low titres and are often unevenly distributed between
different host plant tissues (Lee et al., 1995), which makes their detection rather difficult
(Nejat er a/., 2009). The most reliable diagnostic methods encompass the collection of samples from
different parts of an individual plant to be tested. This was quite relevant in the
current study as detection showed that not all samples collected from an infected plant
yielded positive results. Furthermore, utilization of sensitive techniques such as PCR
and nested PCR are important in phytoplasma identification, with the RFLP analysis
of PCR products providing additional evidence of differentiation into phytoplasma
ribosomal group (Bertaccini, 2007). In the present study, cloning and sequencing of
a partial sequence resulted affiliation of the detected phytoplasma to group 16SrV-E.
Nested PCR assay using the group 16StV specific primer pair on Rubus plants showed
that 61.8% of samples were associated with a phytoplasma belonging to this group. The

163

Chapter 3

presence of phytoplasmas belonging to 16SrIII (X disease) was confirmed in one Rubus
cultivar, in agreement with previous findings that showed the presence of group 16SrIII
and 16SrV in Rubus spp. (Davies, 2000; Borroto-Fernandez et al., 2007; Cieslinska,
2011; Malembic-Maher et a/., 2011). In conclusion, the presence of phytoplasmas infecting Rubus spp. is a serious threat
to the cultivation of this economically important fruit species. The presence of these
phytoplasmas is connected to their transmission with infected plant material during
vegetative propagation. This therefore calls for a rapid elimination strategy to be utilized
in the production of propagation and breeding plant material. Table 2. In vitro collection of Rubus species maintained in Wien collection of fruit pathogens. Species Cultivar or clone Mericlone

Abstract

Apple proliferation (AP) and pear decline (PD), two diseases associated with ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma mali’ and respectively ‘Ca. P. pyri; have been reported in Belgium. Sporadically
apple trees with clear symptoms of witches’ broom and pear trees with symptoms of pear
decline were reported in the past. Recently a limited survey was carried out and samples were
analysed using molecular tools. Root samples of apple trees with and without symptoms
were collected and analysed by real time PCR which confirmed the presence of AP in both
symptomatic and asymptomatic trees. PCR analysis of leaf samples of pear trees showing carly
discoloration revealed PD presence, As Cacopsylla spp. are able to transmit ‘Ca, P. mal’ from
infected to healthy trees within and between orchards, the dynamic of the psyllid population

 

was studied in apple orchards and hawthorn hedges from March to August. Several insect
species were identified: C. mali, C. melanoneura, C. picta, C. peregrina, and C. affinis. Molecular analysis of individuals indicated the natural infection of C. mali and C. peregrina
with AP, however preliminary transmission trials on an artificial substrate could not prove the
vector ability of C. mali. Key words: apple proliferation, pear decline, Cacopsylla, vector, control. Introduction

Phytoplasmas, polymorphic bacteria lacking a cell-wall, infect the phloem of many
plants (Lee et a/., 2000) and, probably due to the lack of important genes, have a parasitic
way of life in order to survive and multiply. With their size of about 500 nm in diameter
and their genome ranging from 530 to 1,350 kilobases they belong to the smallest
microbes among the class of Mollicutes (Marcone et al, 1999). In European top fruits
two phytoplasmas are known: ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’ (apple proliferation, AP,
in apple) and ‘Cz. P. pyri’ (pear decline, PD, in pear), both member of the 16SrX apple
proliferation group (Bertaccini, 2007). They are mentioned on the EPPO A1/A2 list
and are present in 25 (AP) and 23 (PD) European countries (EPPO, 2013). 167

Chapter 3

Although symptoms vary depending on variety, age, vigour of the tree, and climatic
conditions, specific symptoms of apple proliferation include witches’ broom, enlarged
stipules, shortened internodes, elongated peduncles and undersized fruit (Kunze,
1989; Lee ef al, 2000; Seemiiller ef al., 2002). Less specific symptoms are phyllody,
leaf yellowing and reddening, leaf curl, premature autumn discoloration and increased
sensitivity to powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha). The infection of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ is
not easy to be recognized, as symptoms of early leaf discoloration can also be caused by
rootstock/scion incompatibility, variety, or physiological disorder. Transmission of AP phytoplasmas is established by propagation of infected budwood
and/or rootstocks (Kartte and Seémuller, 1991), by root contact between trees (Ciccotti
et al., 2007) and by insects (Weintraub et a/., 2010). Both fruit tree phytoplasmas are
transmitted by psyllids belonging to the genus Cacopsylla (Hemiptera, Sternorrhyncha,
Psylloidea) in a propagative, persistent manner (Marzachi er a/., 2004). Within this genus
two species C. melanoneura (Foerster) (Frisinghelli et a/., 2000; Tedeschi and Alma,
2004; Pedrazzoli et al., 2007; Mattedi e¢ a/., 2008) and C. picta (Foerster) (Jarausch et
al., 2003; 2004; Carraro et al., 2008) were thus far found to be able to transmit ‘Ca. P.
mali. Both psyllid species were also found in orchards in the southern part of Belgium
(Fassotte et al., 2010). ‘Transmission of pear decline has been described for C. pyricola (Foerster) in England
(Davies et al.,1992) while in other parts of Europe C. pyri (L.) was identified as the
main vector (Garcia-Chapa et al., 2005). The pear sucker is the most common pest
in pear orchards in Belgium (Bangels e¢ al., 2008) and morfological determination of
specimens collected in orchards in the Flemisch part of Belgium indicated that C. pyri
was the dominant species in 4 provinces; only in one province (near the North Sea)
C. pyricola was in the majority (Vandijck, 1987). According to monitoring data of the
past decades collected by pcfruit vzw, the mean date for the start of activity is February
4th, soon followed by egg laying. At about the 1* of April, the first larval stages emerge
in the field. Larvae develop through 5 instars into a winged imago and over time
become less mobile and secrete more honeydew. This cycle is repeated several times
per year, resulting in 3 to 5 succeeding generations. The development stages of the
first two generations can be distinguished easily, while from third generation on, in
summer, they largely overlap. For the efficient control of pear suckers we developed
and tested optimal IPM strategies based on well thought-out treatments of insecticides
and alternative products (e.g. kaolin, potassium bicarbonate and mineral oils) (Belien
etal. 2013). In 1981, apple proliferation was reported for the first time in Belgium (Maroquin et
al., 1981). Until recently symptomatic trees had been observed sporadically and found
infected, but they were subsequently destroyed. In September 2009, two apple trees
close to each other were sampled by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain
(FASFC) ina nursery in the south-west of Belgium and tested positive by PCR (Olivier
et al., 2010). Infected trees, as well as adjacent trees, have been uprooted and burned

to prevent disease spread. Symptoms of pear decline had been observed in the past in
some orchards, but the presence of PD was never confirmed by molecular tools. To gain
information on the status of both diseases in Belgium a research project funded by the
FASFC was started. Besides this diagnostic survey the psyllid population in a few apple
orchards and hawthorn hedges was also investigated as well as the natural infectivity and
vector ability of the psyllids. Material and methods

Detection of ‘Ca. P. mali’ in roots of apple trees

In 11] apple orchards, 3 private and 8 commercial, distributed over 5 fruit growing area
in Belgium root samples were collected by digging up small pieces at a distance of 20
cm from the trunk of the tree and taken at a depth of 20-40 cm. In production farms
samples of symptomless trees were taken from every 15th tree, as well as from other trees
showing any suspicious symptom(s) of apple proliferation. Roots were cleaned with water and 200 mg of phloem tissue was collected by scalpel
scraping, then transferred into a plastic bag and stored on ice. Two ml cold extraction
buffer (137 mM NaCl; 8 mM Na,HPO,; 1.5 mM KH,PO,; 2.7 mM KCl; 80 mM
Na,S0,; 3 mM NaN, ; 0.05% Tween 20; pH 7.2) was added followed by homogenization
with a Homex (Bioreba, Reinach, Switzerland). The suspension was centrifugated
(13,000 x rpm, 20 min, 4°C) and the supernatans - also referred to as ‘crude extract’-
were stored at -20°C until further use (Aldaghi et a/., 2009). The crude extracts of
asymptomatic samples belonging to the same orchard were analysed in groups: each
group consisted of 50 ul of 10 samples in a total volume of 500 ul. This mix was diluted
10 or 100 times with sterile distilled water while extracts of symptomatic samples were
also diluted but analysed individually. Two different real time PCR programs were used to detect an infection with
AP. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 ul containing either 1x
qPCR MasterMix plus (Eurogentec), 400 nM of each primer (q-AP16S-R:
CCAGTCTTAGCAGTCGTTTCCA, q-AP16S-F: CGAACGGGTGAGTAAC
ACGTAA; Baric and Dalla-Via, 2004), 200 nM TaqMan MGB probe (FAM
CTGCCTCTTAGACGAGG NFQ; Aldaghi, 2007), 5 ul crude extract, water
or 1x SYBR Green qPCR Mix 2x (Eurogentec), 200 nM of each primer (P1:
AAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAGGATT, RI6Flr; CATCTCTCAGCATAC
TTGCGGGTC; Torres et al, 2005), 5 pl crude extract and water. Program of the
TaqMan MGB PCR was 2 min 50°C; 10 min 95°C and 45 cycles (15 sec 95°C, 1 min
60°C) (Aldaghi et al., 2009) and of the SYBR Green PCR 10 min 95°C; 45 cycles
(15 sec 95°C, 30 sec 60°C, 30 sec 72°C) followed by a melting curve at 15 sec 95°C,
1 min 60 °C, 15 sec 95°C (Torres at al., 2005). Both programs were performed on a
StepOne” Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) or a 7500 Real Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). 169

Identification and population dynamics of Cacopsylla spp. in apple and hawthorn
In 2009 the population dynamics of Cacopsylla spp. was studied in 4 apple orchards
(from March till October) and in 5 hawthorn hedges (from March till June) using the
beating tray method and yellow sticky traps on a 2-weekly basis. Psyllids sampled by
the first method were aspirated into a collection tube and transferred to the lab where
they were identified (species, sex, life stage) and counted. Determination of the species
was carried out according to Burckhardt e¢ a/., 2008; Hodkinson and White, 1979 and
Ossiannilson, 1992. The psyllids on the yellow sticky plates were counted in the field
using a magnifying glass (15x). Natural infection with ‘Ca. P. mali’ of psyllids in apple trees and hawthorn hedges
From June till September psyllids C, mali were collected in an apple orchard showing
symptoms resembling those associated with ‘Ca. P. mali. The surrounding hawthorn
hedge was also sampled in the same period for C. peregrina. Samples were taken on a
weekly basis and consisted of >100 individuals. After a night at 10°C total DNA of
10 insects was extracted using the Ql[Aamp DNA Mini Kit and examined by real time
PCR for AP presence (Baric and Dalla-Via, 2004; Aldaghi, 2007; Aldaghi et a/., 2009)
(see Detection of ‘Ca. P. mali’ in roots of apple trees). Transmission of ‘Ca. P. mali’ by Cacopsylla mali

In July, August and September adult psyllids of C. mali were collected in the same
orchard mentioned above and kept at 10°C for a night. Each insect was transferred
to an individual rearing unit - a microcentrifuge tube with 200 ul nutritional medium
(5% sucrose, 0.5% sorbitol, 9.4 mg/l NCTC 135) applied in the lid and sealed with
Parafilm M - and kept under controlled conditions (16°C, 14/10h L/D). At different
time intervals (1 till 120 hours after transfer) 10 insects were removed and examined
under stereo microscope for mortality and sex. Both media and psyllids were used for
DNA extraction (Zhang ef a/., 1998; Jarausch, 2010) singly and examined by real time
PCR for AP presence (Baric and Dalla-Via, 2004; Aldaghi, 2007; Aldaghi et a/., 2009)
(see Detection of ‘Ca. P. mali’ in roots of apple trees). Results

Table 1 shows the results of PCR analyses and indicates that in all sampled orchards,
located in different areas, the AP presence was detected, regardless cultivation method
(production or private) or presence of symptoms. A large number (70%) of the
individually tested symptomatic trees proved to be positive. The asymptomatic trees
were tested in groups of 10 at first and results revealed the presence of AP within several
groups (21/36). Additional analysis of individual samples taken at 5 locations indicated

Identification and population dynamics of Cacopsylla spp. in apple and hawthorn
Five different Cacopsylla species were identified: C. mali, C. melanoneura, C. picta, C.
peregrina and C. affinis. In apple trees (Figure 1) C. mali was the most abundant species:
before bloom the overwintering eggs (on shoots) hatch into young nymphs (March)
and migrate into the flower buds (April). After blossoming (early May) the first adults
appear and remain in the orchard until September-October when they start laying eggs
whereupon they die. Adult psyllids of the overwintering generation of C. meloneura
returned into the orchard during February-March in a very small number. By the time
C. melanoneura had left the apple trees (April) few adults of C. picta occurred and only
for a few weeks. In hawthorn hedges (Figure 1) the number of returning C. melanoneura
was much higher and adults were dominantly present in the months March and April. After egg laying adults of the next spring generation appeared during May and emigrated
back to their shelters by end of June. At the same time C. peregrina psyllids were noticed
(May) and their number increased gradually from June onwards. Specimen of C. affinis
were found sporadically in March (apple) and April (hawthorn). During sammer (July)
adults of C. mali may disperse from apple trees to adjacent hawthorn hedges. Natural infection with ‘Ca. P. mali’ of psyllids in apple trees and hawthorn hedges
Adults of C. mali and C. peregrina proved to be naturally infected with ‘Cz. P. mali’ as
indicated by the PCR-results (Table 2). Detection of phytoplasma in the insect resulted
positive mainly for samples collected during the month September for C. mali and July
for C. peregrina. Table 2. Detection of ‘Ca. P. mali’ in psyllids (collected in the field) by real time PCR. Species Date Host plant PCR | Species Date Host plant PCR

Transmission of ‘Ca. P, mali’ by C. mali

Molecular analysis revealed that although psyllids were infected with AP (caught in
September), no transmission of phytoplasmas to NCTC could be established regardless
the inoculation access period spent on the substrate (Table 3). 172

Conclusion

Molecular analysis of root samples in apple trees and of leaf samples of pear trees
collected during a limited survey in production orchards and in private gardens located
at different fruit growing areas confirms the presence of ‘Ca. P. mali’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri’
in Belgium. In apple nearly 70% of the tested trees with symptoms were found to be
infected with AP, whereas in asymptomatic trees the infection rate varied between 5
and 50%. In pear only symptomatic trees were tested, and 15% of them proved to be
infected with PD (Olivier et a/., 2012). As only suspicious orchards were sampled results
are biased and care must be taken not to extrapolate to other orchards or even nurseries. As a consequence of these results, an extensive and systematic survey was carried out
by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain during 2011-2012 in 87 apple
tree nurseries. Infected trees were destroyed and eradication measures were imposed
in the nurseries concerned. The NPPO of Belgium is currently focussing its official
inspections on the production of propagation material and fruit trees. A new research
project has also been launched and funded by this Agency focussing on the presence of
pear decline and its vector(s). In apple orchards 3 psyllid species were found: dominantly Cacopsylla mali, fewer C.
melanoneura and rarely C. picta. Early in the season (February-March) overwintering
adults of C. melanoneura (few) and C. picta (lesser) entered the orchard, but after a
short period left to their host plants. On the apple trees overwintering eggs of C. mali,
hatched before blossoming and during flowering nymphs, migrated into the flowers. In
May all immatures turned into adults and remained in the orchard until oviposition in
September-October when they died. On hawthorn hedges C. melanoneura was also present from March to July and C.
peregrina from May onwards, C. affinis occurred sporadically in April (also in apple
in March). During summer (July) adults of C. mali may disperse from apple trees to
adjacent hawthorn hedges. Molecular analysis of C. mali and C. peregrina revealed
a natural infection of both species with ’Cz. P. mali’ when collected in July or later. However transmission of AP by C. mali to an artificial substrate could not be established. Efficient control of psyllids in apple and pear orchards relies on a perfect tuning of
treatment schedules, taking into account efficacies of (at preferably) low-impact
insecticides and side-(repellent)-effects of alternative products (e.g. kaolin, potassium

 

173

Chapter 3

bicarbonate and mineral oils), the optimal positioning of these crop protection agents,
and the best possible presence of beneficial predators (Belien et a/., 2013). From a
phytoplasma management viewpoint the economic threshold of especially C. pyri
should be lowered if there are any indications of pear decline in the close environment. Indeed, a control treatment that eliminates low numbered, but phytoplasma infected
psyllids will provide an economic return, possibly not on short term by lowering
honeydew-linked damage, but certainly on long term by preventing new infections of
healthy pear trees. Acknowledgements

Abstract

Following the application of molecular technologies the phytoplasma phylogeny was resolved
and led to the new trivial name of phytoplasma and to the designation of a new taxon named
“Candidatus phytoplasma’ Because of the highly conserved nature of the 16S DNA, many
biologically or ecologically distinct phytoplasma strains, which warrant designation of a new
taxon may fail to meet the requirements necessary for their differentiations. Some additional
tools for phylogenetic analyses and finer strain differentiation such as rp, secY, uf, groEL genes,
and the 16S-23S rRNA spacer region sequences were used as supplementary tools or developed
to provide useful and reliable taxonomic information in combination with 16S rDNA. Key words: molecular differentiation, markers, @roEL gene, phytoplasma population, RELP
analyses. Introduction

The phytoplasma classification scheme established using 16S ribosomal groups is based
on 16S rDNA properties. This tool for the phytoplasma differentiation has become the
most comprehensive and widely accepted classification system allowing phytoplasma
strain differentiation into groups and subgroups (Lee et a/., 1998). However the highly
conserved double copy 16S rDNA that has been used for more than a decade as the
primary marker for classification of phytoplasmas is affected by the not uncommon
presence of 16S rDNA interoperon sequence heterogeneity (Table 1), and it is not able
to differentiate many closely related strains, ecologically or epidemiologically different
(Duduk and Bertaccini, 2011). During the last decade, the number of phytoplasma
strains reported worldwide has increased exponentially. Without adequate information
of newly reported phytoplasma strains, it becomes difficult to update the classification
scheme ina timely manner. As an alternative approach has been developed an automated
computer-simulated virtual gel RFLP analysis system, iPhyClassifier, made on the basis
of sequence data available from GenBank for classification of an unknown phytoplasma. This allowed to expand and update the classification, which now comprises more
than thirty 16Sr groups and 100 subgroups (Lee et a/., 2010). On the other hand, the
‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ species description refers to 16S rRNA gene sequence with

179

Chapter 4

a threshold <97.5% similarity to that of any previously described ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’
species (IRPCM, 2004). However, because of the highly conserved nature of the 16S
rDNA, many biologically or ecologically distinct phytoplasma strains, which may
warrant designation ofa new taxon may fail to meet this requirement. Additional unique
biological properties such as antibody specificity, host range and vector transmission
specificity, as well as other molecular criteria need to be included for speciation. An accurate molecular distinction is therefore necessary for phytoplasma strain
characterisation and epidemiological studies, so additional markers were developed and/
or employed. At least the subgroup designation is necessary, in some cases for quarantine
pathogens such as those associated with ‘flavescence dorée’ assignment is necessary,
although not supported yet by official taxonomy. Multilocus sequence determination,
using other genes such as ribosomal proteins, secY, secA, tuf, groEL, nitroreductase and
thodonase-like is now employed as supplementary tool providing useful and reliable
information in combination with 16S rDNA for phytoplasma strains differentiation
(Mitrovié e al., 2011; Franova et al., 2013). As for most microorganisms, identification of phytoplasmas in field collected materials
is carried out on populations rather than on individual clones. Examination of selected
grapevine plants (that showed mixed phytoplasma presence in nested PCR assays) by
deep amplicon sequencing reveals not only mixed phytoplasma infection of diverse
16Sr groups/‘Ca. P. species, but also a high number of single nucleotide polymorphism. This demonstrates that phytoplasmas in individual plants are composed of populations
and deep amplicon sequencing is an useful tool to study this aspect in epidemiological
perspectives (Nicolaisen e¢ a/., 2011). Table 1. Classification of phytoplasmas based on RFLP analyses and/or sequencing of 16S rDNA. 16Sr group and Strain (acronym) Candidatus sp. Genbank

Abstract

In the frame of the EU FP7 project QBOL the traditional phytoplasma classification based
upon molecular phylogeny of the 165 rRNA was employed to generate a barcode system
that was implemented by adding two more genes suf and secd. Sequences from a wide range
of phytoplasmas representing the most relevant ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma species’ were
generated and deposited in a dedicated database (Q-Bank). Phylogenetic analysis of all the
genes used for barcoding has revealed full congruence and concordance with the one obtained
by conventional 165 rDNA, indicating that the system can be used fora cost effective and fast
phytoplasma identification. Key words: phytoplasma, detection, PCR, sequencing, 16SrDNA, tu/ gene, secd gene. Introduction

Phytoplasmas infect a high number of plant species. Based on the 16S ribosomal gene
sequence, over 30 ribosomal groups have been established within the ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma’ taxon, some of which are of quarantine status. Currently, phytoplasma
molecular identification and taxonomy are mostly based on 16S ribosomal DNA gene
comparison, however some other genes, such as translaton elongation factor Tuf, protein
translocase subunit secY, ribosomal protein operon rp, 16-23S intergenic sequence and
protein translocase subunit Sec A (Botti and Bertaccini, 2003; Hodgetts et al., 2008; Lee
etal.,2006; 2012; Marconeetal., 2000) are also in use for discrimination of phytoplasmas
belonging to the same 16Sr DNA group. Based on the at least 97.5% sequence identity
within 16S ribosomal sequence rule, over 30 “Candidatus Phytoplasma’ taxons were
designed (IRPCM, 2004; Bertaccini and Duduk, 2009). The basic phytoplasma identification methods is based on RFLP analysis of a 1.2
kbp region of the 16S rDNA, however, this method is not easy to set up and it only
considers a part of the available phytoplasma sequence information. As part of QBOL
project (Bonants ef a/., 2010), a universal DNA barcoding based tool for phytoplasma
identification was developed, and the system was validated for relevant quarantine
phytoplasmas. The phytoplasma secd and suf genes were employed as additional genes
in combination with 16SrDNA for phytoplasma strains differentiation (Makarova et
al, 2012; 2013; Hodgetts et al., 2014). 185

Materials and methods

Sets of primers amplifying a fragment of the /ufgene, a fragment of the secd gene and
a fragment of the 16S rDNA gene, respectively, were designed and their potential as
DNA barcodes was verified using both experimentally infected samples in periwinkle
and naturally infected samples from original host species (Makarova et al., 2012;
2013; Hodgetts et al, 2014). The amplicons produced were sequenced, aligned and
submitted to Q-Bank, sequences for the most relevant quarantine phytoplasmas were
also submitted to Genbank. Results and discussion

While the full 16S ribosomal gene is commonly used for phytoplasma taxonomy, its
use as a barcode is limited by the relatively long size and associated difficulties with
sequencing. Nevertheless, it was possible to identify a variable region of approximately
600 bp in the 3’ of the 16Sr gene, that resulted to be useful for barcoding. This region
was amplified from all phytoplasma strains tested, and construction of a phylogenetic
tree indicated its capacity to distinguish phytoplasmas at 16Sr group level. A conserved region within the ¢w gene, present in all phytoplasmas, was also studied
as barcode by using a cocktails of primers (Makarova et al, 2012; 2013), and a 420-
444 bp long barcode was amplified from all phytoplasma strains tested. Tuf barcode
sequence alignments and NJ tree construction showed that the tuf-based tree was
highly congruent with 16S rDNA derived trees and therefore useful as well as barcode. The tuf and 16S ribosomal barcodes could separate main ribosomal groups and most of
their subgroups. The phylogenetic tree, which was constructed based on these sequences,
followed branching patterns of that constructed with full 16S sequences, suggesting
that the tuf barcode enables fine discrimination of phytoplasmas on both group and
subgroup levels. Phytoplasma tuf barcodes were deposited in the NCBI GenBank
and to the newly developed Q-bank (http://www.q-bank.eu/Phytoplasmas), a freely
available online identification tool for plant pests and pathogens under quarantine
status in the EU. Successful amplification and sequencing of more than 150 phytoplasma strains in
total, and ability to separate various phytoplasma strains to ‘Candidatus species’ level,
16S ribosomal group and subgroup level, suggest that these barcodes are efficient
phytoplasma identification tools. Since it has been recently demonstrated that also the secd gene provides a phylogenetic
analysis which is congruent with the standard 16S rRNA gene (Hodgetts er a/., 2014),
itis possible to use the secd gene as a diagnostic barcode tool. The three barcode regions
were up to now amplified from 37 strains and deposited under Genbank (Table 1). The obtained sequences can thus be used by plant health services and researchers
for online phytoplasma identification. As DNA sequencing is now routine in most
countries and the sequencing costs have substantially dropped: this allows DNA

Abstract

The problem of European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) disease detection in apricot and
peach trees grown in South Moravia, Czech Republic was studied during cight years. ESFY
symptoms were evaluated visually. Biological indexing was carried out on the peach indicator
GF-305 and different primer pairs were used for molecular detection by PCR. Thirty eight
apricot trees were evaluated, Forty seven percent of trees infected with ESFY died during the
time of evaluation, False positive reactions in nested PCR assays were obtained in samples
from fifteen trees, but also the biological indexing was not reliable because of many negative
results from symptomatic trees. Also ESFY detection in peach trees by biological indexing
was found to be not very suitable, the presence of pathogen was proved only in 42.2% of
symptomatic trees, The reliability of ESFY detection by nested PCR in peach trees was
higher than in apricot trees, ESFY was detected in 82.2% of symptomatic peach trees and
less false positive results were found. Three false positive results of PCR were proved in two

 

ESFY free peach trees during the period of five years. The presence of specific and typical
symptoms, interveinal yellowing, partial rolling and fragility of leaves is still the most reliable
criterion for detection of ESFY in apricot and peach trees grown in the Czech Republic and
farther improvement of PCR procedures is necessary for its early and reliable detection in
symptomatic apricot and peach trees. Key words: phyroplasma, ESFY, stone fruits, detection, symptoms. Introduction

The presence of European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) phytoplasma, ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma prunorum, (Seemiiller and Schneider, 2004) in apricot trees was reported
in the Czech Republic since 1990 (Navratil e¢ a/., 1998). The phytoplasma infected
apricot trees died within two years after symptom appearance (Navratil e¢ a/., 2001). In 2002 ESFY phytoplasma was detected by PCR in symptomless apricot trees in the
South Moravia: these plants were not dying and the results of nested PCR assays were
completely different from the biological test (Polik et a/., 2007). False positive reactions
were proved both in direct and nested PCR in preliminary tests of ESFY detection. Only the typical symptoms of ESFY, yellowing and leaf rolling of leaves, little leaves
together with small number of leaves on shoots were used as reliable diagnostic criterion
for ESFY disease (Polak et a/., 2008). Peach trees were also found to be ESFY infected
in the same region as apricot trees. 190

Ahrens and Seemiiller (1992), Heinrich e¢ al. (2001), and Skrzeczkowski et al. (2001)
have reported the possibility of false positive results in the diagnostics of phytoplasmas
of fruit trees by PCR assays. Other authors published evidence that sets of primers used
for detection of phytoplasmas in fruit trees can give inaccurate results (Barba er a/., 1998;
Brzin et al, 2003; Jarausch ef al., 1999; Lorenz et al., 1995a); therefore experiments
were established in apricot and peach orchards where typical symptoms of ESFY were
observed. Results of eight years study of ESFY detection in apricot orchard and six years
study in peach orchard are presented. Detection of ESFY in apricot frees

A collection of samples from 38, twelve year old trees of four apricot cultivars
(Bergeron, Goldrich, Velkopavlovicka, and Boccuccia Liscia) that grew in orchard
where ESFY symptoms appeared, was evaluated during eight years. The presence of
ESFY was evaluated by inspection of symptoms, PCR detection, and indexing on the
peach indicator GF-305. Visual evaluation of symptoms was performed at least three
times during vegetation period from June to October in the years 2004-2011. All trees
were tested by direct and nested PCR assays once per year. Shoots were sampled at
the beginning of November and the detection of ESFY by PCR tests was carried out
immediately after collection. Specific primers fAT/r PRUS were used in direct PCR
assays (Lorenz et al, 1995). Direct PCR was carried out with the primers RIGF1/
RIGRO (Lee ef al, 1995), and nested PCR was performed with two pairs of primers,
RIGF2/RI6R2 and fUS/rU31 (Lee et al., 1995; Lorenz et al., 1995a). A modified
protocol from Ahrens and Seemiiller (1992) was used for DNA extraction. Shoots sampled in November were stored at 4°C for biological indexing. Buds taken
from sampled shoots of tested tree were grafted in March on the wooden indicator GF-
305 in three replicates for each tested tree. Symptoms on indicator plants were evaluated
for the first time one months after chip-budding, and then after five months at least
once per month. Collection was carried out in the part of the orchard with high presence of ESFY
symptoms. Sixteen trees (42.1%) showed no ESFY symptoms during the whole eight
year period of evaluation. Four trees died of Monilia sp. attack (10.5%). Eighteen trees
(47.4%) showed ESFY symptoms and died during the eight years of evaluation. Six trees
with ESFY symptoms in the first year of evaluation died by the end of the first vegetative
period. Another twelve trees died during the next seven years. Apricot trees showing
ESFY symptoms died in the year when ESFY symptoms appeared, or in the next one
or two years. There were not significant differences among the four apricot cultivars as
concerns ESFY infection. The biological indexing on GF-305 was not reliable and is inapplicable because of many
negative results of tested trees with ESFY symptoms. No positive results were obtained
in five years and just only one or two positive results (GF-305 indicator plants died)

A lot of false positive reactions were recorded in nested PCR assays in the sixteen trees
with no ESFY symptoms during eight years of evaluation; negative results of nested
PCR in healthy, asymptomatic trees were obtained during the eight years of evaluation
only in one tree (6.25%). False positive reactions were obtained in 15 asymptomatic
trees (93.75%). Results obtained during the eight years in the commercial orchard of apricot trees with
ESFY presence, proved the devastating effect of this phytoplasma disease; 47% of apricot
trees showing ESFY symptoms died during the eight years of evaluation. One tree was
showing ESFY symptoms for three years, and no symptoms in the other three years. The
only reliable detection of ESFY resulted to be the visual evaluation of symptoms, i.e. the
presence of specific symptoms in leaves and shoots of apricot trees. Detection of ESFY in peach trees

A collection of 16 peach trees eight years old growing in orchard where ESFY disease
was present was evaluated during 2007-2012. Four selected peach trees were healthy
and 12 peach trees showed typical ESFY symptoms, interveinal yellowing and partial
rolling of leaves, smaller leaves and sparse foliage with different intensity in the first
year of the evaluation. The presence of ESFY was detected by indexing on the peach
indicator GF-305, by PCR methods, and by evaluation of symptoms. The latter was
performed at least three times (in June, August, October) during vegetation period in
the years 2007-2012. Two-years old shoots were collected in November (2007-2011),
and partly was immediately used for molecular tests, the second part was stored till
March for biological indexing,

Three independent diagnostic methods were compared: PCR analyses, biological
indexing on peach GF-305, and evaluation of ESFY symptoms. Molecular detection
of ESFY was carried out by PCR. DNA was extracted using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit
(Qiagen) from phloem scrapings taken from two-year old branches. From every sample,
three different PCR reactions were run: primers ECA1/ECA2 under conditions
according to Jarausch et al. (1998); primers fAT/rPRUS according to Smart et al. (1996), and nested PCR assay with primers RI6RO/RIGF1 followed by R16R2/RI6F2
according to Lee et al. (1995). Results of six years evaluation (2007-2012) on peach trees are presented in Table 2. ‘Two peach trees remained without ESFY symptoms from the beginning of year 2007
till May 2012, and biological and PCR tests were negative. Two trees without ESFY
symptoms included at the beginning of 2009 showed ESFY symptoms, the first in 2010,
the second one in 2012, but ESFY was detected by PCR already in 2011. Two times
ESFY symptoms were not present in diseased trees. The reliability of visual inspection
and evaluation of ESFY symptoms in peach trees was 97%. Five peach trees with ESFY
symptoms died: three of them in the second half of vegetation period in 2008, one
during the winter 2008/2009, and the last one died during the winter 2010/2011. 193

The presence of ESFY was proved by PCR tests in trees with symptoms. Results of all
the three used PCR procedures were the same, but the bands of nested PCR (Figure 1)
were stronger. The reliability of ESFY detection by PCR assay was 82.2%. Three false
positive PCR reactions were recorded together with 15 negative and 37 positive results. The incidence of false positive results was 5.8%. Symptoms on the indicator plants
appeared for the first time one month after the chip budding and plants were evaluated
in the period of April to July. Wilting and dying of indicator plants have appeared within
one and two months after the chip budding. The presence of ESFY was proved in nine
symptomatic trees from thirteen symptomatic trees tested by indexing on the indicator
plants peach GF-305. The reliability of ESFY detection by testing on indicator plants
was 69.2%. The evaluation of symptoms and molecular detection based on PCR assays
are a reliable criteria for ESFY detection in peach trees. 194

Obtained results of both, molecular detection and biological indexing of ESFY in
peach trees are more reliable in comparison with reliability of ESFY detection in
apricot trees. Peach trees showing ESFY symptoms can survive more than six years,
but apricot trees not more than two, exceptionally 3 years. Detection of ESFY in
apricot and peach trees by biological indexing is not suitable because of low reliability. The only advantage of biological testing is the absence of false positives. The visual
inspection and evaluation of ESFY symptoms in apricot and peach trees is up to this
time the most reliable diagnostic method. Acknowledgements

Abstract

Working group 3 covered inside the COST action the aspect of phytoplasma control in crop
systems. The network was mainly focused on economically important phytoplasma diseases
of grapevine and fruit trees, Several aspects were covered such as identification and breeding of
crop plant varieties that are resistant (or less susceptible) to the phytoplasmas; examination of
the effects of biotic and abiotic environmental factors on disease and symptom developments
improvement of vector control with special attention to low-impact insecticides, and
treatment schedules as well as development of innovative, environmentally sustainable vector
control strategies and recommendations for best practices in disease control verification. The
interaction of endophytes with host plant and phytoplasma that could be used to control
phytoplasma diseases and verification whether mild phytoplasma strains can effectively
protect plants from infection by virulent (or severe) phytoplasma strains were also studied. Key words: phytoplasmas, environment, plant resistance, endophytes, disease management. Introduction

As phytoplasmas are phloem-limited plant pathogens which are spread by phloem-
feeding insects in nature their control is difficult. It can be carried out theoretically
either by controlling the vector or by eliminating the pathogen from the infected
plants. The first requires the knowledge of the vector and its biology, and usually is
achieved by repeated insecticide treatments. As European policy aims to reduce the
impact of insecticides, one major objective was to develop and validate innovative
environmentally friendly control strategies of phytoplasma vectors. Elimination of
phytoplasmas from infected plants is almost impossible, and may only be achieved
by repeated antibiotic (tetracycline) treatments which are usually not allowed in
practical application. Therefore, another objective was the identification and use of
natural resistance of plants to phytoplasmas. One of the best studied examples of plant
resistance to phytoplasmas is apple. Natural resistance to ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
mali’ has been found in Malus sieboldii, and is currently used to develop phytoplasma-
resistant apple rootstocks. Studies aiming to elucidate the mechanism of this resistance
indicate that general plant defense mechanisms are involved, and that some responses
are similar to those found in susceptible Malus which show recovery, a more or less
stable remission of symptoms. 199

Chapter 5

As natural genetic resistance is rare — and engineered resistance neither developed nor
accepted ~a further objective was the identification of alternative control strategies based
on biocontrol agents or plant resistance inducers. In this regard, endophytes have gained
major interest, especially for the control of phytoplasma infections in perennial woody
crops like grapevine and fruit trees. It could be shown that the microbial population
in healthy, phytoplasma-infected and recovered grapevines or apple is different. The
interaction of endophytes with phytoplasmas might be due to the induction of a
systemic resistance. The histological, biochemical and molecular studies carried out to
elucidate the phenomenon of recovery might be of great help also to analyse the possible
biocontrol action of microorganisms. Phytoplasmas live and multiply in two different hosts: plants and insects. They are
highly dependent on host metabolites and their interaction with the environment
is complex. A successful, sustainable and environmentally friendly phytoplasma
control will have to be also complex: the plant defense to phytoplasmas needs to
be strengthened, and the spread of the phytoplasma by its insect vector needs to be
reduced. A smart combination of different approaches will reduce the need for a high
efficiency of a single method. Together with insect vectors, propagation material plays a main role in phytoplasma
disease dissemination in woody host plants, especially for long-distance transmission
and introduction of diseases in new geographic areas. Use of phytoplasma-free planting
material is therefore a prerequisite for any control strategy. Management of phytoplasma diseases through genetic resistance

Despite the numerous diseases associated with phytoplasmas on cultivated and wild
plants worldwide, few resistant species or varieties have been obtained. Some studies
performed on woody plants, like fruit or coconut trees are the exception. Indeed,
exploitation of genetic resistance for phytoplasma disease management is most advanced
in apple. Identification of natural genetic resistance is often hampered by the lack of an efficient
resistance screening system. A defined phytoplasma inoculum should be efficiently
inoculated to the plant genotype to be tested, and the infected plant should be evaluated
with a defined system. In this regard, important differences between fruit trees and
grapevine have to be considered: whereas phytoplasmas can easily be maintained in
fruit trees and can efficiently be transmitted by graft-inoculation, this is not the case
in grapevine. Here, inoculation by the insect vector is most efficient. This makes the
resistance screening of a large number of genotypes more difficult, and a distinction
between a resistance to the phytoplasma or to the insect vector cannot easily be made. The evaluation of the resistance of the inoculated plant has become much more precise
since the measurement of phytoplasma concentration by quantitative real-time PCR
has been applied. In this regard it is important to note that resistance to phytoplasmas

200

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

in fruit trees and grapevine is defined as absence of symptoms and growth alteration,
together with low titer of the pathogen, whereas tolerance is absence or mild symptoms
but high titer of the pathogen. Further research focus on the development of model systems to study the resistance
and its molecular basis under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Here, plant tissue
culture of fruit trees has been used. A practical application of genetic phytoplasma resistance in fruit trees and grapevine is
also largely dependent on the physiology of the plant, in particular the phloem renewal
in scion (=cultivar). The complete replacement of the previous year’s phloem by the
new year’s phloem takes place every year in late winter in pome and stone fruits. This
leads to a natural elimination of the phytoplasmas from aerial parts of the trees, which is
complete in apple and pear, but less complete in stone fruits. Phloem renewal in the root
system is a constant process permitting the survival of the phytoplasmas in the roots of
the infected trees. The resistance strategy for the management of fruit tree phytoplasma
diseases is therefore based on the development of resistant rootstocks, which prevent
a recolonisation of the aerial part of the trees by the phytoplasma in springtime. This
strategy has the great advantage that the pomological traits of the cultivar remain
unchanged. This resistance strategy can probably not be applied in grapevine as the
phloem in the aerial parts of grapevine is not completely replaced every year. In this case,
resistant cultivars are needed. However, not only a resistance to the phytoplasma must
be considered but also a resistance to the insect vector. Search for natural genetic resistance to ‘Ca. P. mali’ within the taxa Malus has been
extensively carried out in the eigthies and nineties of the last century. Satisfactory
resistance was shown by trees on M. sieboldii and M. sieboldii hybrids. A classical breeding
program has been started in 2001 to integrate the agronomic values of established apple
rootstocks into these AP-resistant genotypes. However, this breeding program faced
several obstacles which drastically reduced the output of selected genotypes: a high level
of apomixis of M. sieboldii and its hybrids made it difficult to obtain a sufficient number
of recombinant genotypes for further selection. The different degrees of polyploidy of
the resistance genitors made it impossible to develop molecular markers for assisted
selection, and finally, a high sensitivity of some genotypes to latent apple viruses was
observed during the resistance evaluation of the breeding progeny. To date, several
selected genotypes are available from the breeding program which are resistant to ‘Ca. P.
mali; but tolerant to latent apple viruses and which have promising pomological values
These genotypes can easily be micropropagated and will now be assessed in further
agronomic trials (Jarausch ef a/., 2013). As pear decline (PD) is a devastating disease not only in Europe but also in North
America, screening for natural resistance to ‘Ca. P. pyri’ has been first done in America by
studying different Pyrws taxa and clonal rootstocks under natural infection conditions. Ina more recent trial carried out in Germany progenies of 39 open pollinated genotypes
belonging to 26 Pyrus taxa were graft-inoculated and observed for at least 18 years. Also

this study revealed considerable differences in PD resistance between and within the
progenies. Although identification of genetic resistance to ‘Ca. P. pyri’ is not as clear
as for ‘Ca. P. mali; its potential for a durable management of PD disease is similar. As
for AP the use of resistant rootstocks would be sufficient to reduce the impact of PD,
because the winter elimination of the phytoplasmas in the aerial parts of Pyrus is similar
to the conditions observed in Malus (Jarausch et al., 2013). Identification of natural resistance to ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ is less advanced. It infects
several cultivated stone fruit species and wild Prunus whose response to the infection
ranges from susceptible (apricot, peach, Japanese plum) to tolerant (European plum)
and highly resistant (cherry). Since ‘Ca. P. prunorum’is able to overwinter in the above-
ground parts of Prunus, resistance of both rootstock and scion cultivars is required. However, interesting levels of resistance have been observed in several hybrids and y-ray
mutants of Reine Claude cultivars (Jarausch et a/., 2013). Intraspecific (V vinifera cultivars) and interspecific (hybrids and rootstocks) variability
in plant susceptibility to the grapevine yellows (GY) diseases is well known from
field experience and observations. Differences between cultivars in terms of symptom
frequency and intensity, but also in the ability to recover were recorded for “bois noir”
(BN) and “flavescence dorée” (FD). Rootstocks appeared as a promising source of
resistance because only a few rootstock genotypes were found to be naturally infected,
and some inoculated rootstocks showed few or even no symptoms of the disease. A
study was recently initiated in order to evaluate the susceptibility to the FD disease of
major V vinifera cultivars, Vitis hybrids used as rootstocks, but also wild Vitis species
originating from North American and Asian continents under controlled conditions by
insect inoculation. Highly (e.g. cultivars Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Grenache)
and poorly susceptible (e.g. cultivars Merlot, Syrah) genotypes could be identified based
on recording the symptoms, the percentage of infected plants and by measuring the
mean phytoplasma titer in the whole plants by quantitative real-time PCR (Jarausch et
al.,2013). Several studies carried out in the last few years aimed to find out genes and proteins up
and down regulated during GY infection, and thus potentially involved in grapevine
resistance to phytoplasmas. Qualitative and quantitative changes in the global gene
expression profiles of BN-infected and healthy plants of cultivar Chardonnay were
performed using microarray technology. Expression levels of a few hundred genes were
altered in infected plants, and some genes related to defence pathways were induced
or repressed specifically in only one cultivar. Another study investigated the proteome
responses of moderately susceptible and susceptible varieties to FD phytoplasma, and
identified some proteins which were exclusively expressed in one cultivar. Thus, all
genes and proteins differentially expressed in varieties showing different susceptibility
are potentially associated with the differential susceptibility to the phytoplasma, and
could be candidate genetic traits for GY resistance (Jarausch et a/., 2013). 202

Management of phytoplasma diseases through induced resistance

Stimulation of plant defenses has become of great interest for researchers because it
offers the possibility to contain phytoplasma diseases within an integrated approach,
together with the applied control measures based on clean propagating materials, vector
control and weed management. This can be particularly true where phytoplasma diseases
limit the growing of particular species or cultivars in areas with high disease pressure. One of the few possibilities to contain the occurring of disease symptoms, is the use of
resistance inducers. These molecules, called also elicitors, can be of abiotic or biotic
nature and challenge the plant, leading to a reaction, often linked to the production of
antimicrobial compounds and/or the elicitation of plant defense mechanisms. Recovery has been reported in several plant species belonging to the Rosaceae family
(apple and stone fruits) and in grapevine; it has been defined as the spontaneous
remission of disease symptoms in plants that previously showed them. The
phytoplasmas disappear from the aerial parts, but may persist in the roots. Recovered
plants are re-infected in nature in a lesser extent than the never infected ones, indicating
that a resistance could be involved in the phenomenon. Studies carried out during the
last years have enabled new insights into the physiological basis of this phenomenon. Cytochemical analyses revealed that it is accompanied by biochemical changes in the
phloem. Recovered plants are able to accumulate, in the sieve elements, H,O,, a stable
reactive oxygen species whose antimicrobial as well as signaling roles are well known. The variation of sieve-element oxidative status leads to modifications of phloem protein
(P-protein) conformation, and in phloem occlusion expression patterns. An anomalous
accumulation of callose and protein, associated with the upregulation of callose synthase-
and P-protein-coding genes, has been observed in the sieve elements of recovered apple
trees, supporting the hypothesis that recovered plants are able to develop resistance
mechanisms depending on Ca** signal activity. Recently, the activation of jasmonate
(JA)-related defense mechanism, via JA gene upregulation, has also been demonstrated
in apple trees recovered from apple proliferation disease (Musetti et a/., 2013). Abiotic and biotic resistance inducers were studied for their potential to induce this
recovery reaction. Abiotic resistance inducers are usually chemical compounds able to
start a reaction of the plant. The most common elicitors used to control phytoplasma
diseases are: benzothiadiazole (BTH), phosetyl-aluminium, prohexadione calcium,
indole-3-butyrric acid (IBA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), chitosan, salicylic acid (SA),
mixture of glutathione and oligosaccharines (GOs). Most studies were carried out on
experimental hosts infected with a phytoplasma. SA was applied in crops of tomatoes
infected with potato purple top phytoplasma. Trials on woody crops infected by
phytoplasmas can be more difficult because it is not easy to find a high number of
plants that after application allow getting significant differences in recovery induction. However, the treatment with resistance inducers can be successful in decreasing
the number of infected plants, reducing the severity of symptoms, and delaying the

203

Chapter 5

appearance of disease. So far, resistance inducers have been successfully applied in
grapevine (Romanazzi, 2013). The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in phytoplasma infection has been
investigated in several pathogenicsystems. In “stolbur’” infection oftomato, agglutinations
and degeneration of phytoplasma cells, coupled to reduced symptom expression, was
seen in plants treated with AM fungi. Inoculation with Glomus intraradices increased
tolerance to pear decline in infected pear trees. However, the evidence that G. mosseae
BEG 12 inoculation does not decrease periwinkle tolerance to mild and severe “Ca. P. asteris’ strains has indicated that the effects of AM fungi on phytoplasma infection
are complex and probably dependent on a combination of host plant, AM fungus and
phytoplasma strain (Romanazzi, 2013). Endophytic bacteria promote plant growth and protect them against pathogen infections. Endophytes-plant and endophytes-pathogens interactions are poorly explored. In
particular, the ability of endophytes to control pathogens that are not managed directly
is still new. Recently, Pseudomonas putida S1Pf1Rif was tested, alone or in combination
with the mycorrhyzal fungus Glomus mosseae BEG12, against chrysanthemum yellows
(CY) phytoplasma infection of chrysanthemum. A basic point for the success of sustainable management of plant diseases based on
biocontrol agents is the study of endophytic bacterial community associated with plants. Recently endophytic bacteria associated with healthy and phytoplasma infected plants
have been described, suggesting some putative biocontrol agents. Nevertheless, to be
suitable for biocontrol a bacterium should not only produce secondary metabolites, but
it should compete with indigenous microorganisms, and maintain the interactions with
the host. To verify the ability of endophytic bacteria in phytoplasma control, model
systems need to be developed (Bianco et al., 2013). Fungal endophytes establish mutualistic relationships with plants, also inducing
physiological modifications in their hosts, making them more resistant against biotic
or environmental stresses, Strains have been identified from grapevines and apple plants
grown in areas where a recovery phenomenon was recurrent. Strains of Epicoccum
nigrum and Aureobasidium pullulans were chosen for further research activities because
they were extensively reported as biocontrol agents or resistance inducers. Using the
model plant C. roseus infected with ‘Ca. P. mali, it was observed that reduction in
symptom severity and lower phytoplasma titre in host tissues occurred when the plants
were previously inoculated with an endophytic strain of E. nigrum (Bianco et al., 2013). Management of fruit tree phytoplasma diseases through vector control

As there is no applicable means to cure a phytoplasma infected fruit tree; insecticide
treatments were the first measures to control the spread of fruit tree phytoplasma
diseases whenever a vector species was identified. Although it is impossible to eliminate
all vectors from the environment, well managed vector control strategies significantly

204

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

reduce the chance of an epidemic outbreak of phytoplasma diseases. However,
important differences exist between the control of univoltine and polyvoltine psyllid
vectors. Highly efficient univoltine vectors, e.g. Cacopsylla picta, the vector of apple
proliferation disease, might be present in the orchards in very low abundance and
appropriate and efficient insecticides might miss or might not be homologated in all
countries. Therefore, control of univoltine vectors is not well studied as it is the case
for Cacopsylla pruni, the vector of European stone fruit yellows. On the contrary,
polyvoltine pear psyllids, vectors of pear decline, are pests on their own and, therefore,
control strategies and efficacies of different insecticides are well studied. Pear decline is associated with ‘Ca. P. pyri? which is transmitted by pear suckers
(psyllids/psylla). In UK Cacopsylla pyricola is known as vector species of pear decline,
while in other parts of Europe Cacopsylla pyri has been described as the main vector. Efficient control of pear suckers relies on a perfect tuning of treatment schedules, taking
into account efficacies of (at preferably) low impact insecticides and side (repellent)
effects of alternative products (e.g. kaolin, potassium bicarbonate and mineral oils),
the optimal positioning of these crop protection agents, and the best possible presence
of beneficial predators. From a phytoplasma management viewpoint the economic
threshold of C. pyri should be lowered if there are indications of pear decline presence
in the close environment. Indeed, a control treatment that eliminates low numbered,
but phytoplasma infected psyllids will provide an economic return by preventing new
infections of healthy pear trees (Belien e¢ a/., 2013). Two univoltine psyllids, C. picta and Cacopsylla melanoneura, are acknowledged
vectors of ‘Ca. P. mali. As both species hibernate on conifers in larger distances from
the orchards, their control is possible only when the insects are present on cultivated
plants. The control strategy aims to prevent the reproduction of both species on apple. A particular problem arose for the control of overwintered adults of C. picta in years
when oviposition coincided with the period of blossom, when insecticides cannot be
applied. In this case the strategy can be focused on the control of the development of
the new generation. The results of the transmission trials showed that both generations
of C. picta can transmit the phytoplasma. Consequently, in areas where the disease is
present, both the remigrants and the new generation must be controlled. Therefore the
precise prediction of the migration phase and the larval development is indispensable
for an efficient control of the vectors of ‘Ca. P. mali. Only very few attempts have been undertaken to control Cacopsylla pruni, the vector
of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ by classical means of spraying. C. pruni is an univoltine species
strictly oligophaguous on Prunus species which hibernates on conifers. Also for this
psyllid, possible control is restricted to the period when it reproduces on its host plant. However, the disease might be endemic (present on wild plants) and the populations of
C. pruni might be abundant. Basic research on several phytoplasma - vector - plant systems are currently carried out
with the aim to develop innovative control strategies such as species specific traps for

 

205

Chapter 5

monitoring, and mass trapping of different vector species of fruit tree phytoplasmas. The
strategy is based on the chemically mediated interactions of the different phytoplasmas
affecting pome and stone fruits, their host plants, and the vectors C. picta, C.
melanoneura and C. pruni. By analyzing the complex chemically mediated interactions
between ‘Ca. P. mali; its two vectors C. picta and C. melanoneura, and their host plants
(reproduction host and overwintering host), it could be shown that this phytoplasma
lures the highly adapted vector C. picta to infected apple plants by changing its odor. The
phytoplasma induces apple trees to produce more &-caryophyllene which preferentially
attracts new generation adults of C. picta (emigrants) just before their emigration to
the overwintering host. By feeding on infected plants, the probability of an acquisition
of the phytoplasma increases. In contrast, the hawthorn psyllid C. melanoneura did
not react to this sesquiterpene. After overwintering, the psyllids return to apple plants
(emigrants), but prefer to lay their eggs on uninfected plants. By doing so they transmit
the phytoplasma to previously healthy hosts. Which infochemical(s) may regulate the
observed oviposition behavior still remains unknown. Based on these findings traps
with attractive components like &-caryophyllene were constructed, e.g. useful for
monitoring programs. By this the adequate date for spraying can be determined and,
thus, the amount of chemical insecticides can be reduced. Because in the AP system
the infochemical produced by infected plants is attractive to both sexes of psyllids, it
could also be possible to develop mass trapping systems for a sustainable control of
these insects in the future. Also for C. melanoneura and C. pruni potentially behavior
modifying compounds could be identified, but to date they are not species specific. Interestingly, potential repellent chemicals for emigrants of C. pruni were identified. This offers the possibility to combine attractive compounds to be used in traps as lures
for monitoring and mass trapping purposes and with repellent compounds to be used in
complex push-and-pull strategies (Eben and Gross, 2013). Management of grapevine phytoplasma diseases through vector control

‘Two grapevine yellows due to phytoplasma infection are mainly affecting the European
vineyards: “flavescence dorée” (FD) is a quarantine disease in Europe as it is epidemically
transmitted by the grapevine leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus, an insect of North American
origin now widely distributed in the vineyards of southern Europe. “Bois noir” disease
(BN) is endemic in the Euro-Mediterranean area and is mainly transmitted by Hyalesthes
obsoletus, a planthopper residing in weeds such as bindweeds (Convolvulus arvensis) and
stinging nettles (Urtica dioica) which also act as plant reservoirs for the BN phytoplasma. Due to the biology of S. titanus, that is strictly associated with grape and has only
one generation per year, the control of “flavescence dorée” spread mainly relies on
the control of this leafhopper and S. titanus population level and disease spread are
clearly correlated. The control of the vector is mandatory and detailed guidelines
have been enacted for the different vine growing regions. An area wide and prompt

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

monitoring of the vector is the pre-requisite to design a rational control strategy. Monitoring has several different purposes: to detect the presence of the vector in
a given area, to establish the developmental stage of the population in order to well
time the insecticide application, to detect the population level to eventually reduce the
number of insecticide applications, to check the application of compulsory insecticide
treatments, and to evaluate the efficacy of the insecticide applications. Among the
different control techniques, only insecticides and agronomic methods are generally
applied. Biological control with predators and parasitoids, though naturally acting in
the field, is not effective enough. Insecticides are generally applied twice a year in the
areas characterized by a high incidence/prevalence of the disease. In the areas where
the disease is under control only one application is suggested. In the very last years, the
presence of an important number of S. titanus adults late in the season (late August and
September) has been recorded. Often these leafhoppers harbor FD phytoplasmas and,
therefore, can be infectious. Due to the risk of these incoming infected leafhoppers, a
third insecticide treatment to the vineyard borders surrounded by wild vegetations or by
abandoned vineyards is suggested in August. Actually, untreated areas represent refuges
for the vector that can re-colonize the cultivated vineyards. As a long term perspective,
symbiotic control and vibrational mating disruption strategies are under investigation. Obviously, these latter perspectives are far from the field application and, therefore, the
optimization of chemical and agronomical control techniques is imperative to limit the
spread of FD (Bosco and Mori, 2013). “Bois noir” (BN) is associated with ‘Ca. P. solani’ a phytoplasma which is endemic in
the natural vegetation and transmitted from and to herbaceous plants by the cixiid
planthopper H. obsoletus. Grapevine is infected through the occasional feeding of
this vector. Since H. obsoletus does not acquire BN phytoplasmas from grapevine, it
is considered a dead end host for the phytoplasma. Consequently, BN incidence does
not influence the further disease spread and there is no need to remove infected vines
from vineyards. Infection pressure is rather determined by the presence and infection of
natural host plants, associated vector and their density and distribution patterns within
and around the vineyards. This implies that attempts to reduce infection pressure need
to overstep the vineyard borders and must focus on the natural phytoplasma-vector-
host-systems. H. obsoletus has one generation per year in Europe. Eggs are deposited in the soil where
the five larval instars feed on the roots of their host plant, of which field bindweed
and stinging nettle are the most important species. BN is acquired by the nymphs
from the roots of infected hosts. The life cycle is completed with the emergence of
adult planthoppers, which live on the aerial parts of a wide range of host plants and
occasionally feed on grapevine, too. The presence of H. obsoletus is not restricted to
vineyards, but depends on the occurrence and distribution of its natural plant hosts
within and outside the vineyards. Infection pressure is therefore not only determined by
the specific conditions of particular vineyards, but it depends also on the general biotic

 

207

Chapter 5

and abiotic conditions on a larger scale. Light and permeable soils, sparse vegetation
and high isolation resulting in a favorable microclimate are key factors for the presence
of H. obsoletus. Consequently, strategies to control this planthopper focus on the
nymphs on the roots of their host plants. Since bindweed and nettle harbor different
strains of BN, typing of BN isolates from infected vines allows the identification of the
locally predominant reservoir plants. While a well managed greencover can suppress
bindweed in the vineyard interrows, it remains a problematic weed in the undergrowth
of the grapevines. Mechanical or chemical weeding of the area is advisable to avoid a
high infection pressure emerging close to the grapevine plants. Chemical weeding of
nettles aims at depriving the root feeding H. obsoletus nymphs of their food source. Herbicide treatments proved to be equally effective when applied either in autumn or
in early spring. Alternative approaches beside host plant control have been evaluated with more
or less success. Although they might be not practicable in general, they may provide
solutions to specific problems. Insecticides that are translocated to the roots after foliar
application on host plants, proved to kill the nymphs and to reduce the numbers of
emerging adult H. obsoletus with an efficiency that was comparable or slightly lower
than the early chemical weeding. The use of insecticides could be considered as an
“emergency treatment” shortly before the start of the emergence of adult vectors when
herbicide treatments are not efficient anymore (Maixner ef a/., 2013). References

Abstract

Hyalesthes obsoletus is the vector of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’ (“stolbur”) from
herbaceous hosts to grapevine. The associated disease “bois noir” (BN) is regularly found in
Austrian vine growing regions. Previous findings showed only small numbers of H. obsoletus
in these areas, particularly on bindweed. In contrast, recent survey revealed high population
densities of H. obsoletus on stinging nettle, both frequently infected with “stolbur”, Sequence
analysis of the “stolbur” marker genes secY, stamp, tufand ump] revealed the presence of asingle
dominating genotype, named CPsM4_Actl. This genotype was the only one found in stinging
nettle and was predominant in H. obsoletus and in grapevine in different areas. Interestingly,
although the sequences of the markers secY, stamp and vmp1 of CPsM4_At] were mostly
related to previously described nettle genotypes, CPsM4_At] showed a tuf-type b pattern
in Hpall restriction analysis, which was previously attributed only to bindweed associated
“scolbur” strains. Altogether, five nettle and nine bindweed associated genotypes could be
described. Transmission experiments with H. obsoletus and with Anaceratagallia ribauti
resulted in the transmission of five strains to Catharanthus roseus. During this investigation
also ‘Ca. P. convolvuli was identified in nettle and bindweed. Key words: “bois noir’, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani stamp, vmpl, secY, bindweed
yellows, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma convolvuli. Introduction

“Bois noir” (BN) is a grapevine yellows disease associated with “stolbur” phytoplasma
(‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’) that is also found on a number of herbaceous plants
and on diseased nightshade plants such as tomato and potato (Quaglino et a/., 2013). Grapevine is believed to be a dead end host for ‘Ca. P. solani’, since its vector, Hyalesthes
obsoletus cannot survive on grapevine alone and feeds only erratically on that plant
(Constable, 2010; Maixner, 2011). The most important sources of “stolbur” phytoplasma for grapevine infection seem to
be bindweed and nettle. In Germany, it has been shown that “stolbur” phytoplasmas
have a nettle and a bindweed associated host race corresponding to the Tuf elongation

factor restriction patterns tuf-type a and tuf-type b, respectively, potentially with
distinct severity of symptoms (Langer and Maixner 2004; Maixner 2011; Johannesen
et al., 2012). BN is widespread in several vine growing regions in Austria and previous
investigations between 2003 and 2008 revealed an absence or low population densities
of H. obsoletus in most viticultural areas of Austria. The phytoplasma was frequently
ascertained in bindweed and grapevines, whereas infections of nettles were very
unusual. Previous analysis of tuf-types showed sole presence of tuf-type b (Riedle-
Bauer et al., 2006; 2008; Tiefenbrunner et a/., 2008). In addition to tuf, the gene secY,
encoding for a major membrane unit of the secretory pathway, and the membrane
protein encoding genes vmp1 and stamp have been used to characterize the genetic
diversity of ‘Cz. P. solani’ in multilocus sequencing approaches (Cimerman et al.,
2009; Fabre et al., 2011). Apart from H. obsoletus, also the Cixiidae Reptalus panzeri can transmit BN to
grapevine seedlings (Cvrkovi¢ et al., 2014) as shown for in south eastern European
populations. Moreover, transmission experiments with several Cicadellidae (Hemiptera,
Auchenorrhyncha) species have shown that the leafhopper Anaceratagallia ribauti can
transmit ‘Caz. P. solani’ to Vicia faba (Riedle-Bauer et al., 2008), but so far transmission
to grapevine has not been proven (M. Riedle-Bauer, unpublished). The aim of the
present study was to collect updated data on the epidemiology of BN in Austria, its
vector occurrence and to characterize “stolbur” strains occurring in Austria by the
molecular marker genes secY, stamp, tuf, and vmp1. Materials and methods

The investigations were carried out in more than 30 vineyards and their surroundings
all over Austria in 2011 till 2013. H. obsoletus and A. ribauti were collected by
vacuum sampling directly from Urtica dioica and Convolvulus arvensis using a
modified garden blower-vac (Stihl, Dieburg, Germany). Samples were also taken
from diseased grapevines and from the weeds on which the insects had been
collected. DNA extraction and PCR/RFLP analyses were carried out as published
earlier (Langer and Maixner, 2004; Riedle-Bauer et al., 2008). Phytoplasma DNA
was amplified directly as previously described with the primer pairs stamp fw-0 and
ry-0 (stamp; Fabre ef al, 2011), FTUFAY and rTUFAY (tuf; Schneider ef al, 1997),
POSecF1 and POSecR1, TYPHIOF and TYPHIOR (secY and vmp1; Fialova et
al., 2009), and for 16S with CTAATACATGCAAGTCGAACG (R16mF2m) and
TGACGGGCGGTGTGTACAAACC (RIGR2m) for 40 cyles, 30 sec 94°C, 45 sec
at 58°C and 90 sec at 72°C with 10 min final extension (modified from Lee at al.,
1998). The PCR products were single strand sequenced with stamp fw-0, TYPH10R,
1TUFAY and R16R2m, respectively. Field collected H. obsoletus and A. ribauti were
subjected to transmission trials with Catharanthus roseus (cultivar Sorbas Reinweif,
Austrosaat, Vienna, Austria) seedlings using 10 to 50 insects per experiment. Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

Results and discussion

H. obsoletus presence was ascertained at 23 out of 30 sampling sites. At the majority out
of these sites, the planthopper was found solely on stinging nettle (U. dioica), only on
one site (Klosterneuburg) on bindweed (C. arvensis). In nettles population densities
were high, often numbers of collected individuals exceeded 10 per square meter of nettle
vegetation, reaching mass occurrences in U. dioica stands with > 1,000 caught individuals,
eg. in Styria. H. obsoletus were frequently infected with the “stolbur” phytoplasma and
it was ascertained in 25% of the analyzed insect specimens, in 11% of the analyzed
nettles, and in less than 3% of the analyzed bindweeds. Interestingly, in three nettle and
in several bindweed samples 16S rDNA sequences corresponding ’Ca. P. convolvuli’ a
recently described taxon associated with bindweed yellows (Martini et a/., 2012) was also
detected. From these samples also tuf sequences were obtained in samples Ud12_270
and Cal2_686, which showed highest (89%) similarity to ‘Ca. P. solani’ sequences. In contrast to earlier works (Maixner, 2011), the previously described association (Langer
and Maixner, 2004) between tuf-type and herbaceous host plant in the epidemic cycle
was not confirmed. Positive H. obsoletus individuals trapped from stinging nettles were
infected with tuf-type b “stolbur” phytoplasmas as ascertained with restriction analysis
with Hpall. Only 5% of all “stolbur” positive H. obsoletus individuals and nota single H.
obsoletus analyzed in 2011 and 2012 showed a tuf-type a profile (n, number of “stolbur”
positive samples = 99). The tuf-type b was also ascertained in grapevines (n = 47), in
stinging nettles (n = 11) and in bindweed (n = 2). Tuf-type a genotypes could not be
confirmed in any of these plant samples. Sequence analysis shows, however, that only the minority of these tuf sequences are
“pure” tuf-type b as compared with the reference strains, but the majority (100% of
the stinging nettle, 66% of the grapevine, 91% of H. obsoletus, but none of the positive
bindweeds) has a G instead of an A on position 727 after the start codon. This base
is shared with tuf-type a strains and was named tuf-type b2. For a better analysis of
epidemiological cycles secY, stamp and vmp1 sequences were characterized and 14
“stolbur” subtypes were identified in Austria (Table 1). Despite this diversity, allowing a clear presence of these different genotypes, tuf
type b2 was almost exclusively linked with a single secY, stamp and vmp1 genotype,
making this combination by far the most common genotype named CPsM4_At] in
H. obsoletus (91%), stinging nettle (100%) and grapevine (64%). Also, as exemplified
in three different vine growing regions in Austria (Figure 1), this genotype is also the
most common in the different regions, despite variation of the accompanying types. Moreover, the secY, stamp and vmp1 genes linked to tuf-type b2 are more related to
previously described nettle associated genotypes (Johannesen ef al, 2012), than to
the bindweed types, which suggests that sequence analysis of several marker genes
still allows a discrimination between bindweed and nettle types, but that tuf-type b
restriction analysis with Hpall is not sufficient for all strains of “stolbur” molecular
characterization. 211

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

Based on that, five of the 14 genotypes found in this study in Austrian vine growing
regions belong to the nettle type (tuf-type a and tuf-type b2) and nine to the bindweed
type (tuf-type b). Two of the nettle types including the major genotype CPsM4_Atl,
and three of the bindweed types could be also transmitted to C. roseus. Hereby, H.
obsoletus was transmitting 4 different “stolbur” types including the major genotype,
while A. ribauti only transmitted two types. Based on the finding that H obsoletus is prevalent in nettle and the abundant occurrence
of the same genotype CPsM4_At] in stinging nettle, grapevine and H. obsoletus, it seems
likely that the major Austrian “stolbur” genotype is transmitted in an epidemiological
cycle including H. obsoletus and nettles. This also indicates a significant change in
the epidemiology of BN in Austria within a few years. Whereas till around 2008 H.
obsoletus and infections of nettle were rare (Riedle-Bauer et a/., 2006; Tiefenbrunner er
al., 2007; Riedle-Bauer et al., 2008), now high population densities of H. obsoletus and
frequent infections of nettles are detected. A third of all BN infections of grapevine were
associated with bindweed type, and it is not clear, where this type is originated from,
or if it derives from previous infection cycles. Although the bindweed type “stolbur”
was found in H. obsoletus and A. ribauti transmissions to C. roseus, this type was rarely
detected, so further research is required to evaluate if other insects than H. obsoletus
might play a role in BN infections also in Austria, especially by the bindweed type. BN is a disease characterized by sudden outbreaks and different epidemiological cycles
(Maixner, 2011). The reasons for such changes are not clear so far, but unexpected
increases of H. obsoletus populations on nettles have also previously been observed in
Germany and in South Moravia (Maixner ef al., 2011, Safdtova et al. 2011). Shifts of the
occurrence of “stolbur” types with an increase in bindweed type “stolbur” phytoplasmas
have also been documented in south Tyrol (Baric and Dalla Via, 2007). It seems that
this grapevine yellows is a dynamic disease, and it is possible that future outbreaks in
Austria in grapevine may include also those tuf-types a found so far only rarely in H.
obsoletus alone. Acknowledgements

Abstract

“Bois noir” disease (BN) is one of the most important grapevine yellows in Europe and is
induced by ‘Candidatus Phycoplasma solani, belonging to the “stolbur” group (16SrXIL-A). The disease is widespread in different vine growing regions in northeast of Spain such us La
Rioja, Alava, Navarra, Catalonia and Aragon. Several surveys have been done and the BN
incidence in affected plots of these regions varied with the geographic area and ranged from
3% to 75%. The main vector of “stolbur” phytoplasma in grapevine, the ciixid Hyalesthes
obsoletus was identified in all areas, but the population was low in most of the sampled plots. Key words: “Bois noir”, ‘Candidatus phytoplasma solani, Hyalesthes obsoletus, Urtica dioica. Introduction

“Bois noir” (BN) is one of the most important grapevine yellows in Europe and it is
induced by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’ (Quaglino et a/., 2013). It is vectored
by Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret from vineyard weeds to grapevine, although other
insects as Reptalus panzeri and R. quinquecostatus have also been reported as potential
vectors (Palermo et a/., 2004, Trivellone e al., 2005). Molecular characterization of
strains in plants and insect vectors is an important tool to find out details about disease
epidemiology such as the vectors and the host plants involved in the BN dissemination. In Spain, this disease was first observed in 1994 (Laviiia et al. 1995), but in recent
years its incidence seems to have increased in different grapevine regions (Sabaté et al.,
2007). According to the results obtained in previous studies, the strain tuf-type b was
the prevalent in the regions studied in Spain (Sabaté et a/., 2014). This
was identified in all the H. obsoletus specimens and in most of the grapevine samples
with the exception of the plants from “La Rioja Alta” and some plants from Navarre. The strain tuf-type b is associated with Convolvulus arvensis while the tuf-type a, is
associated with Urtica dioica. With the aim to determine the cause of the BN incidence
increase, a new study was undertaken in several regions in the northeast of Spain. ‘olbur” strain

Materials and methods

Samples of grapevine plants were taken in affected plots of different regions in “La
Rioja’, Navarre, Aragon and Catalonia. H. obsoletus was captured in these regions on

Chapter 5

C. arvensis and U. dioica. The insects were captured weekly with a D-Vac aspirator,
classified and stored in Eppendorf tubes at -20°C until analysis. Samples of grapevine
and H. obsoletus were analyzed by PCR technique. The molecular characterization of “stolbur” strains was achieved using PCR-RFLP
analyses with primers for éufgene encoding the elongation factor tu and primers stol-
1H 10, for the vmp1 gene encoding a membrane protein (Langer e¢ al., 2004, Cimerman
et al, 2009). Results and discussion

Inthe surveys conducted in Spain, tuf-type a and tuf-type b were identified in grapevine
plants, however in the vector H. obsoletus only tuf-type b was identified (Batlle et al.,
2009). In 2013, H. obsoletus has been captured for the first time in U. dioica in Navarre
and “La Rioja’, with a higher population that appeared later than those captured on
C. arvensis. (Table 1). The maximum population density in U. dioica was obtained
in Navarre in August 6th, when as much as 30 individuals were captured in one
aspiration. In C. arvensis only a maximum of 4 individuals were captured by aspiration
in the same region in July 9th (Figure 1). In “La Rioja” the maximum population on
U. dioica was obtained in August 14 th. The individuals captured on U. dioica are
probably responsible for the spread of the strain tuf-type a in grapevine plants of “La
Rioja” and Navarre. In Catalonia the strain tuf-type b continues to be the only one
detected. 2% 2

Abstract

During the last fifteen years European stone fruit yellows has become a major concern in
Austrian fruit production. The disease is transmitted by the plum psyllid Cacopsylla pruni, a
univoltine species overwintering on conifers and immigrating to Prunus spp. in early spring,
In the present study dispersal of remigrant C. pruni in apricot orchards was tracked by aid
of mark, release and recapture studies. Insects were collected in the field on Prunus spinosa,
marked by fluorescent dyes and released in two model orchards. Movement of the marked
insects and presence of naturally occurring insects were monitored by yellow sticky traps. In
orchards without insecticide treatment, insects easily covered distances from tree row to tree
row, or even farther, within 24 hours after release. After 8 days they were present in large parts
of the model orchards. The mark, release and recapture experiments also allowed following
the effects of a systemically acting insecticide that significantly reduced spatial and temporal
spread of the marked insects. Key words: ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni, insect movement, population size, luminescent
powder pigment, insecticide. Introduction

European Stone Fruit Yellows (ESFY) associated with the presence of ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma prunorum’ is currently present in all European and Mediterranean regions
where apricots are cultivated (COST action FA0807, 2014). In apricots the disease
is characterized by small-sized, conically rolled, chlorotic leaves, premature fruit fall,
small tasteless fruits, decreased vitality of infected trees and eventually death of single
branches or entire trees (Morvan, 1977; Marcone et al, 2010). ESFY is transmitted by the plum psyllid Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli) (Carraro et al.,
1998) that is univoltine, overwinters on conifers and immigrates to Prunus spp. in early

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

spring. On their Prams hosts the insects lay eggs and develop through five larval stages
into adults which migrate to conifers in summer (Ossiannilsson, 1992; Thébaud er al.,
2009). Studies suggest that overwintered C. pruni returning to orchards in spring are
the most efficient disease vectors. Secondary spread within a vegetation period seems to
be less common (Carraro et al., 2004, Thébaud er a/., 2009, Poggi Pollini et a/., 2010). Wild Prunus species are frequently tolerant hosts of the phytoplasma and suitable hosts
for C. pruni. So these plant species could play a significant role as source of infectious
vectors (Carraro et al, 2002). In addition ESFY is transmitted via propagation
material (Marcone et a/., 2010). Grafting experiments with ESFY-infected scions led
to significant infection rates in the progeny (Riedle-Bauer et a/., 2013). Laxness or gaps
in maintenance and testing of mother trees can therefore result in infection of new
orchards. The disease has become a major concern in Austrian fruit production during the last
fifteen years. Investigations in 2011 and 2012 revealed high infection rates and an
epidemic disease spread. The phytoplasma was ascertained in 9.8 to 63.3% of the analyzed
apricot trees, in 20 to 40% of the plum trees and occasionally in blackthorns. Infection
rates of the vectors were also considerable. Up to 11.5% of the overwintering generation
insects and 3.44% of the springtime generation insects carried the phytoplasma (Maier
et al, 2013). As a consequence the development of well adapted management strategies
is an urgent need. Proposed management approaches include the use of healthy propagation material, the
removal of rootstock suckers, uprooting of infected trees and application of insecticides
against both the overwintering and the springtime generations (Marcone ef a/., 2010). Clearing strategies, however, are likely to be insufficient or even inefficient in areas
where the disease is present epidemically on wild Prunus hosts (Thébaud et al., 2009). Actual effects of insecticides on disease spread are not yet clear. ESFY-transmission
experiments in greenhouse revealed a minimum inoculation period of 1-2 days
(Carraro e¢ al, 2001). In theory a fast acting, enduring insecticide should therefore
kill the vectors before inoculation of the trees, and in the end reduce new infections. Insecticide applications in an experimental orchard, however, showed inconclusive
effects on disease spread (Poggi Pollini er a/., 2007). Insecticide tests under controlled
conditions proved significant effects of Abamectin on C. pruni eggs and larval stages
(Jarausch et al, 2010). For the development of appropriate management strategies tracking vector presence
and behaviour within an orchard seems very helpful. Mark, release and recapture
experiments allow visualization of insect spread. Moreover they permit estimations
of natural vector population sizes determining the rate between captured marked and
unmarked insects. Our studies started with monitoring dissemination and population
sizes of remigrant C. pruni in insecticide-free orchards. In a second step preliminary
experiments focusing on the effects of a systemically acting insecticide were also
carried out. 219

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

Materials and methods
C. pruni remigrating to orchards in spring are regarded as the most efficient disease
vectors, thus all experiments concentrated on this developmental stage. Collection and marking of insects

Overwintered C. pruni adults were collected on P spinosa by beating tray method. Marking was performed as previously described (Nakata et a/., 2008; Maier et al., 2013). Pink (Karmin Tagesleuchtpigment, Artmaxx, Berlin, Germany) orange, green, white (all
UV elements, Nordhausen, Germany) and light blue (Guardi, Prussian blue UV active,
Boesner, Vienna, Austria) luminescent powder pigments were utilized. Stability of the
dyes in the field was investigated by transferring 10 dead, stained specimens per dye to
a yellow sticky trap exposed to outdoor conditions. Visibility of the stain in daylight
and UV light was examined weekly. Effects of the pigments on insect survival were
examined by a laboratory experiment with 10 individuals at a time. Statistical analysis
(Kruskal-Wallis H Test) was performed by aid of SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA)
(Maier et al, 2013). Field experiments 2012

The field experiments were carried out after flowering in an apricot orchard (1) located in
Krems, lower Austria. Before and during the testing period no insecticides were applied. Trees had standard size, within row tree spacing ranged from 4 to 5 m, while between row
distance was 6 m. Numbers and arrangement of the trees included in the experiments are
illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Experiment 1 started on 19th and experiment 2
on 26th of April: 600 C. pruni per experiment were coated with luminescent pigment
and freed on one single tree in the apricot orchard. For each release a different dye was
used. Movement of stained insects and presence of naturally occurring insects within the
orchard were monitored by yellow sticky traps (2 traps per tree including the release tree)
from 19th of April (release of the first stained insects) until 3rd of May (8 days after the
second insect release). The positions of the sticky traps are illustrated in Figures 1 and
2. During the experiment sticky traps were controlled at night using a black light torch
(UV elements, Nordhausen, Germany). After the end of the experiment all traps were
transferred to the laboratory and inspected under a binocular microscope and a standard
UV transilluminator (Vilber Lourmat, Marne-la-Vallée, France) (Maier et al, 2013). Field experiments 2013

Procedures were identical to 2012 except that the experiments were carried out in two
apricot orchards and insecticide applications were included in the study. Orchard 1 was
the same as in 2012. Orchard 2 was located in Klosterneuburg (lower Austria), planted
with spindle shaped trees; within row spacing was approximately 2 m, distance between
rows 4m and the test plot comprised 9 rows with 17 trees per row. Insect releases started
on 18th of April in orchard 1, on 23rd of April in orchard 2. At this particular time the

Chapter 5

orchards were insecticide-free. Thiacloprid (Calypso, Bayer Crop Science, Monheim,
Germany) was applied according to the manufacturer’s instructions on 25th of April
in orchard 1 and on 29th of April in orchard 2. In order to estimate the effect of the
insecticide on incoming remigrants, trees were allowed to air dry for 4 hours before
new differently stained insects were freed. Insect survival and spread before and after
insecticide application were monitored for two weeks (from the first release till one
week after the second release). Results

Stability of dyes and effects on insect survival

After exposure of marked insects to outdoor conditions for five weeks all dyes were
clearly visible in black or UV light. Kruskal-Wallis H Test revealed no statistically
significant differences between survival of unstained and stained insects and between
survival of insects coated with the different pigments. Field experiments 2012

The results of the two release experiments are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. In the first
trial 20 specimens (3.3%) were recaptured within 15 days (19 within the orchard, 1
in the adjacent 2 domestica hedgerow), in the second trial 18 (3%) were trapped in
the orchard within 8 days. In both experiments insect spread occurred rapidly. In
the first trial marked insects were observed on trees adjacent to the release point and
also in the next row of trees within one day after release. In the second trial marked
specimens were ascertained on adjacent trees and on trees two rows farther within 24
hours. 53 unstained naturally occurring plum suckers were also captured during the test
period. Relation between marked and unmarked insects on the traps allowed the rough
estimation that approximately 1,700 individuals were naturally present in this orchard. Field experiments 2013

Orchard 1. Fourteen marked and 40 unmarked individuals were captured within the test
week on insecticide-free trees leading to a estimated natural population size of around
1,700 individuals. Some insects reached the farthest traps (distance approximately 24 m)
already within 24 h after release and insect movement was observed during the entire test
week. After insecticide treatment no more insects originating from the first release were
trapped and the treatment decreased the number of recaptured insects from the second
release to 11. Thiacloprid reduced the spatial dispersal as the vast majority of stained
individuals was recaptured close to the release point. Movement of marked insects on
insecticide treated trees was predominantly observed within the first 24 h after release. Moreover the treatment had a significant effect on naturally occurring insects. Within
the second observation week only 18 individuals were ascertained on the traps. 222

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

Orchard 2. On untreated trees 37 marked and 128 unmarked C. pruni were captured
within one week. Already after 24 h some marked specimens had reached the farthest
traps. Insect movement continued during the whole observation period. The ratio of
marked and unmarked insects on the traps allowed the estimation that around 2,000 C.
pruni individuals naturally occurred in the test plot. After application of Thiacloprid
no captures of insects originating from the first release were achieved. The number of
recaptured insects from the second release decreased to 10 and the number of unstained
individuals on the traps to 18. Spatial dispersal of stained individuals was reduced to the
close vicinity of the release tree. Insects were mainly recaptured within 24 hours after
release, after this period only two specimens were caught. Discussion

The incidence of new ESFY infections in an apricot orchard depends on the quantity
of vectors’ present, on the infection rates of the insects as well as on insect mobility
and numbers of trees that are visited by one individual. These tests showed that
fluorescent dyes provide an easy and effective marking tool for field studies on psyllid
density and movement. The selected pigments were stable for several weeks under
outdoor conditions including rain. There was no detectable effect of the dyes on
insect survival. Recaptures of marked C. pruni on the sticky traps proved a fast and frequent tree to tree
movement in insecticide-free orchards. Marked individuals easily covered distances up
to 24 m within 24 hours after release. After 8 days they were present in a large part
of the model orchards. All in all it seems likely that one infectious individual present
in an orchard visits and infects several apricot trees. ESFY transmission experiments
in the greenhouse revealed a minimum inoculation period of 1- 2 days (Carraro et
al., 2001). In theory a fast acting, enduring insecticide should therefore kill incoming
remigrants before inoculation of the trees, reduce insect numbers in orchards,
downsize movement of the vectors from tree to tree and in the end diminish rates of
new infections. Insecticide applications in experimental orchards, however, did not
show conclusive effects on disease spread (Poggi Pollini et a/., 2007). In general such
experiments are hampered by the fact that several years can elapse between inoculation
and development of visible disease symptoms, by the limits of the available diagnostic
procedures to detect low phytoplasma titers, and by the possibility that weak infections
of the starting plant material may remained undetected. These preliminary mark and recapture experiments allowed a clear visualization of
insecticide effects on psyllid survival and movement. Such experiments could contribute
to the development of appropriate management strategies. Thiacloprid significantly
reduced spread of marked insects and captures of unstained insects in both orchards. Especially in orchard 2 a striking effect was observed. The insecticide should therefore
also reduce disease spread as long as its effect lasts. 223

Chapter 5

The numbers of insects in these mark and recapture experiments were relatively small as
compared to other release experiments with psyllids. Van den Berg and Deacon (1988)
for example released a total of 25,000 Trioza erytreae in two experiments, Kobori et
al. (2011) carried out two experiments with 11,000 marked Diaphorina citri. In these
laboratory rearing experiments C. pruni produced high numbers of eggs which developed
into numerous springtime generation adults. Migration to conifers and hibernation
under artificial conditions, however, proved to be difficult (data not shown). Rearing
significant numbers of remigrants seemed hardly possible. Consequently hibernated
insects were captured in the field where their occurrence was limited. Nevertheless the
obtained recapture rates in untreated orchards enabled to draw the conclusions outlined
above although, also in these experiments, a higher number of released insects would
have been desirable. These results might represent a first step towards an appropriate sustainable
management of C. pruni but there is still a long way to go. In Austria the flight period
of the remigrants lasts at least for 6 weeks, starts in the first half of March and includes
the blossom period. In order to overcome these 6 weeks a combination of several
insecticides under consideration of bee activity will be required. Cold temperatures
and early developmental stages of the trees at the beginning of March might adversely
influence the effects of some insecticides. Authorization of insecticides and effects on
beneficial insects must be kept in mind. Last but not least the effects of the control
strategy on disease spread must be proven in field experiments. References

Abstract

“Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’, the causal agent of apple proliferation disease, is a quarantine
pathogen controlled by chemical treatments against insect vectors and eradication of diseased
plants. In accordance with the European guidelines, novel strategies should be developed for
sustainable management of plant diseases by using resistance inducers (e.g, endophytes). A
basic point for the success of this approach is the study of endophytic bacteria associated
with plants. In the present chapter, endophytic bacteria living in healthy and ‘Ca. P. mali’-
infected apple trees are described by cultivation-dependent and independent methods. The
165 rDNA sequence analysis showed the presence in apple of the groups Proteobacteria,
Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Chlamydiae, and Firmicutes, In detail, library
analyses underscored 24 and 17 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in healthy and
infected roots, respectively, with a dominance of Betaproteobacteria. Twelve and six isolates
with different morphology were isolated and characterized from healthy and infected roots
respectively. Different strains belonging to the genus Pseudomonas and Lysinibacillus showed
a minimum of five beneficial traits related to mineral nutrition (phosphate solubilization,

 

siderophores, nitrogen fixation), development (indolacetic acid synthesis), stress relief
(catalase activity), disease control (siderophores). These strains will be tested for in vivo
suppression of phytoplasma related diseases. Key words: endophytic bacteria, apple proliferation, 168 »RNA gene libraries, apple tree,
plane growth promotion. Introduction

Apple proliferation (AP), associated with the presence of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
mali, is one of the most important phytoplasma diseases in Europe. AP is a quarantine
pathogen vectored in nature by Cacopsylla picta and Cacopsylla melanoneura (Frisinghelli
et al., 2000; Tedeschi et a/., 2002). The management of AP mainly entails insecticide
treatment against the insect vectors and eradication of diseased plants, both having
a severe economic cost. Moreover, the new guidelines for the Common Agricultural
Policy of the European Community (Dir 128/2009) require the use of sustainable
agricultural practices with an eye on environmental safeguard. One of the most
innovative and promising solutions is the substitution of the insecticide treatments with
biotic (e.g. endophytes) and abiotic resistance inducers able to elicit the natural plant
defense responses. Recently, endophytic bacterial community associated with healthy

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

and phytoplasma infected plants has been screened (Bulgari et a/., 2009; Martini et al.,
2009) to find putative biocontrol agents. Endophytic bacteria are plant-associated microorganisms that live inside plant without
inducing symptoms of disease. Endophytic bacteria seem to positively influence plant-
host growth through mechanisms similar to those described for plant-growth promoting
rhizobacteria (PGPR). Moreover, they can promote plant growth by reducing the
deleterious effects of plant pathogens trough direct or indirect mechanisms (biocontrol)
(Lugtemberg and Kamilova, 2009). In detail, they are able to suppress pathogens
through the competition for an ecological niche, the production of allelochemicals
(e.g. antibiotic, siderophores, lytic enzymes) or through the induction of a systemic
plant defense response (ISR). The use of plant associated bacteria in plant protection is
related to the understanding of bacteria-host interactions and to the ability to formulate
and spread the bacteria under field conditions (Hallmann ef ad, 1998). A basic point
for the success of sustainable management of plant diseases based on biocontrol agents
is the study of endophytic bacterial community living inside plants. In this work, the
endophytic bacterial community associated with healthy and AP phytoplasma-infected
apple roots is described and screened in order to find potential biocontrol agents. Materials and methods

Plant material, DNA extraction and ‘Ca. P. mali’ detection

Apple roots were collected from five asymptomatic and five AP-symptomatic plants
during a field survey conducted in 2010 in north-western Italy. Roots were sterilized
and the total DNA was extracted following the method describe by Doyle and Doyle
(1990), with some modifications. Extracted DNA was used as template for ‘Ca. P. mali’
identification by (PCR)-based amplification of ribosomal RNA genes. In detail, ‘Ca. P.
mali’ was detected by the use of primer pairs fAT/rAS specific for 16SrX phytoplasma
group (Smart et al, 1996). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel and
visualized by UV transilluminator. Endophytic bacteria identification by cultivation-independent methods

Endophytic bacterial community associated with roots, from healthy and ‘Ca. P.
mali’-infected apple, was described by 16S rRNA gene library analyses. The bacterial
16S rDNA was amplified from total DNAs with bacterial universal primer pairs
799£/1492r (Chelius and Triplett, 2001). 16S rDNA bacterial specific bands were
excised and purified from the gel with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Purified products were cloned in the plasmid vector
pCRIL-TOPO (Invitrogen) and propagated in Escherichia coli as described (Shuman,
1994). The plasmid DNA of each clone was extracted from E. coli colonies with the
QIAGEN Plasmid Mini kit (QIAGEN), and sequenced with an ABI 3730 sequencer

Chapter 5

(Primm, Italy). Clone sequences were identified by comparison with National Center
of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database with the BLAST software
(hetp://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/BLAST/). All the 16S rRNA gene sequences from
clone libraries were clustered in Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with the
software Bioedit 7.0.9 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). Nucleotide
sequences sharing more than 97% identity were clustered in the same OTU. Nucleotide
sequences of one representative clone of each OTU were deposed at NCBI GenBank at
accession numbers from JQ291750 to JQ291790. Isolation and characterization of endophytic bacteria from roots by cultivation
Endophytic bacteria were identified by cultivation on different artificial media. Partial
volume of leaves homogenates (100 ul), serially diluted, was spread on Tryptic Soy Agar
(TSA) and Luria-Bertani (LB) agar medium. The samples were incubated at 30°C for 5
days. After growth, bacterial colonies were selected on the basis of phenotypic characters. Bacterial density in the roots was calculated as CFU/g. Total DNA from bacterial
colonies of root samples n. 1 and 4 (healthy plants), and n. 8 and 10 (infected plants)
was extracted by microLYSIS (Microzone) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 16S rRNA genes were amplified with the primers 27F and 1495R (Lane, 1991) following
PCR conditions previously described (Bulgari e¢ a/., 2009), and were sequenced with
an ABI 3730 sequencer (Primm). Sequences were identified by comparison with the
NCBI GenBank sequence database with the BLAST software. Nucleotide sequences
of representative isolated bacteria were deposited at NCBI GenBank database under
accession numbers from JQ291734 to JQ291749. 168 rRNA gene sequences were
clustered in a Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic dendrogram bootstrapped 1,000 times
with the software MEGA4 (Tamura et a/., 2007). The endophytic bacteria isolated on culture media were screened for plant growth
promotion (PGP) and biocontrol abilities. In detail, qualitative estimation of phosphate
solubilisation was carried out by observing a halo around colony growing on Pikovskaya’s
medium. Moreover, siderophore and indol acetic acid production and nitrogen fixation
were estimated as reported in literature (Alexander and Zuberer, 1991; Husen ef al.,
2009; Melo et al, 2011). Results and discussion

Detection of ‘Ca. P. mali’ in apple roots

‘Ca. P. mali’ detection in root samples was carried out using primers fAT/rAS which
target 16S rDNA and 16S-23S intergenic region of 16SrX phytoplasma group. Electrophoresis analysis showed a band of approximately 500 bp in all roots collected
from symptomatic apple trees. PCR products were also found in root samples n. 2, 3
and 5 that are from asymptomatic plants (Table 1). 228

Analysis of endophytic bacterial community by 16S rRNA gene libraries

Endophytic bacterial community had been characterized in a wide range of woody
and herbaceous plants (Lodewyckx e¢ a/., 2002), but no researches have described the
microbial diversity associated with apple trees. In this study, 16S rRNA gene libraries
from infected and uninfected apple roots were analyzed to describe the endophytic
bacterial community. A total of 120 clones were sequenced, 76 from the healthy roots
and 44 from the infected ones. The coverage of libraries from uninfected and infected
trees was 95% and 89% respectively. On the basis of sequence similarity, clone sequences of the two libraries were organized
in OTUs. These analyses allowed to estimate bacterial richness associated with healthy
and phytoplasma-infected apple roots. Most of the clones showed 298% sequence
similarity to the relative strains of GenBank. Twenty-four and 17 OTUs were identified
in the libraries from healthy and infected roots, respectively. These data showed that
bacterial diversity in healthy roots is higher than the one observed in infected ones. Also
in previous work, clone library analysis of plant-associated bacteria in ‘Ca. Liberibacter
asiaticus'’-infected and uninfected citrus roots evidenced differences in the composition
of their bacterial community (Trivedi er a/., 2010). The influence of pathogen infection
on endophytic bacterial community was also reported in healthy and phytoplasma-
infected grapevine leaves (Bulgari et a/., 2011). Such evidences, along with data from the
present study, suggest that uncultured bacterial pathogens can modify the composition
of endophytic bacterial communities associated with infected plants. The sequences related to Proteobacteria represented the largest fraction of clone libraries
(Figure 1). In detail, 7 and 5 OTUs of Betaproteobacteria group were identified in
healthy and infected roots libraries, respectively. In healthy roots, the major number of

229

Chapter 5

clones (19.6%) yielded the best matches with bacteria of the family Oxalobacteriaceae;
in infected roots, 10.8% of clones showed the highest similarity with bacteria of the
family Burkholderiaceae, genus Burkholderia. This bacterium has been reported as
endophyte of pathogen-infected plants (Bulgari e¢ a/., 2011), and in various uninfected
host plants such as potato, tomato, and grapevine (Bensalim e¢ a/., 1998; Onofre-Lemus
etal., 2009). Several strains are known to enhance disease resistance in plants, contribute
to better water management, and improve nitrogen fixation and overall host adaptation
to environmental stresses (Compant ef a/., 2008). MHealthy roots

Figure 1. Composition of 165 rRNA gene libraries at Operational level

The dominant OTU in healthy roots yielded best matches with Gammaproteobacteria
group, Pseudomonandaceae family, Pseudomonas fluorescens (15.7% of clones). Interestingly, the genus Psewdomonas was the sole bacterium found by cultivation-
dependent and independent methods in association with healthy and infected apple
trees. Pseudomonas is one of the most frequently occurring genera in plants (Lodewyckx
et al., 2002). Previous studies emphasized the potential of Pseudomonas fluorescens as
biocontrol agents of several plant diseases through the production of antibiotics, and
the activation of Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR) (Schouten ef al., 2004; Verhagen
etal.,2010). Endophytic bacterial community described by cultivation-dependent methods

The diversity of microbiota associated with healthy and phytoplasma-infected apple
roots was investigated both with cultivation-dependent and -independent methods
in order to increase the range of diversity explored in a sample. Before ‘Ca. P. mali’
detection in root samples, endophytic bacteria were isolated on TSA and LB from all

230

samples collected to calculate CFU/g. In healthy plants bacteria CFU/g were 10°, while
in diseased plants were 10°-10* (Table 1). Interestingly, the asymptomatic plants positive
to phytoplasma detection were characterized by a CFU comparable to symptomatic
plants. These findings are in agreement with the data reported in other studies (Bulgari

et al., 2011). Bacillus subtilis 1H2 (1Q291734)

Endophytic bacteria isolation was performed on healthy apple roots (sample n.
1 and n. 4) and on infected roots (sample n. 8 and n. 10). Twelve colonies with
different morphology were isolated from healthy roots and six colonies from infected
roots. Sequences of the 165 *RNA gene identified Firmicutes of the genus Bacillus,
Lysinibacillus and Paenibacillus; Gammaproteobacteria of the genus Pseudomonas
(Figure 2). In detail, Lysinibacillus and Paenibacillus were isolated respectively only
in healthy and AP-infected roots, while the other genera identified were shared by all
samples analyzed. Six different Bacillus species were isolated from healthy apple trees

232

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

and, among these, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus gibsonii were found also in
infected plants; Bacillus aquimaris was identified exclusively in phytoplasma-infected
roots. Interestingly, bacterial strains, here isolated, belong to genera widely studied for
developing biocontrol strategies to contain plant pathogens (Trivedi et a/., 2011). All the bacterial isolates were screened for their PGP and biocontrol abilities using
various qualitative and quantitative assays (Table 2). The major part of isolates showed
the ability to solubilize phosphate and detoxify hydrogen peroxide. Interestingly, some
strain e.g. Lysinibacillus fusiformis produced high amount of IAA. In conclusion, some of the endophytic bacteria identified and characterized in the
present study in healthy and phytoplasma-infected apple trees have been reported as
biocontrol agents against different plant pathogens. This finding opens the possibility
to in-depth investigate the action of those bacteria against ‘Ca. P. mali’ with the aim to
project novel strategies for AP disease containment. References

Abstract

Symptomatic grapevines infected by “flavescence dorée” (FD) and its vector Scaphoideus
titanus are more present in vineyards untreated with insecticides, Information on vineyard to
vineyard mobility of vectors are nceded to understand the risk posed by the vineyards in which
there is no S. titanus control. To address this issue, a research was carried out in two localities
in north-east Italy where a cultivated untreated vineyard contiguous to a cultivated treated
vineyard are present, Results proved that the S. titanus can move ftom untreated vineyards to
contiguous vineyards where insecticides are specifically applied for its control. The majority
of adults were captured within 40-50 m from untreated vineyard, even if some individuals
were captured at 80-100 m. The risk posed by grapevines untreated with insecticides against
the 5. titanus for FD spread in other vineyards is confirmed by the results obtained here. Moreover, results stress that insecticide applications for FD infections’ risk reduction can be
ineffective if untreated FD-infected grapevines are present in the surrounding areas. Key words: “flavescence dorée”, Scaphoideus titanus, vectors moving, untreated vineyards,
insecticides. Introduction

The “flavescence dorée” (FD) is a grapevine yellows disease causing severe damage in
European vineyards. The phytoplasma agent of the disease, is transmitted also in Italy
from grapevine to grapevine by the leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus Ball (Homoptera:
Cicadellidae) (Bianco et al., 2001; Mori et al., 2002). In various surveys carried out on
grapevines untreated with insecticides (cultivated or abandoned) high population levels
of S. titanus were found (Pavan et al., 2005; 2012; Lessio and Alma, 2006; Lessio et al.,
2007). The highest population of the vector and the highest percentage of symptomatic
grapevines were found in cultivated vineyards where insecticides against S. titanus
are not applied (Pavan ef al., 2005; 2012; Bressan et al., 2005). Therefore, infectious
vectors moving from these vineyards can represent a potential risk for other vineyards. It should be noted that, insecticide treatments against the vector are compulsory only in
grape-growing areas where FD is present (Barba, 2005; Pavan ef al., 2005a). These areas
are annually identified by the local governments, however in other areas, insecticides
against S. titanus may not be applied despite the presence of the vector. Furthermore,

235

Chapter 5

insecticides applied against other pests (e.g. grape berry mouth), may not be effective
against S. titanus. Information on vineyard to vineyard mobility of S. titanus are needed to understand the
risk posed by the vineyards with no S. titanus control on other vineyards. To address this
issue a research was performed in Italy to study the mobility of S. sitanus adults between
contiguous untreated and treated vineyards. Materials and methods

The research was carried out in two localities in north-east Italy where a cultivated
untreated vineyard contiguous to a cultivated treated vineyard are present. Year 2011. Breganze location (45°42.43’ N - 11°34.50’ E, 117 m a.s.l. ), Merlot and
Cabernet Sauvignon cultivars, “espalier” training system at a distance of 3.5 m x 0.9 m.
The treated (two applications /year organophosphate and neonicotinoid against young
stages) and untreated vineyards were 1.92 and 1.35 ha, respectively. The rows were
north-south oriented on the untreated vineyards, east-west on the treated one. Year 2012. Lonigo location (45°24.05’ N - 11°23.24’ E, altitude 32 m a.sl. ), Garganega
cultivar, “pergola” training system at a distance of 4.0 m x 1.0 m. The treated (two
applications with organophosphate per year against young stages) and untreated
vineyards were 1.04 and 1.06 ha, respectively. The vineyard rows were north-south
oriented in both vineyards. No other vineyards were present at the borders of the investigated fields. In both
vineyards, the presence and flight dynamics of S. titanus were monitored every two
weeks from July to October by using yellow sticky traps (SuperColor Giallo’, Serbios)
positioned according to a regular grid design (approx. 30 m x 30 m). Each trap was geo-
referred using GPS. All traps were analysed under dissection microscope in laboratory
and captured S. titanus adults were counted. Data were analysed using SADIE (Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs) red—blue
methodology (Perry et a/., 1999), to detect spatial patterns in S. titanus cumulative
captures. At each sampling point the local contribution to a group (cluster) of relatively
high-density (patch) or to a group of zero or relatively small counts (gap) was assessed. Tests of non-randomness based on the overall index of aggregation (Ia) and on the
average indexes of clustering into patch ( Vi ) and into gap ( vj) were performed («= 0.05)
using kriging with SURFER (Golden Software Inc., CO), indexes of local aggregation
(vis vj) and catches were interpolated and used in the design of a two-dimensional map
showing their spatial distribution. Results and discussion

S. titanus adults were captured in both untreated and treated vineyards, however the
captures were significantly higher in the untreated ones (Figures 1-3). Significant
clustering into patch was detected in the distribution of S. titanus observed during the

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

two years (p < 0.05). S. titanus resulted aggregated in untreated vineyards, however
also in treated vineyards, particularly in 2011 some patches were found. In both grape-
growing areas a decreasing gradient of S. titanus captures was observed from untreated
to treated grapevines. Results proved that the vector can move from untreated to
contiguous vineyards where insecticides are specifically applied for its control. The
majority of adults were captured within 40-50 m from untreated vineyard confirming

the low mobility reported in previous
surveys (Lessio and Alma, 2004;
Beanland e¢ al., 2006, Pavan et al.,
2012), even if some individuals were
captured at 80-100 m. The migration
of S. titanus adults from untreated
vineyards started at the beginning of
August and the maximum number
of captures on treated vineyard was
registered at the end of August. 2011

The risk posed by grapevines untreated with insecticides against the S. titanus for FD
spread in other vineyards is confirmed by the results obtained here. Results stress that
insecticide applications for FD infections’ risk reduction can be ineffective if untreated
FD-infected grapevines are present in the surrounding areas. Acknowledgements

Abstract

Ficld trials were conducted in 2011 to investigate the short distance spread of adult
Scapboideus titanus from grapevine arbours to either a commercial vineyard or to grapevine
cultivar Chardonnay trap plants. In all locations the vector of “flavescence dorée” (FD) actively
moved from the arbour to the Chardonnay trap plants and to the vineyard, The rate of the
migrating population was between 0 and 7.1%, the maximum spread distance was 75 meters. In addition, 41 arbours in the municipality Tieschen in south-east Styria were tested for FD
presence, The 5% of the grapevine arbours were positive. From these findings it is concluded
that grape arbours act as a reservoir for both S. titanus and ED from which a small percentage
of the vector population spreads to nearby vineyards, In areas where they are widespread,
grapevine arbours are an important factor in the epidemiology of FD, therefore they should
be considered in the management strategy. Key words: phytoplasma, reservoir host plants, spread, vector, viticulture. Introduction

In 2004, Schapoideus titanus was found for the first time in Austrian vineyards in
southeast Styria. In 2009, single grapevine plants and some wild plant species in this area
have been detected to be infected with the “flavescence dorée” (FD) phytoplasma. Since
then the vector of FD has spread and is established in parts of Styria and Burgenland
2013. FD was detected hitherto only locally in south and southeast Styria (Zeisner,
2009; Reisenzein and Steffek, 2011; AGES, 2013). Grape arbours and hedges are traditionally cultivated and commonly present in
southeast Styria; American grapevines that are often used for grape arbours are usually
not subject to insecticide treatments and therefore support high population levels of S.
titanus. Consequently, such arbours may act as a source of both the vector and the FD
phytoplasma. Furthermore, American grapevine usually do not show symptoms of this
grapevine yellows disease (Lessio e¢ al., 2007). The research project VitisCLIM was intitiated to model spread and impact of FD
and its vector in Austria (Steffek et a/., 2011). Data from scientific literature on the
epidemiology and the spatial spread dynamics of S. titanus were reviewed for the spread
model. Moreover, field trials were conducted in summer 2011 to assess the percentage

239

Chapter 5

and flight distance of S. titanus population that migrate from untreated arbours. In
addition, the FD infection level of grapevine arbours was determined in a survey in the
municipality Tieschen. Material and methods

Short distance spread

The trials to study short distance spread of S. titanus were conducted in three locations in
southeast Styria and Slovenia in 2011. A weather station was placed inside the vineyard
to record rainfall, wind direction and speed (above the canopy) and temperatures (in
the canopy) to interprete conditions of vector spread. Location 1 consisted of a vineyard with an approximately 30 year old plot planted with
the grapevine cultivars Welschriesling, WeiSburgunder and Miiller Thurgau, a four year
old vineyard planted with cultivars Weifburgunder and Muskateller, and a new (2011)
planted Chardonnay vineyard. A grapevine arbour was present 38 m air-line distance
from the new planted vineyard and 75 m from the first row and upper edge of the old
part of the vineyard. The arbour consisted of a mixture of wild Vitis sp. (V. labrusca, V.
riparia) and Vitis vinifera. Location 2 was an untreated arbour located in southeast Styria from which it was
known that an established S. titanus population was present. Location 3 consisted of an untreated arbour with high numbers of S. sitanus close to
grapevines in a private garden. Field sampling of S. titanus nymphs

The number of S. titanus nymphs (L1 and L2) on five leaves of 40 plants was counted in
the arbour and in the vineyard at four dates (30.05., 09.06., 21.06., 08.07.2011). At the
beginning of the experiment 164 nymphs were counted mainly in the old vineyard, Due
to an insecticide application (Chlorpyrifos-methyl) after the first assessment (30.05.) the nymphs in the vineyard dropped to very low numbers during the subsequent
assessments (5, 2 and 3). Maximum carrying capacity

The maximum carrying capacity of S. titanus in a grape arbour was determined for the
spread model as it was assumed that adults spread when the maximum carrying capacity
is reached. The number of S. titanus nymphs was assessed in three untreated arbours by counting
the first and second instars on an arbour surface area of 2500 cm? (date: 28.06.2012). The counts were conducted in various heights of the grape arbours and replicated 18
times. The average number of nymphs on 2500 cm’ was extrapolated to 1 m’. This value
was used to calculate the maximum number of nymphs in an untreated grapevine in an
arbour. Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

Figure 1. Principle set-up used to assess the
short distance spread of S. titanus adults
from grapevine arbours to trap plant groups
(arrows). Location 2 grape arbour and two
out of four cultivars. Chardonnay trap plant
groups that were planted around the arbour
in the main cardinal points. in each trap plant
group and in the arbour one yellow sticky
trap was placed. Vector migration from arbours

To assess the percentage and flight distance of migrating populations of S. titanus from
untreated arbours (source of the vector), trap plants groups of 5-6 one year old grapevines
of cultivar Chardonnay were used. They were propagated in an insect proof greenhouse
and planted in various distances from the source in early July, shortly before adults appear. Yellow sticky traps (yst) (Rebell’ giallo) were placed in the grape arbours, in the cultivar
Chardonnay trap plants, at the border of the 30 years old vineyard and randomly in
both the 30 years and the 4 years old vineyard at location 1. The sides of the traps were
labeled to trace if the catched S. titanus individuals were on the side facing towards the
grape arbour. Traps were changed on a weekly interval between 14th of July and 29th of September. The principle of the set-up in locations is shown in Figure 1. In order to detect a
relationship between the location of trapped S. titanus and the arbour, results were
analysed with the inverse distance weightening function (Shepard, 1968). “Flavescence dorée” infection survey of grape arbours

In autumn 2011, a survey was carried out within a focus zone in southeats Styria to
detect the infection level of grapevine arbours with the FD phytoplasma. The extraction
of the phytoplasmas from plant samples was done according to Seemiiller et al. (1994). A real-time PCR assay was used for FD detection (Angelini et a/., 2007). Results

Maximum carrying capacity

The results of the counts in the arbours are presented in table 1. A grapevine in an
arbour is estimated to cover a leaf area of 3.6 m*in average (http://www.rebschule-
meier.ch/PDF/Reben_Haus_Garten.pdf). Based on this estimation and on the results
of the larval counts in the arbour, the maximal carrying capacity of a plant in an arbour
was set to 288 leafhoppers of larval stage L1. Chapter 5

Sampling results

The distribution of S. titanus nymphs in the vineyard is aggregated with a higher
density at the borders compared to inside the vineyard (Figure 2). Furthermore nymphs
are distributed along rows. More larvae are present in the 30 years old vineyard (159)
compared to the 4 years old vineyard (15). Figure 3 shows the total counts of nymphs of the single sampled plants illustrated as
inverse distance weighting. Vector migration from arbours

At the end of July, adults of S. titanus were found for the first time in the cultivar
Chardonnay trap plant group closest (2 m) to the grape arbour and at the border of the
old vineyard. The maximum number of S. titanus catched was in the middle of August
(8 specimens of S. titanus adults). Six of these individuals were present in the trap placed
at the edge of the old vineyard and one individual was recorded in the trap plant group
located 2 m away from the arbour. All adults in the old vineyard and the trap plants were
catched on the trap side facing towards the grape arbour. In total, 329 S. sitanus adults were caught in the grape arbour, 2 in the cultivar
Chardonnay group which was two meters away from the arbour, 26 in the 30 years old
vineyard and 3 in the four year old vineyard. The results of migrated S. titanus adult in the three locations from grape arbours are
summarised in Table 2. The table shows catches of two opposite yellow sticky traps
(arbour as source; trap plant as sink). In all three locations the vector actively moved
from the arbour to the cultivar Chardonnay trap plant. Depending on the trap, the rate
of the catches of the migrating population was between 0 and 7.1%. S. titanus adults
spread from the arbour to the old part of the vineyard at least 75 m in location 1. Table 2. Results of the migration experiments: comparison of catches of S. titanus adults in two opposite yellow

The main variety of the investigated grape arbours was Isabella. In two out of 41
examined grape arbours the FD phytoplasma was detected (Figure 4). None of the
arbours displayed grapevine yellows symptoms. Furthermore, the FD positive arbours
were also only latent infected. Consideration shall be given to the possible risk as
infection source, when these data are expressed in relative terms, which means 5% FD
infected arbours in the fourth year after the first FD detection. Conclusions

First S. titanus adults were recorded on the yellow sticky traps at the end of July with most
individuals present in the middle of August. No catches were recorded when the weather
was cold and wet. More S. titanus were recorded in the old (30 years) vineyard compared
to the young vineyard (4 years), this can be explained by the vector preference for dense
canopies and old wood for oviposition. However it can also be attributed to the spatial
proximity of the old vineyard to the grape arbour where a higher numbers of S. titanus were
recorded in the rows, close to the arbour than in the center and the far sides. It was assumed
that the arbour acted as source for the migrating S. titanus adults. A further indication for
this assumption may be the fact that in the rows close to the arbour all captured S. titanus
adults were present on the yellow sticky trap side facing towards the arbour. Spread dynamics of S. titanus was investigated in only few studies (Lessio and Alma,
2004). Lessio et al. (2007) found no significant differences in the captures of S. titanus
adults on traps placed at the border and inside a vineyard and that this leafhopper is
unlikely to perform considerable flights from American grapevine to close vineyards. In the study by Lessio and Alma (2004) hardly no catches were recorded in traps 24
m away from the vineyard. However, other authors report a distinct border effect with
a decreasing gradient of S. titanus adult captures observed from contiguous untreated
grapevines (Pavan ef al., 2012). 244

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

Results obtained from this research showed that more S. titanus were recorded in traps
placed at the borders of the vineyard and at the edge close to the grape arbour than inside. These findings are in accordance with Maixner et al. (1993) who observed that adult S.
titanus migrated into the peripheral parts of commercial vineyards at the end of the season. Based on the results of the migration experiments it is concluded that S. sitanus adults
spread from the grape arbour to the vineyard over a distance of at least 75 m and that
an average 3.9% of a given S. titanus population migrated from an arbour with a high
population density. Those individuals probably spread to the nearest attractive host
plants available to lay eggs and form new populations in the following year. Obviously
S. titanus adults were more attracted by the dense canopies of old grapevines than by
the small groups of cultivar Chardonnay trap plants. The proximity of the old vineyard
to the arbour had more influence on the number of S. titanus catches than the different
cultivars in this study. Ic is concluded that grapevine arbours may be an important factor in the epidemiology
of FD if they are present in very high number in an area, In the municipality of Tieschen
for example 505 arbours and hedges are registered on an area of 18.17 km* (2012). In
such a case the disease might spread rapidly even when the vector occurs in only a small
number of the grape arbours. Grape arbours pose another risk because Vitis riparia can
be infected with FD but usually does not show symptoms (Maixner et a/., 1993). From the results of this study it can be concluded that grape arbours act as a reservoir
for S. titanus from which they spread to nearby vineyards and other arbours. Therefore
grape arbours are an important factor with regard to epidemiology of FD and should be
considered in the management strategy. References

Abstract

‘The grapevine “flavescence dorée” phytoplasma is included in the list of quarantine pathogens
of the European Union and in the lise A2 of EPPO. Official control and eradication
measures are enforced. Following its recent detection in Portugal, additional emergency
measures were established (Portuguese legislation 976/2008, 1 September). The programs
procedures, which can be carried out into a national plan regarding the compulsory control
of FD, include both the control of S. sitanus and the removal of infected plants in infection
‘foci. The control of S. titanus, which has been imposed to grapevine nurseries, is mandatory
for all vineyards in the region, and is based on one or more seasonal spraying procedures,
depending on epidemic risk, Removal of FD infected grapevines has been done by uprooting
all symptomatic plants. Key words: Scaphoideus titanus, “flavescence dorée’”, disease, Portugal. Introduction

“Flavescence dorée” (FD) is a grapevine disease that affects several production areas in
Europe, namely in Portugal (Sousa et a/., 2003), it is associated with the presence of a
phytoplasma belonging to 16SrV group and transmitted also in Portugal vineyards by
the leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus Ball (Cicadellidae) (Quartau e¢ al., 2001; Sousa et
al.,2009). From 2006 there was an increase in the presence of S. titanus in the northern regions of
Portugal and in 2008 the insect has been detected for the first time in the central region,
showing an increase of dispersion in the first two years. During 2011 it was however
observed a containment in its spreading that can be attributed to the implementation
of mandatory law measures. In 2010, its presence was detected for the first time on the
island of Madeira. On the other hand the disease it is still restricted to north region of
Portugal (Figure 1). 246

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

Despite the phytosanitary measures taken
by the Regional Agricultural Services
coordinated by the National Plant
Protection Authority, the disease is not yet
under control, so it becomes necessary to
strengthen the ongoing actions and define
additional measures involving the grapevine
and wine producers. It was also pointed out that there were several
constraints to prevent the spread of the insect, 5 §
namely the technical and logistical difficulty
that regional services have in the control of ee ci
application of the recommended insecticide
treatments. Not collective performing of
those treatments and poor dissemination
of information to individual growers as well
the predominance of small vineyards do not
help the disease eradication. Another major
constraint concerns the limited number of Figure 1. Presence of “flavescence dorée” in
approved insecticides in Portugal. Portugal (2012). PAN-FD’s main objectives

Contain the disease within the wine-growing regions where it is declared and reducing
to a minimum the impact on the grape production and wine industry in these regions is
the major focus of this new research project. The strategy of medium-term actions that can contribute to eradicating the disease, or, if
it will be not possible, to reduce the presence of the disease to acceptable phytosanitary
and economic levels was undertaken. Ensuring the health of grapevine propagation
material and the confidence and sustainability of national nursery industry is also seeked. Some of these measures include grapevine sampling surveys, containment measures of
insect vector and eradication measures. The main factors that contribute to the technical difficulty in the implementation
of legislative measures to eradicate the “flavescence dorée” disease in Portugal are
summarized in Figure 2. Several different kinds of new measures are included in this “FD-Plan of Action” that
is an important tool to better assess the actual spreading of the disease and of the insect
vector. To support the implementation of measures in the field, the adaptation of the
“Information System of Vine and Wine - Sivy” managed by the “Portuguese Institute
of Vine and Wine” and based on data obtained from plots geo-referenced will be

247

Chapter 5

used (Figure 3). The adaptation of Sivv will enable the inclusion and processing of
information already obtained and the data originate in future surveys of disease and
insect vector presence, thus facilitating the definition of the “Priority Intervention
Zones - ZIP” (Figure 4), for which particular phytosanitary measures are applied. Ic is expected to include in Sivy the information already compiled of official surveys as well as
the identification of vineyards in organic production, the fields of mother plants of rootstocks
and varieties as well nurseries. Any other disease existing in the plots will also be registered. The involvement and responsibility of various public and private bodies identified in
the FD-Plan of Action when applying the various actions envisaged are critical to its
application, not forgetting the key role of grapevine growers, winemakers, nurserymens. Several other aspects are included as the implementing measures defined for the
vineyard organic farming, as well as the abandoned vineyards, reinforcement of training
activities, information and awareness to farmers, official and private inspections. Diagnosis visual and

the disease. The utilization of ZIPs together with the “National Service Avisos” will
permit to apply only the number of chemical treatments required to control the S.
titanus and the spread of the disease. Preventive measures, such as the use of healthy certified propagation material and the
respect of quarantine measures, are the most important approaches to reduce the risk of
epidemic spreading of FD phytoplasma in areas where the disease is still not present. The
control of the local vector populations and the elimination of infected plants are good
agricultural practices that reduce the risk of contamination. Despite these measures,
S. titanus is progressing along the Portuguese coast as FD disease. At the end of 2012
several stakeholders (government, researchers, farmers, nurserymen’s representatives and
wine organizations) have joined in order to prepare a National Action Plan to control
the FD disease in the country called by PAN-FD (PAN-FD DGAY 2013), setting up
new intervention measures for strengthening the existing ones. References

Abstract

Recovery isa spontaneous process that leads diseased plants back to the original asymptomatic
condition. It occurs in perennial plants infected by different pathogens, and phytoplasmas in
particular, however the precise causes of recovery are still not known. Biotic or abiotic factors
are involved, but also agronomical management may play a role. Recovery can be permanent
or transient; in the case of permanent recovery plants can also show resistance or tolerance
to disease. In the literature examples are known of diseased plants that can recover from
symptoms but not from the pathogen (e.g. apricot from European stone fruit yellows, ESFY),
and plants that can recover from both symptoms and the agent (e.g. grapes from grapevine
yellows, GY). It has been shown that an acquired tolerance to ESFY is transmissible to the
progeny by grafting. Recovered plants can represent an opportunity in the management of
plant diseases in areas where diseases are endemic. They can be used as a source of resistant or
tolerant material to replace rogued plants. Morphological, physiological and genetic changes
have been studied in the recent past in recovered plants. On the basis of this knowledge,
recovery can be considered as a signal of inducible resistance. Key words: phytoplasma diseases, tolerance, resistance, ESFY, GY. Introduction

Since immunity to pathogens is not a common condition for many cultivated plant-
species, disease is an expected event in plants exposed to natural inoculation pressure. In fact, plants - as well as animals - are normally exposed to a range of biotic and
abiotic stresses. Animals have evolved various immune system mechanisms to combat
pathogens. For animals, recovery is generally retained as a common phenomenon,
which occurs after infection and disease. However, this situation has no correspondence
in diseased plants, in which recovery is not a predictable event. Nevertheless, in recent years recovery has become a phenomenon better understood and
considered effective also for diseased plants. According to the most recent discoveries it
is appropriate to say that plants, like animals, can recover and recovery is described as
the ability to spontaneously return to a non-symptomatic state (Caudwell, 1961; Kunze,
1976). The real recovery is when the phenomenon is permanent and not transient. In
particular, the current opinion regarding phytoplasma diseases is that real recovery is when
symptoms have been absent for at least three consecutive years (Maixner et al., 2011). Recovery from phytoplasma diseases is well known in perennial crops. The most
relevant examples are: apple recovered from apple proliferation (AP) (Kunze, 1976;
Seemiiller et a/., 1984; Osler et al., 2000; Carraro et al., 2004; Musetti et al., 2004),

pear from pear decline (PD) (Giunchedi e¢ a/., 1995), stone fruits from European stone
fruit yellows (ESEY) (Morvan et al, 1986; Castelain et al., 1997; Osler et al., 2000;
2014; Kison and Seemiiller, 2001; Musetti et a/., 2005; Poggi Pollini e¢ a/., 2012), and
grapevine from yellows (GY), “flavescence dorée” (FD) (Caudwell, 1961; 1966; Osler
et al., 2000; 2002; Musetti er a/., 2007), and “bois noir” (BN) (Osler e¢ al., 1993; 2000;
Garau et al., 2008; Romanazzi et al., 2007; Angelini e a/., 2010; Maixner et a/., 2011;
Ermacora ef a/., 2011). This intriguing phenomenon has been also reported for virus
diseases (Smith, 1999; Conti and Faoro, 2012), and in such cases the involvement of
RNA silencing mechanisms has been hypothesized (Jovel e¢ a/., 2007). Recovery and phytoplasma diseases

Several examples are reported below about recovery from phytoplasma diseases of
grapevine and economically important fruit trees in Europe. Grapevines and FD. The first observed and described case of recovery from phytoplasma
diseases was a French work on grapevine recovery from FD (Caudwell, 1961). Later
on, studies on the recovery from FD were also reported outside France (Osler e¢ al,
2000; 2002; Carraro e¢ al., 2009). The phenomenon is influenced by both scion
and rootstock. A number of worldwide known grapevine varieties, like Chardonnay,
Prosecco, Pinot, and Merlot, quite frequently recover from FD (Caudwell et al., 1987;
Bianco et al., 2002; Osler et al., 2002; Morone et a/., 2007) with an annual mean rate of
about 20% (Osler e¢ a/., 2012). In contrast, the cultivar Perera does not recover, in all the
conditions studied so far (Pavan et al., 1997). The Prosecco district in Veneto Region
represented an impressive case where recovery was so efficient that it solved an FD
epidemic: three million symptomatic grapevines recovered within four years from the
first symptoms (Osler et a/., 2002). Recently, it has been demonstrated that grapevines
recover from both symptoms and the agent (Morone ef a/., 2007). Recovered plants can
become infected and symptomatic again, but with a lower percentage when compared
with grapevines that were never infected, indicating that recovery is linked to a form of
inducible resistance (Ryals e¢ a/., 1996; Durrant and Dong, 2004; Vallad and Goodman,
2004; Musetti, 2010). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that uprooting can increase
the annual recovery rate up to 70% (Osler e¢ a/., 2002; Carraro et al., 2008). Grapevines and BN. The general behaviour of grapevine recovery from BN (Osler et
al., 1993; Mutton et al., 2002; Bellomo et al., 2007; Maixner et a/., 2011) is similar to the
one of FD (Caudwell et a/., 1987). In particular, recovery can be strongly influenced by
pruning: in the case of pollarding, annual recovery rates can be increased up to 65-80%
(Reggiani et a/., 2008; Carraro et al., 2008; Riedle-Bauer et al., 2010; Romanazzi et al.,
2008; Bianco et al., 2002; Garau et al., 2007; Bellomo et al., 2007). Moreover, recovery
seems to be influenced by rootstock typology: its annual rate is considerably lower on
rootstock 420A (Romanazzi et al. 2008; Ermacora et al., 2011). Similar to FD-infected
grapevines, uprooting or partial uprooting can increase the recovery percentage (Osler et
al, 1993; 2002; Romanazzi and Murolo, 2008). Recently, it has also been demonstrated

251

Chapter 5

that the application of resistance inducers can promote the recovery of BN-infected
grapevines with no adverse effects on the plants (Romanazzi et al., 2009; 2013). Stone fruits and ESFY. Most of the work on recovery from ESFY has been carried
out on apricots; the first experiments were reported in France by Morvan ef al. (1986). The authors demonstrated that apricot plants are able to recover from severe symptoms,
even though the proportions can be low. Interestingly, the recovered trees were shown to
harbour avirulent or hypo-virulent strains of the pathogen (Morvan et al., 1986; 1991;
Castelain e¢ al., 1997). This suggests that the hypo-virulent strains might protect the
plants from subsequent challenges by severe strains. In fact, plants grafted by using buds
from recovered trees were shown to be resistant to the disease (Morvan et al., 1986). Similar experiments were carried out in Italy confirming that symptomatic apricot
plants do recover completely from symptoms, even if the percentage is low (Osler et
al., 2000). The cause of recovery was recently interpreted as the result of an induced
tolerance (Osler et al., 2014) instead of a cross-protection process (Morvan et al.,
1986; Marcone ef al., 2010). It was also confirmed that plants obtained from recovered
mothers continued to exhibit tolerance, and that the recovery tendency is transmissible
from recovered mothers to progeny by grafting. As proposed by Morvan and colleagues
in 1986, it is of primary interest that a “transmissible factor” seems to exist in plants
propagated from recovered mothers. As for grapevines, the recovery capacity in apricots
is also highly influenced by the rootstock (Osler et a/., 2014). Concerning other stone
fruit species, Japanese plums are also reported to recover from ESFY. The cultivar Shiro
recovers very efficiently but Ozark Premier quite rarely. European plum varieties are
strongly tolerant to ESFY and therefore it is not possible to verify the recovery from
symptoms (Carraro et al., 1998; Osler et al., 2000). Apple and AP. Apples can recover ftom AP (Kunze, 1976; Seemiiller ef al, 1984; Osler
et al 2000; Carraro et al., 2004), but in the most specialised fruit growing areas rouging
of symptomatic plants and insecticide vector-control are preferred instead of stimulating
a recovery. Also, some scab resistant cultivars like Florina can recover from AP (Loi et al,
1995) with an annual rate of about 20% (Osler et a/., 2012). In recent observations in
northeastern Italy, apple cultivars grafted on EM 106 may recover efficiently and stably
from AP. Recovery occurs from both the symptoms and the agent in the crown, but not
in the roots where phytoplasmas survive (Seemiiller e a/., 1984). Plants that recover can
eventually become symptomatic again, but to a minor extent (4.1 fold less) in comparison
to newly infected plants (Osler ef a/., 2000). This confirms the hypothesis that recovery
can be linked to a type of induced resistance. However, in the case of apple it is not yet
clear whether this kind of inducible resistance is transmissible by grafting. Direct primary causes of recovery in phytoplasma diseased plants

Recovery is a phenomenon that can be promoted and influenced by different factors
and agronomic practices (Kunze, 1976). Although important physiological and genetic
bases of recovery have been discovered, very little is known about its origin. Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

The hypothesized causes of recovery include: i) interaction of pathogenic strains with
non-pathogenic microbial community; ii) host plant reaction to the pathogen; iii)
environmental conditions and agronomical practices. Concerning point i), one common hypothesis is based on the active presence in the
plant of hypovirulent strains of the pathogen (Morvan et al., 1986; 1991; Castellain et
al, 1997; Musetti et al., 2005; Loi et al., 2008; Ermacora et al., 2010). Avirulent strains
have been proposed as responsible for cross-protection reactions that protect plants
from attacks by virulent pathogens (Kison and Seemiiller, 2001; Marcone ef al., 201 0b). So far, a great genetic variability has been described for “Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum’ and ‘Ca. P. mali’ (Martini e¢ a/., 2010; Danet e¢ a/., 2011), and a substantial
effort has been made to differentiate hypo and hyper-virulent strains (Seemiiller e¢
al. 2011). The involvement of endophytic fungal and bacterial microorganisms is
also reported as a possible cause of recovery (Musetti ef a/., 2007; Martini ef a/., 2009;
Bulgari et a/., 2011; Bianco et al., 2012). About point ii), a plant-mediated process is reported to govern inducible resistances/
tolerances (Musetti ef a/., 2013; Osler er al., 2014). The factors involved in such plant
responses (Durrant and Dong, 2004; Ahmad and Eveillard, 2011) are also assumed to
be the possible causes of recovery (Musetti ef a/., 2013; Osler et al., 2014). Regarding point iii), pollarding and strong pruning are reported to increase the
probability of recovery (Reggiani et al, 2008; Carraro ef al, 2008; Riedle-Bauer ef
al. 2010). Moreover, recovery was proved to be inducible by transplanting grapevines
infected by FD or BN. For example, Chardonnay cultivar grapevines showing severe
symptoms of yellows, were transplanted in April and six months later recovered at a
rate of 66% (Osler e¢ al., 1993). These results were confirmed in different regions of
Italy (Zucchetto, 1998; Carraro et al., 2008). This intriguing reproducible recovery
is possibly linked to an inducible resistance promoted by wounding/stress, which has
already been proposed for fungus diseases (Francia et al, 2007). Further research is
needed to confirm this fascinating and promising theory. As mentioned previously, also
the application of resistance inducers is an agronomical practice for inducing recovery
in BN-infected grapevines (Romanazzi et al., 2009; 2013). Morphological, physiological and genetic changes in recovered plants

The physiological basis of recovery is not completely known, however, during recent
years studies have been carried out with the aim of gaining new insights into the
phenomenon. Cytochemical analyses have revealed that recovery is accompanied by
biochemical changes in the phloem. It has been demonstrated that recovered plants are
able to accumulate H,O, in the sieve elements, this is a stable reactive oxygen species
whose antimicrobial and signalling roles are well known. It has also been observed in
these plants that the activities of two main enzymatic H,O, scavengers (catalase and
ascorbate peroxidases) are selectively and stably down regulated (Musetti e¢ al., 2004;
2005; 2007). The variation of the sieve-element oxidative status leads to modifications of

Chapter 5

phloem protein (P-protein) conformation and phloem occlusion expression patterns. An anomalous accumulation of callose and protein associated with the up-regulation
of callose synthase- and P-protein- coding genes has been observed in the sieve elements
of recovered apple trees (Musetti, 2010). This is supporting the hypothesis that
recovered plants are able to develop resistance mechanisms dependent on Ca* signal
activity (Musetti, 2010; Musetti ef a/., 2013). Recently, the activation of the jasmonate
(JA)-related defence mechanism via JA gene up-regulation has also been demonstrated
in apple trees recovered from apple proliferation disease (Patui et a/., 2013; Musetti et
al, 2013). Regarding grapevine and BN interaction, the possible involvement of callose, as well as
callose synthase, sugar transporters, and cell wall invertase genes, has been investigated
during infection and after recovery (Santi et a/., 2013). Ultrastructural investigation of
leaf tissue showed that callose accumulated in the sieve elements of diseased grapevine. Moreover, two genes encoding for callose synthase were up regulated in the infected
leaves. Expression analysis showed that also sucrose transport and cleavage were
severely affected by BN phytoplasma presence, that induced the establishment of a
carbohydrate sink in the source leaf, and this is in agreement also with that obligate
biotroph pathogens acquire most of their nutrients from the host plant. Interestingly,
whereas the transcript level of sucrose synthase in recovered plants was similar to the
one in healthy plants, sucrose transporters as well as cell wall invertase were expressed to
a greater degree in recovered leaves than in the healthy ones. These results indicate that
recovered plants seem to acquire structural and molecular changes leading to increases
in sucrose transport ability and defence signalling (Santi e¢ a/., 2013). Applications of recovery in phytoplasma-disease control and concluding remarks

The conventional attempts to control the phytoplasma epidemic diseases (rouging of
the sources of inoculum, use of healthy plants to replace the infected ones and vector
control) do not work in practice (Osler er a/., 2003). Moreover, at present no resistant or
tolerant cultivars are available against phytoplasma diseases. In such a situation, recovery
may represent a chance to control phytoplasma diseases (Osler et al., 2012). There are two ways to approach recovery: direct or indirect recovery, depending on
the annual recovery rate and stability. For FD- and BN-infected grapevines, in which
recovery is generally efficient, a direct recovery could be tried. This strategic plan was
largely confirmed to be effective in the area of Prosecco (Italy) and it is more cost-
effective than uprooting (Pavan et a/., 2012). The spontaneously recovered grapevines
revealed that they carry also a persistent resistance to FD. Similar observations were
reported by Ermacora et al. (2011) regarding cultivar Chardonnay grapevines infected
by BN in Friuli Venezia Giulia (Italy). In contrast, apricot rarely recovers from ESFY. In this case direct recovery is not a
feasible solution. However, a recent study (Osler e¢ a/., 2014) showed that stably
recovered plants can become tolerant to ESFY and this character is transmissible to the

254

Management of phytoplasmaassociated diseases

progeny by grafting. As a consequence, it is possible to obtain plants hosting inducible
tolerance that can be grown in infected areas. The main advantage of this solution is the
possibility of obtaining plant genotypes of interest, which have been selected in the field
for tolerance/resistance to ESFY. The results gained from apricot and ESFY indicate
that recovery is expected to be directly or indirectly effective in apple and AP, pear and
PD and also grapevine and FD or BN. In the case of grapevine yellows, since recovery is
also from the agent and not only from symptoms, the realistic hope is to obtain plants
that are resistant to their phytoplasmas. In this way, the well-known limits of using
tolerant plants that carry the pathogen in infected areas would be avoided. Even if the understanding of recovery is much wider than in the past, it still remains
an underestimated way to control plant phytoplasma diseases. The results obtained
particularly with FD, BN and ESFY encourage future researches. References

Abstract

Phytoplasmas are insect-transmitted bacterial pathogens that induce dramatic changes in
planedevelopment, including proliferation of stems (witches’ brooms) and reversion of flowers
into leafy structures, Phytoplasma-infected plants are often more attractive and susceptible
to insect vectors. It was hypothesized that phytoplasma secrete virulence proteins that act
as effectors to interfere with plant pathways involved in the regulation of developmental
processes and defense to insects: a summary of main achievement in this field is reported. Key words: phytoplasmas, effectors, secreted proteins, gene regulation, disease. Introduction

Phytoplasmas are insect-transmitted bacterial pathogens that induce dramatic changes in
plant development, including proliferation of stems and reversion of flowers into leafy
structures, often resulting in sterile plants that only serve to help phytoplasmas reproduce
and propagate (zombie plants). As well, phytoplasma-infected plants are often more
attractive and susceptible to insect vectors. It was hypothesized that phytoplasma secrete
virulence proteins that act as effectors to interfere with plant pathways involved in the
regulation of developmental processes and defense to insects (Bai et a/., 2006; Hogenhout
and Loria, 2008; Hogenhout e¢ a/., 2008; Sugio et a/., 2011). In plants, phytoplasmas are
restricted to the phloem and the virulence effectors may unload from the phloem and
migrate to different plant tissues (Hogenhout and Loria, 2008; Sugio e¢ al., 2011). To test this hypothesis, the genome of aster yellows phytoplasma strain witches’ broom
(AY-WB) was sequenced to completion (Bai er al, 2006). Candidate virulence effectors
were identified by finding genes potentially encoding secreted proteins that have a
cleavable signal peptide at the N-terminus and absence of transmembrane domains
in the mature protein (part of the protein without signal peptide) (Bai et a/., 2009). To assess the functions of the AYWB candidate virulence effectors in plants, the
corresponding AY-WB genes were stably expressed in Arabidopsis plants under control
of the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and transgenic plants were
examined for changes in development, such as increased stem production, changes in
leaf shape and structure, altered flower development and increased susceptibility of
plants to insect vectors (MacLean et al., 2011; Sugio et al., 201 1a). A yeast two-hybrid
screen was conducted to find targets proteins in the plant host (Sugio ef a/., 201 1a). 261

Phytoplasmas and virulence effectors

The approximately 700 kb AY-WB genome consists of one chromosome and four plasmids
with about 700 predicted genes (Bai et a/., 2006). Of these genes, 56 were predicted to encode
secreted proteins; these were named secreted AY-WB protein (SAPs) and are candidate
virulence effectors (Bai et a/.,2009).SAP11 and three other SAPs contain a nuclear localization
signal (NLS); SAP11 was detected in nuclei of cells beyond the phloem in AY-WB-infected
plants suggesting that it is secreted by AY-WB and unloads from the phloem (Bai et a/., 2009). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants for about 50 SAPs were generated and those for SAPOS, SAPI1
and SAPS4 showed changes in development (MacLean ef al., 2011; Sugio ef al, 2011a). The
35S::SAPOS transgenic plants had changed leaf shapes, increased production of aerial rosettes
and altered flowering time, the 355::SAP1 plants had changed leaf shapes and increased stem
production and the 355:SAP5¢4 plants produced leafy flowers with indeterminate growth
(MacLean er al, 2011; Sugio et al, 2011a). A yeast two-hybrid screen of SAP11 against
an Arabidopsis. seedling library identified CINCINNATA (CIN)-tclated TEOSINTE
BRANCHED1I, CYCLOIDEA, PROLIFERATING CELL FACTORS (TCP) class
II transcription factors as targets of SAP11 (Sugio et al, 201 1a). SAP11 destabilizes these
transcription factors resulting in changes in leaf shape, increased production of stems,
downregulation of jasmonic acid production and greater susceptibility of plants to AYWB
leafhopper vectors (Sugio ef a/, 2011a). Thus, AY-WB phytoplasma produces virulence
effectors that are secreted and unload from the phloem to perturb specific plant transcription
factors leading to changes in plant development and increased susceptibility of plants to insect
vectors that together will help phytoplasmas reproduce and propagate. References

Abstract

Acholeplasmataceae comprises the genera Acholeplasma and the phytopathogenic bacteria of
the provisory taxon ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma: Several Acholeplasma species were reported as
commensals of animals, insects and plants. As data from genomes provide valuable information
for many subsequent studies, eight complete genome sequences from Acholeplasmataceae were
determined comprising strains from ‘Candidatus P. astetis, ‘Ca. P. australiense’ ‘Ca. P. mali’,
A. laidlawii, A. palmae and A. brassicae, Complete phytoplasma chromosomes vary in size
between 602-960 kb (G + C content: 21-28%) and are thereby separated from acholeplasma
chromosomes with a size of 1,497-1,878 kb (G + C content: 29-36%). Genome stability
and rare duplication events in the acholeplasmas also distinguish them from phytoplasmas. Corresponding to genome sizes, the number of protein encoding genes ranges from 481-
1,100 for and 1,380-1,690, respectively. The acholeplasma genomes encode a rich repertoire
of transport systems, a F,F, ATP synthase, components of the NADH oxidoreductase
complex and an extensive carbohydrate metabolism. In contrast, phytoplasmas are separated
by encoding effector proteins, in particular membrane proteins, a reduced number of
transport systems and an adapted comparable poorly equipped metabolism characterizing

 

the evolution of these parasites in their hosts. Key words: Acholeplasmataceae, genome, transport, metabolism, pathogen-host interaction. Introduction

Genome analysis, in particular the determination of complete genomes, is of high
impact for phytoplasma research. Genome derived data were used in a wide range of
studies including diagnosis, pathogen-host interactions, metabolism and phylogenetic

analyses. The provisory taxon ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ (IRPCM, 2004) and the genus
Acholeplasma are composing the family Acholeplasmataceae, which is part of the class
Mollicutes. Initial phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA suggested an early split of
the Acholeplasmataceae from other Mollicutes (Weisburg et al., 1989). In contrast to
many other Mollicutes, Acholeplasmataceae follow the usage of the bacterial genetic
code using UGA as a termination signal in general. Despite the close relationship of the
monophyletic taxon ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ (Lim and Sears, 1992; Toth et al., 1994) with the
genus Acholeplasma, differences in lifestyle are obvious. Phytoplasmas are characterized
as obligate parasites of the plant phloem and insects, and are associated as insect-borne
phytopathogenic bacteria to several hundred of plant diseases including many important
crops (Strauss, 2009). Acholeplasmas are generally characterized as saprophytes and not
as primary pathogens. Acholeplasma species were identified in many different habitats. Some species, for instance A. aidlawii, are ubiquitary distributed indicating a manifold
metabolic repertoire encoded by these commensals. Plant-derived isolates such as 4.
brassicae and A. palmae ftom Brassica oleracea vax. italica and Cocos nucifera (Tully et al.,
1994), respectively, highlight their origin by the scientific name, whereas other species
were identified on plant surfaces (e.g. A. laidlawii, A. axanthum and A. oculi) (Brown,
2011). Ic is remarkable that species of this genus were also identified in insects and that
some species even multiply in phytoplasma vectors (Eden-Green and Markham, 1987). However, interaction of acholeplasmas and insects remains unclear. Phytoplasmas
depend on their natural spread by insect vectors. Therefore, phytoplasmas have to deal
with different habitats such as the sieve tubes in the plant host and different environments
in the insect vector (Oshima e a/., 2011). The crossing of the gut barrier, colonization
of the haemolymph and salivary glands of the phloem-sucking insect vector are essential
steps in the infection cycle of phytoplasmas (Sugio ef al., 2011; 201 1a). In consequence,
phytoplasmas have to deal with changes in the composition of available metabolic
substrates but they are always surrounded as endocellular parasites by a nutrient-rich
environment (Kube e¢ a/., 2012). The availability of essential metabolites is thus not a
limiting factor compared to the situation present for many free-living bacteria. Genome condensation is evident in the evolution of both genera. Acholeplasma
genome sizes are ranging from about 1.2-2.1 Mb with a G + C content of 27-38%
whereas the smaller phytoplasma chromosomes range from 0.5 to 1.4 Mb and show a
decreased G + C content of 21-33% (Carle et al., 1995; Marcone et al., 1999; Neimark
and Kirkpatrick, 1993). Beside these general genome benchmarks and some shared
evolutionary processes, genomes of these genera are supposed to differ with respect to
pathogenicity and host interaction at least. General features of the Acholeplasmataceae genomes

The chromosome of ‘Ca. P. asteris’ strain OY-M (onion yellows-mild) (subgroup
16SrI-B) was the first fully sequenced phytoplasma genome (Oshima ef a/., 2004). 264

Genome analysis highlighted the reductive evolution taking part in phytoplasmas
encoding fewer metabolic functions compared to many other mycoplasmas such as the
absent pentose phosphate cycle and ATP-synthase subunits. Apart from the completely
encoded, ATP-providing glycolysis, Oshima and colleagues highlighted the high number
of incomplete pathways. Incomplete pathways and poor transporter environment were
considered to be compensated by the access to host-derived metabolites. Furthermore,
a remarkably high number of duplicated genes in the chromosome was observed and
interpreted to be responsible for an enlargement of the chromosome size compared to
the non-redundant gene content (Bai et a/., 2006; Oshima, et al., 2004; Tran-Nguyen
et al., 2008). The determination of the genome sequence of the closely-related aster
yellows witches’ broom phytoplasma strain AY-WB (subgroup 16SrI-A) showed the
largely conserved sequence synteny of both strains (Bai et a/., 2006). This analysis also
allowed the identification of complex transposons (so-called potential mobile units,
PMUs) with a strong impact on duplication of genomic regions. In combination with
the findings on the exchange of DNA between the encoded plasmids of strain AY-WB
and the on-going loss of genetic elements led to the hypothesis of genome instability and
rapid evolution of phytoplasmas. This hypothesis was underlined by the suggestion of
large phage-derived parts in the genomes (Wei et a/., 2008). Instability of phytoplasma
chromosomes is also characteristic for the two sequenced ‘Ca. P. australiense’ strains
(Tran-Nguyen et al, 2008; Andersen et al., 2013). Beside the previously described
elements, retrotransposons were identified. In summary, duplication and integration
events result in instability of the phytoplasma chromosomes (Kube eg a/., 2012). In
addition, an increased number of repeats also forces rearrangements. However, these
strains that belong to the major phylogenetic branch of phytoplasmas, share a general
genetic core of features, involved in housekeeping functions but also in transport and
metabolism. This image of phytoplasma genomes was modified by the analysis of the
genome sequence of ‘Ca. P. mali’ strain AT (Kube er a/., 2008). This genome, belonging
to a different major phylogenetic branch in the phytoplasmas, is organized in a linear
chromosome with long terminal inverted repeats. Duplication and integration events
are of limited impact for this genome resulting in a low number of rearrangements and
higher stability. Thereby, this chromosome sequence indicated that a genome reduction
without a high number of sequence repeats in phytoplasmas resulted in the low genome
size of 602 kb and a low G + C content of 21% (Table 1). In contrast to the phytoplasma genomes, which are reconstructed from metagenomic
data, acholeplasma genome projects derived from a DNA template obtained from an
axenic culture. The genome of A. laidlawii strain PG-8A was published in 2011 (Lazarev
et al., 2011). In 2013, the full sequences of the circular chromosomes of A. brassicae
strain 502 and A. palmae strain J233 were published (Kube ef al., 2014). A. laidlawii
encodes the smallest acholeplasma chromosome with 1.5 Mb while A. brassicae has a
size of 1.9 Mb. The fully sequenced circular chromsomes encode 1,380-1,690 proteins. The lowest G + C content was identified in the chromosome of A. palmae with 29%. 265

°CDS (Coding DNA Sequence) assignment is limited to protein coding genes

No plasmids were determined for these strains. All three chromosomes show a switch
of the coding strand preference in accordance to a bidirectional replication and a stable
cumulative GC-skew in contrast to the phytoplasma genomes (Figure 1). The most regular GC-skew for the phytoplasmas can be calculated from the condensed
genome of ‘Cz. P. mali, which also harbours a low number of PMUs (Kube et a/., 2008). Gene duplication is strongly limited in acholeplasmas, in contrast to the phytoplasmas. Exceptions include the unusual duplication of the rRNA operon in A. brassicae
resulting in four rRNA gene clusters, two of them encoding 165-235-58-5S-rRNA
genes. Duplicated genes include the single-stranded DNA binding protein (ssb), which
is encoded at least two times in phytoplasmas and two times in acholeplasmas (Kube
et al., 2014). Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced ssb protein highlighted a different
phylogenetic origin of this gene copies with one shared by Acholeplasma and ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ (ssb1). Only the copy showing same phylogenetic origin (ssb1), could be
confirmed as expressed in A. palmae, A. laidlawii, A. brassicae and ‘Ca. P. mali’ strain AT
all carrying two ssb genes. Besides having this independent shared evolutionary event
in common, the number of shared protein coding genes of both genera is below 300
(Lazarev er al., 2011; Kube et a/., 2014). Shared gene content is frequently organized in
units on the chromosomes indicating a common origin of both taxa, but independent
evolution (Kube ef a/., 2014). An indicator for this genomic feature is the low number

of paralogs in the acholeplasmas and the high number of paralogs in the phytoplamas
after an early split. Acholeplasmas posses a richer genetic repertoire of genes encoding proteins involved in
replication and repair, which is shared in parts for the phytoplasmas. Proteins involved
in cell division such as FtsZ and SepF are encoded on the acholeplasma genomes but
absent in the completely sequenced phytoplasma genomes. A brassicae A. palmae A. laidlawii

Chapter 6

Secretion and transport

Phytoplasmas interact with the host tissue via membrane proteins (Fabre e¢ a/., 2011;
Galetto et al.,2011; Neriyaetal.,2011; Boonrod et al.,2012) and the secretion of effector
proteins manipulating plant host and vector (Hoshi et a/., 2009; MacLean eg al., 2011;
Sugio e¢ al., 2011; 2011a). The effector protein SAP11 was identified in association
with PMU-like element supporting an impact of PMUs in host adaptation (Toruno
et al., 2010). However, genes encoding phytoplasma effectors were not identified in
the genomes of acholeplasmas (Kube er a/., 2014). Both taxa encode Sec-dependent
secretion pathway, which is completed by SecG in the acholeplasmas. Phytoplasmas
may encode, in addition a type IVB secretion system as indicated by the presence of the
IemE/DotG core component (Bai ef a/., 2006; Tran-Nguyen ef al., 2008; Saccardo et al.,
2012), which was not identified in the acholeplasmas (Kube et a/., 2014). Establishment of intracellular parasitism of the phytoplasmas resulted in a loss of
transport systems to a minimal core compared to the acholeplasmas (Kube ef a/., 2014). This core comprises ABC-transporters for sugars, spermidine/putrescine, methionine,
oligopeptides, amino acids, manganese/zinc and cobalt (Kube et al, 2012). This
repertoire also comprises a P-type ATPase, multidrug efflux pumps, a mechanosensitive
channel protein and a symporter for malate/citrate and sodium. Particularities of the
phytoplasmas are the uptake of cofactors such as manganese and substrates such as
malate. The limited amount of transport systems might be interpreted with respect to
the specialised metabolism of phytoplasmas. Carbohydrate metabolism

Genome analysis of ‘Cz. P. asteris’ strain OY-M revealed the Embden-Meyerhof-
Parnas pathway (glycolysis) as the central energy-yielding pathway in phytoplasmas
(Oshima et a/., 2004). The glycolysis is also part of a complex carbohydrate metabolism
of acholeplasmas in addition to the pentose phosphate cycle and the metabolism of
rhamnose, galacturonate, mannonate, galactose, glycogen and glycerophospholipids
(Lazarev etal,,2011;Kube eral, 2014). Both taxalack a conventional phosphotransferase
system (Oshima et al., 2011; Kube et al., 2014). Acholeplasmas encode core components,
which might be completed by not yet in detail characterized enzymes. There are no
hints for such starting points in phytoplasmas. It was speculated that the ancestors of
phytoplasmas encoded a sucrose phosphorylase enabling the usage of the major sugar
component of the phloem sap. Truncated genes were identified in ‘Cz. P. asteris’ strain
OY-M and ‘Ca. P. solani’ strains supporting such a scenario (Oshima et al, 20115
Mitrovic et a/., 2013). The option of an uncharacterized phosphorylase or the uptake of
a phosphorylated hexose from the environment was also discussed, taking into account
the intracellular lifestyle of phytoplasmas (Kube et a/., 2012). As already pointed out, glycolysis was suggested to be the major energy-yielding
pathway in phytoplasmas with respect to the poorly encoded carbohydrate metabolism. Genomes and their expression in COST FA0807

Coding of this pathway was identified in the closely related ‘Ca. P. asteris’ strains OY-M
and AY-WB, the strains of ‘Ca. P. australiense’ and the three acholeplasma genomes. In contrast, the genome of ‘Ca. P. mali’ lacks the energy-yielding part of glycolysis
(Kube er a/., 2008). An additional ATP-providing pathway was suggested, taking into
account particularities of the core genome of phytoplasmas (Kube e¢ a/., 2008; 2012). All sequenced phytoplasmas encode a symporter allowing the uptake of malate/citrate. Malate is suggested to be oxidatively decarboxylated by the malate dehydrogenase to
pyruvate in phytoplasmas. The encoded pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex
performs the oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA, which is converted by the
phosphotransacetylase to acetyl phosphate, latter is converted by the acetate kinase to
acetate and ATP. The key enzymes of this pathway are the symporter enabling the uptake
of malate or a similar substrate from the environment and the malate dehydrogenase. Both genes were not identified in the acholeplasmas (Kube et a/., 2014), highlighting a
significant difference in the metabolism of both taxa. The available genome information on Acholeplasmataceae and their encoded
metabolism is still limited. Several genome studies are in progress and will provide new
insights and a more complete picture of this bacterial family. References

Abstract

Strategies for in vitro expression in Escherichia coli of Imp immunodominant membrane
proteins from ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’ chrysanthemum yellows strain (CY) and
“flavescence dorée” (FD) phytoplasmas are reported. The entire imp genes of CY and FD
were cloned, sequenced and aligned with homologous sequences of phytoplasmas of different
phylogenetic groups. Partial CY and FD imp gene sequences devoid of the transmembrane
domains were cloned into the pQE32 and pRSetC vectors, but following IPTG induction,
both fusion Imp proteins were expressed at low levels. To increase protein expression of
the partial FD Imp, codon usage of the gene and accessibility of translation initiation were
modified according to that of E. coli. The new construct showed 80% nucleotide similarity
with the original FD imp gene, identical amino acid sequence and improved expression level. A second protein (about 28 kDa) was eluted under the same conditions as the putative partial
His-tagged ED Imp, but the latter protein was the only specifically recognized by an anti-
histidine antibody in Western blot. These results are the first indication that, at least for FD,
even in the absence of the troublesome transmembrane domain, an optimized codon usage is
useful to achieve i vitro expression of immunodominant protein. Key words: CY, FD, Imp, pRSetC, pQE32. Introduction

Three types of non homologous, highly abundant and immunodominant membrane
proteins (IDPs) have been identified in phytoplasmas: Amp, IdpA, and Imp (Kakizawa
et al., 2006). The three proteins are not all present in each phytoplasma genome: Imp is
found in sweet potato witches’ broom (Yu et a/., 1998), apple proliferation (Berg e¢ al.,
1999), European stone fruit yellows (Morton ef a/., 2003), pear decline (Morton et al.,
2003), peach yellow leaf roll (Morton et a/., 2003) and lime witches’ broom (Siampour
et al., 2013) phytoplasmas; IdpA is present in western X-disease (WX) and poinsettia
witches’ broom phytoplasmas (Blomquist e¢ a/., 2001; Neriya et a/., 2011), and Amp is
found in aster yellows (Barbara et a/., 2002), clover phyllody (Barbara et al., 2002), and
onion yellows (Kakizawa et al., 2004) phytoplasmas. Moreover, in several cases, genes
encoding two types of these proteins are present in phytoplasma genomes and one
of them may be predominantly expressed (Kakizawa et al., 2009; Neriya et al., 2011). Genomes and their expression in COST FA0807

Evolution under strong positive selection has been demonstrated for Amp and Imp
(Kakizawa e¢ al., 2006a; 2009; Siampour e¢ a/., 2013) supporting a possible role of both
proteins in determining phytoplasma fitness. Recently, in vitro studies have supported
the existence of interactions between phytoplasma IDPs and host proteins. In the case
of two strains of the ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris, specific in vitro interactions have
been demonstrated between phytoplasma Amp and several leafhopper vector proteins
(Suzuki er al., 2006; Galetto ef al., 2011). Phytoplasma IDPs also interact with plane
proteins, such as the case of ‘Ca. P. mali’ Imp and plant actin (Boonrod e¢ a/., 2012). The
expression of phytoplasma membrane genes in heterologous systems is a prerequisite for
successive studies. Here we report on strategies for the in vitro expression of Imp from
‘Ca. P. asteris’ chrysanthemum yellows strain and “flavescence dorée” phytoplasmas. Materials and methods

CY and FD imp gene identification and cloning into expression vectors

Primer pairs to amplify mp gene of CY (CYimp) and FD (FDimp), and to directionally
clone them into the expression vectors pRSetC (Invitrogen) and pQE32 (Qiagen) are
listed in Table 1. These primers were designed with Primer3 software (http://primer3. sourceforge.net/) based on dnaD and pyrG sequences of onion yellows phytoplasma
(AB469007, OY) for CYimp, and on most conserved regions of the ClustalW (http://
wwweebi.acuk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) alignment of diaD and pyrG sequences of
different phytoplasmas obtained from Kakizawa and co-workers (2009) for FDimp. According to restriction analyses of obtained CYimp and FDimp sequences (Nebcutter:
hetp://tools.neb.com/NEBcutter2/, and DNAMAN 4.02, Lynnon BioSoft), BamHI
(S’ end) and EcoRI (3’ end) were selected for the directional cloning into pRSetC
and BamHI (5’ end) and Hindlll (3’ end) for pQE32. All PCRs were conducted in
a standard master mix with 2 ng template DNA, 200 uM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl, and
1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Polymed) in a $1000” Thermal Cycler (BioRad). Amplicons (5 ul) were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel, stained with
ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. PCR products were purified by
GeneCleanTurbo kit (MP Biomedicals, LLC), ligated into pGEMT vector (Promega),
transformed into E. coli DH5a competent cells (Invitrogen), and screened by PCR with
universal vector primers M13F and M13R, following a routine protocol. Plasmid DNA
was extracted from recombinant colonies with the FastPlasmid Mini Kit (5 PRIME)
before sequencing (Bio-Fab Research s.rl.). Synthetic FD imp gene construction

A synthetic gene, including ribosome binding site, methionin starting codon,
N-terminus His tag and partial FDImp sequence devoid of transmembrane domain,
was designed starting from the obtained sequence of FDimp construct in pRSetC
vector. The synthetic gene was synthesized (Life Technologies) and cloned into pMA-T

plasmid (pMATModFDImp), and the plasmid was transformed into DHSa E. coli
competent cells. Table 1. List of primers used in this study. CY: chrysanthemum yellows phytoplasma, FD: “flavescence dorée”

In vitro expression and Western blot

The recombinant plasmids (pRSetC_CYImp_1 and _16, pQE32_CYImp_9 and_23;
pRSetC_FDImp_7 and _23, pQE32_FDImp_2 and _3, pMATModFDImp _1 and _2)
were purified with Fast Plasmid Minikit (5 PRIME) and transformed into competent
E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (pRSetC constructs and pMA-T construct) or M15 (pQE32,
constructs) with a standard protocol. pRSetC and pMA-T recombinant colonies were
grown on LB agar plates with ampicillin (50 pg/ml, Sigma) and chloramphenicol (35
ug/ml, Sigma), and pQE32 constructs were grown with ampicillin (50 ug/ml) and
kanamycin (25 ug/ml, Sigma). Single colonies were incubated over night into 1.5 ml
LB (pQE32 constructs) or SOB (pRSetC and pMA-T constructs) media containing
appropriate antibiotics at 27 or 37°C. Fresh dilutions (1:20, final 20 ml) of the over
night cultures in the presence or in absence of the correct antibiotic combination were
further incubated (at 27 or 37°C) to OD600 of 0.4-0.6 when 1 mM IPTG (Sigma) was
added to start induction of expression. Samples (1 ml) were taken just before IPTG
induction (TO) and at different times post inductions. Cells were harvested, lysed, and
purified according to the NiNTA Spin Columns (Qiagen) protocol under denaturing
conditions to isolate any tagged protein, irrespective of their solubility in different
cellular compartments. For SDS-PAGE analyses, 5 uL of 3x SDS-PAGE sample buffer

274

(Laemmli, 1970) was added to each sample aliquot (10 yl) and heat denatured (5 min);
proteins were loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gel, electrophoresed and stained with colloidal
Coomassie blue following a standard protocol. Protein molecular weight markers
(Unstained Broad Range Protein Standards, Bio-Rad) were also loaded. Western blot
experiments were conducted as previously described (Galetto et a/., 2008) with A416
polyclonal antiserum (reacting against the histidine tag of the fusion antigen) and a
secondary goat anti rabbit antibody HRP-conjugated (Sigma). Results and discussion

Molecular cloning of CY and FD imp genes

Primer pair Imp 1045 Fw/Imp 1893 Rv amplified a CY-specific fragment (849 bp) that
was cloned and sequenced (double coverage). It included 55 C-terminal bases of dnaD
gene, 126 bp intergenic region, the entire imp gene (468 bp), 79 bp intergenic region,
and 120 C-terminal bases of pyrG gene of CY (KJ402358). CY imp gene showed about
98% sequence identity with OY and PyWB corresponding sequences (onion yellows,
AB469007 and porcelain vine witches’ broom AB46901 1, respectively), while sequence
identities with other phytoplasmas were lower than 63% (Table 2). CY imp gene codeda
155 aminoacid protein, with a predicted MW of 17.8 kDa, and pl 9.47. A signal peptide
(C, Y, S, and D values of 0.394, 0.531, 0.993, and 0.672) and a predicted signal anchor
(probability: 0.958) were predicted as well as one transmembrane domain (amino acid
13 to 32) with a prediction of outside location for the remaining portion of the protein
(amino acids 33 to 155, Figures 1A, B, C). CY Imp protein showed more than 94%
sequence homology with corresponding proteins of OY and PvWB phytoplasmas (°C. P. asteris’ strains) and less than 17.5% with Imp protein of the remaining phytoplasma
strains (Table 2). Table 2. Similarity table for imp gene DNA (lower, left part) and amino acid (upper, right part) of chrysanthemum

FD-specific amplicons of the expected sizes, obtained with degenerate primer pair DNAd
Fw1/PyrG Rv1 (predicted amplicon size: 1027 bp), were cloned; sequencing (double
coverage) of three of the obtained plasmids confirmed that they were identical. The cloned
sequence (1,038 bp) included 254 C-terminal bases of dzaD gene, 124 bp intergenic
region, the entire mp gene (483 bp), 75 bp intergenic region, and 102 C-terminal bases of
pyrG gene of FD (KJ402359). FD imp gene showed less than 66% sequence identity with
the corresponding gene of all other phytoplasma tested (Table 2) and coded a 160 amino
acid protein, with a predicted MW of 18.1 kDa, and pl 9.60. A predicted signal anchor
(Signal anchor probability: 0.996) was detected together with one transmembrane domain
(amino acid positions 21 to 43) with a prediction of outside location for the remaining
portion of the protein (amino acids 44 to 160, Figures 1D, E, F). FD Imp protein showed
about 25% sequence homology with corresponding proteins of Korean potato witches’
broom phytoplasma and ‘Ca. P. oryzae’ (RYD strain), respectively and less than 20% with
Imp protein of the remaining phytoplasma strains (Table 2). Full length CY imp gene was cloned with non degenerate primers designed on the
closely related OY operon, while degenerated primers on most conserved regions from
the alignment of different phytoplasma species were required to obtain imp gene of FD. Indeed, sequence similarity at the gene level showed that FD imp was poorly conserved
among other phytoplasmas, especially compared with homologous genes of other ‘Ca. P asteris’ strains, and it clustered with group III phytoplasmas (16SrIII) according to
Kakizawa and co-workers (2009). On the contrary, CY imp was confirmed to be closely
related to that of ‘Cz. P asteris’ group and showed low identity with imp genes of 16SrX1
group members. Similarity of Imp proteins within the ‘Ca. P. asteris’ was higher than
94%, while it decreased to less than 20% with the homologous amino acid sequences
of other ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ species, thus confirming the high variability of this protein
among phytoplasmas and the evolutionary pressure to which it is subjected (Kakizawa
et al., 2009; Siampour et al., 2013), a clue of its role in interactions with hosts, as already
shown for Amp of OY (Kakizawa et al., 2006a). >CY_Imp. >FD_Imp

Heterologous expression of CY and FD Imp proteins

Primers were designed to clone partial CY and FD imp gene sequences devoid of the
transmembrane domains and few of the following amino acids into the pQE32 and
pRSetC vectors. Sequencing of two transformed plasmids for each target showed
identical sequences and in silico translation indicated expected MWS of 17.9 and 14.2
kDa (156 and 123 amino acids, for pRSetC_CYImp and pQE32_CY Imp, respectively)
and 16.7 and 13.4 kDa (146 and 117 amino acids, pRSetC_FDImp and pQE32_
FDImp, respectively) for the four partial fusion Imp proteins. The pRSetC encoded
fusion proteins contained the 120 (CYP) and 110 (FDP) C-terminal Imp aminoacids
of each phytoplasma, while the pQE32 constructs expressed the C-terminal 111 amino
acids for CYP Imp and 103 amino acids for FDP Imp. The transformed pRSetC and pQE32 plasmids with partial CY and FD imp genes were
transformed into BL21 and M15 E. coli host cell strains, respectively. Following IPTG
induction, both fusion Imp proteins were expressed, although at low levels, irrespective
of the expression vector used (data not shown). To increase protein expression of the partial FD Imp in E. coli, the codon usage of the
gene and accessibility of translation initiation were modified and the pMATModFDImp
construct was produced. Alignment of both gene and protein sequences of pRSetC_
FDImp and pMATModFDImp showed that, despite the low (80%) identity at the
nucleotide level, the predicted primary sequences of the FD Imp partial fusion proteins
were identical (Figure 2). Following IPTG induction of the pMATModEDImp
transformed clone, a partial FD Imp fusion protein (MW: 16.7 kDa, 146 amino acids)
was produced | h after IPTG induction and the expression increased up to 4 h post
induction. The partial FD fusion Imp was then purified by binding to NiNTA beads. 277

Chapter 6

Gel electrophoresis of the different elution phases, showed that a second protein (about
28 kDa) was eluted under the same conditions as the putative partial FD fusion Imp
(about 17 kDa) (Figure 3A), although only the latter protein reacted specifically with
the anti histidine (His) antibody in Western blot, therefore confirming the expected
presence of the His tag, while the 28 kDa protein did not (Figure 3B). Jn vitro expression
of full length Imp from several phytoplasmas has been reported (Yu ef al., 1998; Berg et
al., 1999; Neriya et al., 2011) and, in some cases removal of the transmembrane domain
from the coding sequence was the key to obtain enough fusion antigen for the successive
production of Imp-specific antibodies (Kakizawa et al., 2009). It is known that LWB
(lime witches’ broom) and AIf WB (alfalfa witches’ broom) (16SrII group) partial Imp
proteins can be expressed to high concentration in E. coli (Siampour ef al., 2013), and
these genes have low sequence identity/similarity with corresponding genes/proteins
of CY and FD (this study). Moreover, expression of a recombinant phage library of the
sweet potato witches’ broom phytoplasma (SPWB, 16SrII group) indicated that SPWB
imp gene expression was independent of the E. coli promoter (Yu ef a/., 1998). On
the other hand, pMATModFDImp, which was designed to improve the codon usage
and accessibility of translation initiation for expression in E. coli, but showed identical
amino acid sequence as FD Imp, was expressed at a much higher level compared to the
original FD izmp gene present in pRSetCFDImp. Optimization of the codon usage for
expression in E. coli seems a most promising strategy to improve yield of recalcitrant
recombinant phytoplasma membrane proteins. M12 345678 91112 1314

Abstract

To study antagonistic interactions of ‘Candidarus Phytoplasma mali’ strains, Catharanthus
voseus and Nicotiana occidentalis were inoculated with mild strains 1/93Vin and 1/93Tab
respectively as suppressors and with two aggressive strains as challengers. Inoculation of
the suppressors was carried out in either the cross protection modus prior to grafting of the
challengers or by co-inoculating suppressors and challengers. In the cross protection trials
with C. rosews, suppressor 1/93Vin was present in all root and randomly collected stem
samples over the entire observation period. In contrast, the challengers were never detected in
such stem samples and rarely in the roots. Following simultaneous inoculation, the suppressor
colonized all stem and root regions whereas detection of challenger AT steadily decreased. However, this strain remained detectable in up to 13% and 27% of stem and root samples,
respectively, The cross protection trials with N. occidentalis yielded results similar to that
with C. roseus. Examination of differently infected apple trees indicated that suppression of
severe strains also occurs in apple. Phylogenetic analysis using a variable fragment of AAA+
ATPase gene AP460 of ‘Ca. P. mali’ revealed that 1/93Vin and 1/93Tab together with several
mild strains from apple, cluster distantly from obviously nonsuppressive strains that were
predominantly highly virulent. Key words: ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali, apple proliferation, suppression, disease
development, phylogenetic clustering. Introduction

The wall-less bacterium ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’is the agent of apple proliferation
(AP), one of the most important phytoplasma diseases in Europe. This psyllid-
transmitted pathogen induces a range of specific and nonspecific symptoms, associated
with reduced vigor and size and value of the crop. Previous work showed that symptom
expression depends on the virulence of the infecting strain(s). Long-term observations
showed that virulence of ‘Cz. P. mali’ accessions ranged from being avirulent or mildly
virulent to strongly virulent (Seemiiller and Schneider, 2007). However, symptom
expression is often subject to fluctuation. In particular, the formation of the most
characteristic witches’ broom symptom is often typical for newly diseased trees and can
be observed in the first few years of disease. Then, trees may recover and show no or only
mild symptoms for shorter or longer periods, after which severe symptoms may reappear

280

Genomes and their expression in COST FA0807

(Carraro et al., 2004; Seemiiller ef a/., 1984; 2010). From recent work, there is evidence
that such fluctuations can be attributed to multiple infections of apple trees by distinct
strains of ‘Ca. P. mali. Such infections are common and are usually composed of strains
that greatly differ in virulence. Obviously due to antagonistic interactions between mild
and severe strains, shifts in the population may occur that result in increased or, more
often, reduced virulence of the infecting phytoplasmas (Seemiiller et a/., 2010; 2011). The multiple-strain accession 1/93 is an example for such variations. Trees infected
by this source were largely symptomless for many years. Following transmission to
periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) and Nicotiana occidentalis, ewo distinctly different
strains, referred to as 1/93Vin and 1/93Tab, respectively, were identified by single-
strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence analysis of a variable
fragment of AAA+ A/fIB protease gene ATP464. The same strains were identified in the
largely symptomless donor tree of accession 1/93, jointly or separately. Each of the two
strains identified in apple, and the experimental hosts showed distinct SSCP profiles
and clustered with other mild strains in phylogenetic analysis. However, following
graft transmission of accession 1/93 from a field-grown tree to a clonal rootstock and
growing the recipient trees in an unheated greenhouse, one of several inoculated trees
developed witches’ broom symptoms. Using SSCP and sequence typing, a third strain
was identified in the diseased tree that clustered with severe strains of other accessions
in phylogenetic analysis. Further investigations revealed that this strain also occurred
in low numbers in the roots of the symptomless donor tree, together with the two
predominant mild strains (Seemiiller et a/., 2010; 2011). In this contribution, further indication of antagonistic interaction between AP
phytoplasma strains, mainly on the suppressive action of the largely avirulent periwinkle-
and tobacco-maintained strains 1/93Vin and 1/93Tab on aggressive strains is reported. The occurrence of suppressive actions of AP phytoplasma strains in infected apple
trees was inferred by linking SSCP and nucleotide sequence data of the AAA+ ATPase
gene AP460 with the disease history of the trees and the symptoms shown at sampling. The ATPase AP460 gene sequence proved to be suitable to distinguish established
and supposed suppressive and nonsuppressive strains. In addition, the nucleotide and
deduced amino acid sequences of this gene and those of hf1B protease ATP464 enable
distinction of largely avirulent and aggressive AP phytoplasma strains (Seemiiller e¢ a/.,
201 1a; 2013). Suppressive action in periwinkle

Six to eight month-old cutting-propagated periwinkle plants were graft-inoculated
at three evenly distributed sites with the mild strain 1/93Vin used as suppressor and,
at three other evenly distributed sites, with either aggressive strains AT or AP15 used
as challengers. In the three trials carried out, inoculation of suppressor 1/93Vin was
carried out 2.5 to 4 month prior to the inoculation of challengers (“cross protection

Chapter 6

modus”) or strains 1/93Vin and AT were co-inoculated at the time challenger AT was
grafted to pre-inoculated plants. In each trial, three healthy controls and three singly
inoculated plants were included. Following the second inoculation term, the plants were
observed for symptom development over 33 to 43 month. The presence of suppressors
and challengers was monitored employing multiplex real-time PCR with strain-specific
‘TaqMan probes as described (Schneider er a/., 2014). Approximately 600 samples from
45 plants were examined. The symptoms of the inoculated control plants differed considerably. Suppressor
1/93Vin induced only mild symptoms. Four months postinoculation (p.i. ), infected
plants showed mild foliar yellowing, nearly normal-sized and only weakly undulated
leaves, and flowers slightly smaller than normal. At termination of the trials, the plants
did not differ from healthy controls. In contrast, strains AT and AP15 caused much
more pronounced symptoms by inducing earlier and more severe yellowing symptoms,
strongly undulated and distinctly smaller leaves, and much smaller flowers than
1/93Vin. Flowering of AT- and AP15-inoculated plants ceased 8 to 10 months p.i. At
the end of the observation periods, all AT- and AP 15-inoculated plants were either dead
or declining. Periwinkle plants pre-inoculated with strain 1/93Vin and challenged with strains
AT or APIS developed predominantly the mild symptoms of strain 1/93Vin alone. Only the growth developed from the challenger scions, and leaves of the grafted shoot
below the grafting site showed the typical symptoms induced by strains AT and AP15. These symptoms persisted for about 10 months and then slowly disappeared. Sixteen
months after of the secondary inoculation, no AT- or AP15-specific symptoms could be
observed. Flowering of the cross protected plants remained until the end of observation
periods as described for the plants inoculated with 1/93Vin alone. In addition, the
overall symptomatology was similar. The symptoms of the plants co-inoculated with
the suppressor and the challengers differed from that of cross-protected plants: foliar
AT symptoms, mainly on the growth of the challenger scions persisted for up to two
years. At the end of the observation periods, no differences between healthy controls,
inoculated 1/93Vin controls, cross-protected and co-inoculated plants were observed. There was no decline of cross-protected or co-inoculated plants. In the three trials carried out, all randomly collected shoot samples taken from pre-
inoculated plants tested positive for suppressor 1/93Vin over the entire monitoring
period, independently of the first sampling date ranging from 3.5 to 8 months after the
second inoculation. In contrast, challenger strains AT and AP15 were never detected
in shoot samples from such plants. Similarly, strain 1/93Vin was from the beginning of
sampling detected in all root samples of cross-protected plants, whereas strain AT was
not or rarely detected in root samples. The figures obtained following co-inoculation
differed significantly from those of cross-protected plants. At the first sampling dates,
detection frequency in stem samples was similar for suppressor and challenger. Then,
detection rate of 1/93Vin steadily increased, reaching 100% 12 to 27 months p.i. of the

282

challenger. In contrast, detection of the challenger successively decreased. However, up
to 13% of the samples remained strain AT-positive at the end of the trials. In the roots of
co-inoculated plants, suppressor and challenger were at first detected in all samples. This
was true for the suppressor until the end of the observation period whereas detection of
the challengers decreased to 20-27%. An example of the results obtained in one of the
trials is shown in Figure 1. Detection

Suppressive action in Nicotiana occidentalis

Two trials were carried out in which plants grown from seeds were inoculated in the
cross protection modus. In each trial, seven eight-week-old plants were inoculated with
suppresser 1/93Tab and 3 or 6 weeks later with challenger strain AT. Sampling started
4 or 6 weeks after challenging, and was repeated three times in the following three
months. The presence of suppressor and challenger was monitored employing multiplex
real-time PCR with strain-specific TaqMan probes as described (Schneider e¢ a/., 2014). Suppressor 1/93Tab, which proved to be largely avirulent in apple trees (Seemiiller
et al., 2013), induced distinct symptoms consisting of foliar yellowing associated
with enlargement and browning of veins. With the development of foliar symptoms,

flower size decreased and flowering ceased 2 to 3 month p.i. The plants declined 4 to
5 months p.i. of the challenger. Symptomatology was similar on plants pre-inoculated
with 1/93Tab and challenged with strain AT. However, plants inoculated with strain
AT alone showed more pronounced symptoms, leading to decline 1 month earlier than
plants cross-protected with 1/93Tab. In both cross protection experiments phytoplasma detection was similar to that of the
cross protection trials with periwinkle. In both N. occidentalis trials, suppressor 1/93Tab
was detected in all randomly collected stem samples whereas challenger AT was never
detected. In addition, the suppressor was detected in all root samples collected at the
end of the experiment whereas the tests were negative for the challenger. In contrast,
the challenger was detected in the new growth of the AT inoculated scion, and in lateral
shoots below the AT grafting side. However, there were distinct differences between the
two trials, due to the different incubation period of the suppressor of 3 versus 6 weeks
prior to challenge inoculation. These differences are evident by a much higher detection
rate of the suppressor, and a much lower detection rate of the challenger after the longer
incubation period of suppressor. However, despite these differences, the suppressor
was detected in all samples by the end of the experiments, whereas detection of the
challenger decreased to zero in both trials. Molecular features of suppression and evidence of suppression in apple

To identify molecular features related to suppression, SSCP analysis ofa variable cloned
fragment of gene AP460 of approximately 455 bp in length was used as described
(Schneider et al, 2014). This approach revealed that suppressive strains 1/93Vin and
1/93'Tab show similar profiles consisting in one group of bands. This profile is different
from those of aggressive, periwinkle- and N, occidentalis-maintained challenger strains
AT and AP1S5 that are composed of two groups of bands. Both types of profiles were
identified in cloned PCR fragments of gene AP460 in root samples from multiple-strain
accession 1/93 maintained in apple consisting of mild and severe strains (Figure 2). Strain 1/93Vin Strain AT Strain 1/93 from apple

In order to relate the presence of these markers to the symptomatology of infected apple
trees, 12 other trees with known disease history were examined. This analysis revealed
a close correlation between the gene AP460 markers, and the symptoms shown at
sampling. In accessions inducing severe symptoms, only cloned fragments showing the
profile of nonsuppressive strains were identified, whereas in most symptomless trees only
suppression-associated profiles were observed. Both types of fragments were detected in
trees exhibiting moderate symptoms. An exception of these patterns was shown by the
phytoplasma type present in a nonsymptomatic tree that exhibited the profile of severe
strains. This observation seems to indicate that not all mild strains are suppressive, and
that the suppression-associated profiles are not markers for virulence like sequences in
other regions of gene AP460 and other AAA+ protein genes. It thus appears that both
strain virulence and suppressive action of strains determine disease development. Based on the SSCP profiles, gene AP460 inserts of recombinant plasmids were sequenced
and the variable, suppression-relevant 319- to 322-bp 5’ fragments used in phylogenetic
analysis. Construction of the phylogram resulted in two homogenous major branches
represented by fragments of suppressive strains 1/93Vin and 1/93Tab and by the
putatively nonsuppressive strains AT and AP15, respectively. The suppression-associated
sequences of mild strains including those of accession 1/93 from apple, periwinkle and
N. occidentalis, and several other accessions from apple were identical or nearly identical
and clustered in one major branch (Schneider et a/., 2014). cussion

In previous work, we were able to distinguish and specifically amplify both mild and
severe strains of the AP phytoplasma based on sequences of several AAA+ ATPase
and AfIB protein genes. Furthermore, we could show that multiple strain infections
are common and that they usually consist of mild and severe strains. Under still poorly
understood circumstances, shifts in the composition of the populations may occur. Because symptom expression depends on the prevailing strain(s), such changes determine
disease appearance and severity, and may result in recovery or in reappearance of severe
symptoms. As observed in this work with accession 1/93, avirulent and mild strains
predominate in the roots of recovered trees whereas severe strains persist latently only in
low numbers (Seemiiller er a/., 2010; 2011). Due to the observations on accession 1/93,
a suppressive action of the mild strains was taken into consideration. The inoculation
experiments with the experimental hosts periwinkle and N. occidentalis reported here
confirmed this assumption. The antagonistic action of suppressors 1/93Vin and
1/93Tab was most pronounced in the trials with periwinkle and N. occidentalis carried
out in the cross protection modus, In these experiments, the suppressor was identified in
all randomly collected stems and in all root samples over the entire observation period. In contrast, the challengers were not detected in such stems and rarely in the roots. Following simultaneous inoculation of periwinkle, the suppressor successively colonized

all stem and root regions whereas detection of challenger AT decreased. However, this
strain usually remained detectable in up to 13% of the stem samples and 27% of the root
samples. This data indicate that strains 1/93Vin and 1/93Tab are powerful suppressors
that either eliminates the challengers or reduces their population below the detection
level and to a concentration that did not markedly affect the plants. These results with
the experimental host periwinkle and N. occidentalis together with the data obtained
with apple suggest that suppressive strains are involved in the widespread recovery
phenomenon. References
