Abstract

Phytoplasmas are serious pathogens of several important plants throughout the world. Apricot phytoplasma disease (“Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum”) was first reported from France in
Europe, in 1924 from. In 1992, the disease was identified in Hungary. Our goals were to diagnose the
occurrence of Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum on stone fruits in North-Hungarian growing areas by
visual diagnostics and to confirm data by laboratory PCR-based examinations. Plant samples were
tested in laboratory trials, and the presence of phytoplasma were confirmed from apricot, peach,
cherry, sour cherry and wild plum Field investigation were also done in a Western-Romanian apricot
plantation, and the presence of phytoplasma disease was also identified. It was the first time that
symptoms of Ca. Phytoplama prunorum had been observed in the western part of Romania. On the
basis of these observations it seems evident that the notable losses caused by Ca. Phytoplasma
prunorum is a new plant hygiene problem for fruit growers to manage, especially for apricot
producers in Hungary and other Cental-European countries as well. Key words: Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum, European stone fruit yellows pytoplasma, ESFY, Ca. Phytoplasma vitis, stone fruits, apricot, peach. INTRODUCTION

Phytoplasmas are serious pathogens of several important plants
throughout the world, causing a wide variety of symptoms that range from
mild yellowing to the death of infected plants. Stolbur disease of potato and
tomato (Candidatus Phytoplasma solani) is one of the most common plant
disease caused by phytoplasmas. Apple and pear have also phytoplasma
originated diseases (Ca. Phytoplasma mali, Ca. Phytoplasma pyri), but
grape and maize are also endangered by phytoplasmas. Coconut, sugarcane,
rice, sandal wood in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world also have
serious diseases caused by phytoplasmas. Phytoplasma diseases have
increasing importance for fruit growers. These agents reside in the phloem
tissues of the plants, and they require a vector to be transmitted from plant
to plant, and this normally takes the form of sap sucking insects such as leaf
hoppers in which they are also able to replicate. Phytoplasmas cannot be
transmitted mechanically. Until 1967, plant diseases known as ,,yellows diseases” were thought
to be caused by viruses. In 1967, Japanese researchers (Doi Y. et al., 1967)
found microorganism by electron microscope in yellows diseased plants. This new class of plant disease agents was named a “mycoplasma-like
organism” (Welliver, 1999). In 1992, characterization of the organisms

281

associated with yellows diseases had progressed to a point where it became
clear they were unique and should be given their own name:
PHYTOPLASMA (Gundersen et al., 1994). Apricot phytoplasma disease was reported first in Europe in 1924, in
France (Chabrolin, 1924). ,,Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum (Seemiiller,
Schneider, 2004) [(syn: European Stone Fruit Yellows Phytoplasma; ESFY
(K6vics, 2009)] is one of the most important diseases of apricot in Hungary. In Hungary and in the neighbouring Central-European countries it is a
relatively new and serious pathogen for the apricot cultivation. The disease
was observed first on apricot in Hungary in 1992 (Siile, unpublished). Later
on occurrence of the ESFY was confirmed by molecular biological
examinations in Hungary (Viczian et al., 1997; Siile et al., 1997). After that,
similar symptoms were also observed on other stone fruits (Mergenthaler E.,
2004). Occurrence of phytoplasma disease was observed in peach (Németh
et al., 2001), Prunus serrulata (Lorenz K. H. et al., 1994), Prunus mahaleb
cv. Cemany (Varga et al., 2001) and Prunus spinosa (Jarausch et al., 2000)
as well. The disease on cherry was reported in France as “Molieres-disease”,
but several experts thought that cherry is resistant to phytoplasma infection
(Jarausch W. et al., 2000). European plums have been determined to be
tolerant to Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum, whereas Japanese plums are highly
susceptible (Mona G. et al, 2008). The psyllid Cacopsylla pruni Scopoli was
described as the main vector of Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum. Another importand phytoplasma disease is the Flavescence Dorée
Phytoplasma on grape. It was first observed in France in 1949. Then in a
few decades the disease appeared in many countries of southern Europe,
such as Croatia, Austria and Slovenia. The disease agent in the new
nomenclature called Candidatus Phytoplasma vitis. The pathogen is on the
list of quarantine pests in the European Union. The introduction and
dissemination of the pathogen is prohibited. The disease was identified in
Hungary in Zala county in the August of this year (Kriston et al., 2013). Vector of the disease is the Scaphoides titanus, which was found in 2006 in
Hungary. Since then it spread throughout the country. MATERIAL AND METHOD

Objectives of our work were to examine stone fruit plantations in the
Carpathian-Basin, and to identify infections of Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum. Field examinations were done on several stone fruit gardens in
Borsod-Abauj-Zemplén county (on Géne Apricot Growing Area), in Hajdu-
Bihar county (Hajdidorog) and in West-Romania, near Oradea city
(Biharpiisp6ki) between 2009-2012 (12 apricot cultivars, 1 peach
population, 4 sour cherry and | cherry plantation). Our first goal was to
visually identify Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum infection on stone fruits

282

(especially on apricot) on the examined Northern-Hungarian an Romanian
growing areas. During the field examinations infection ratio (I%) and infection index
(li) [according to a classification system (Table 1)] were calculated in the
various stone fruit plantations based on the visible symptoms of the disease
caused by Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum. The classification system contains 5
infection degrees, and the symptoms are getting more and more serious
from the I. degree towards the V. degree. Infection degrees were classified
on the basis of the following symptoms:
-on leaves: yellow colour change and rolling of leaves to its abaxial surface,
-on branches: general yellowing or ,,scalding-like” drying,
-in the trunk: having striped the bark of tree, orange or light brown colour
change is visible in the phloem
-on trees: general yellowing on several branches or general drying similar to
the destruction of the apricot die-back (apoplexy) but there is no secretion
of resin; withered, dead or felled tree,
-at the plantation: infections and destruction of trees starting in a circular
direction around the infected tree. Usually 100 trees were examined on a site (except the smaller fruit
gardens). 10 fruit trees of a circle were randomly selected for examination
from 10 circles, that is 100 trees in total. Table 1
Scale of infection index (Fi) classification system (Tarcali, Kévics , 2009)
Infection degrees Symptoms
I Healthy tree
Il Symptoms on leaves, on 1 branch
Tl General yellowing or drying, symptoms on several branches
IV 1 dead branch
Vv Dead or felled tree

 

 

 

 

Plant samples were collected from the supposedly infected trees,
based on the visible symptoms (living leaves, pieces of branches and pieces
of roots) by a sharp sampling knife for further laboratory examinations. The
identification of phytoplasma is only possible from living plant parts. Identification is not possible from dead plant samples because of the life of
the pathogen twit to the living phloem of the plant (Mergenthaler, 2004). In the laboratory, molecular biological examinations were applied
(PCR) to identify first the phytoplasma, and then the kind of the
phytoplasma. The primers, sequences and programs which were applied on
the PCR examination in order to identify the phytoplasma are shown in the
Table 2. 283

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Results of the field examinations
Field examinations on the research of Ca Phytoplasma prunorum was
egun on 02 October, 2009 in the village of Bekecs (near Szerencs city). Four apricot plantations, one peach, one cherry, and three sour cherry
plantations were examined on that year. The visual experience was the view
of a very depressing situation, the apricot plantations were heavily
destructed by phytoplasma disease, and a great number of apricot trees were
dead or felled in the fruit gardens. Yellowing and rolling leaves on the
apricot branches and several drying branches were found on the apricot
trees. A similar situation was visible on peach, and the same was
experienced on cherry and sour cherry trees. Very serious destruction of
85% was experienced in the Bekecs-Téglaszin apricot garden on 3 hectares. It was the most heavily infested and destructed apricot population among
the examined spots. Very serious infection ratio was measured; out of the
one hundred examined trees as many as, 85 were infected, and according to
the classification system (Table 1) 65 were dead or felled, as it is visible in
the column V. of Table 3, showing the degree of infection. Other stone fruit
kinds were also examined during the field investigations. A more moderate
infection was experienced in a 12-13-year-old peach cultivar where
phytoplasma infection with a rate of 21% was experienced. The destruction
rate on peach was not so high as it was on apricot, but the problem with Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum seemed to be evident there. Three sour cherry and
one cherry plantations were examined as well. Destruction (of various rates)
caused by phytoplasma were found. On the first examined sour cherry
plantation the infection rate was very high (62%) and there were several
withered or felled trees. It was easily observable that sour cherry and cherry
are also endangered by Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum infection. A

284

comparatively new, only 4-year-old apricot plantation was examined first. Most trees were healthy, but there were a few trees (2%) infected by Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum (Table 3). According to the description by Siile et al. (2003), on the apricot trees the first symptoms of the pathogen can be
observed from the age of 3 or 4, and this thesis was justified in the visited
apricot garden. The cultivars (cv.) of apricot grown on the plantations were
the following ones: Ceglédi Orids (Cegléd Giant), Ceglédi Arany (Cegléd
Gold) and Magyar Kajszi (Hungarian Apricot). The cultivar Cegléd (new
local varieties in Hungary) are more susceptible to phytoplasma disease than
the old one, the Hungarian Apricot. In 2010, further field research work were done in 6 fruit gardens in
Borsod-Abauj-Zemplén County, and | apricot plantation was visited and
examined in West-Romania, in the village of Biharpiisp6ki, near the city of
Oradea. Very high infection rates were measured in Biikkaranyos on 2
apricot gardens (1%: 77-84) and | sour cherry plantation (I%: 59) as it is
shown in Table 3. No high infection rates were measured in the examined
Romanian apricot garden, but the presence of apricot phytoplasma disease
was evident, and it was the first time that Ca Phytoplama prunorum had
been identified in the western part of Romania. In 2011, field investigations were done repeated in Bekecs area, and in
Biharpiispéki. The infection data were higher on every examined plots
compared to the data of the previous years. A new field investigation spot, a
sour cherry plantation in Hajdidorog (Hajdu-Bihar County) was also
examined. According to warnings of local growers there were several
suspicious sour cherry trees, but there were not found any phytoplasma
infected trees on our field investigation. According to the results of the field experiences and the data of
infection in the last 3 years, we can conclude on the plant health conditions
of stone fruit plantations on the examined areas are rather bad. It was
confirmed on apricot, peach and sour cherry in Bekecs area by the results of
field investigations this year (illustrated by the photos on Figure 1-3)
Besides, the data of the latest field examinations show that phytoplasma
infection rate on peach (Bekecs-Majos plantation) has been increased
significantly, as we can see the date of 22 September investigation spot (I%:
19) and 27 September investigation spot (1%: 38) in the Table 3. The latest
data of field examination in Biharpiispéki (Romania) shows that infection of
phytoplasma disease on apricot also increased (illustrated by photo on
Figure 4). 285

Results of the laboratory examinations

As many as 44 plant samples were collected on the field areas, which
were examined in laboratory by PCR in the last 4 years (2009-2012). The
presence of "Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum" was detected on 24 examined
samples (Table 4). Phytoplasma infection was detected from the collected
plant samples on all examined stone fruit varieties (apricot, peach, cherry,
sour cherry, wild plum) respectively. The results of phytoplasma
identifications are shown on Figure 5 and 6. The presence of the pathogen
without any typical symptoms in tolerant wild plum was also detected, and
it is obvious that wild plum may have an important part in the spreading of
the pathogen. Plant samples were also collected and examined in 2012 on the
examined plots (Bekecs - apricot, peach, sour cherry, Biharpiisp6ki —
apricot). 286

CONCLUSIONS

The disease caused by Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum is continously
increasing and as a relatively new problem for fruit growers in Hungary, it
seriously threatens the most important Hungarian apricot cultivations, and
other stone fruits areas. After the experiences of the field examinations it
was confirmed by the laboratory results that Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum is a
rather serious danger for stone fruits in Hungary and Central-Europe. Our experiences resulting from our investigation show that we have to
pay more attention to the increasing phytoplasma problem in stone fruits,
and have to develop new and effective management strategies. REFERENCES
