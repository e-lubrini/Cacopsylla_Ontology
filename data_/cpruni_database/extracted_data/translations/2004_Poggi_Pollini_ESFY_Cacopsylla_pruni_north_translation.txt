Abstract

European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) has been reported in Italy with
increasing frequency in peach orchards in the provinces of Forli-Cesena, Ravenna,
Rimini and Verona. The discovery of the natural vector of ESFY phytoplasma, the
psyllid Cacopsylla pruni, prompted us to investigate the presence of psyllids infected
by ESFYP, as well as other potential vectors and alternative hosts, in various
orchards in these provinces. The molecular diagnostic method used (PCR-ELISA)
made it possible to detect several C. pruni psyllids infected by ESFYP in this area,
but no important secondary vectors were found in the peach orchards. Molecular
tests were also made on wild plants surrounding the orchards, leading to ESFYP
identification in wild Prunus alone. INTRODUCTION

In Europe, several syndromes caused by European Stone Fruit Yellow
Phytoplasma (ESFYP), a member of the Apple Proliferation (AP) group (Lee et al, 1998;
Seemiiller et al., 1998) have been described in stone fruit species. This pathogen can be
spread naturally by the psyllid Cacopsylla pruni Scopoli (Carraro et al., 2001). Prior to 1995, ESFYP was only sporadically reported in peach tree orchards, but
recent studies have indicated a spreading of this syndrome in Northern Italy. In the
orchards inspected, 1-4% of trees were affected, most of which grafted on cv. G.F. 677
(Poggi Pollini et al., 2001a). This article reports further investigation of ESFYP epidemiology to evaluate the
possible existence of alternative hosts or other potential vectors. MATERIALS AND METHODS

In the two year period 2000-2002, to obtain greater information about the
spreading of ESFYP in peach orchards, leafhoppers and psyllids were captured in the
Forli-Cesena, Ravenna, Rimini and Verona provinces. The insects were captured using
the “frappage” method or chromotropic traps placed on cultivated and wild stone fruit
trees (Table 1), and, during the winter, on conifers and other wild plants surrounding the
areas where an increase had been noted in the disease in recent years (Table 2). Tests were also made on other wild rosaceous plants (Prunus cerasifera, P.
mahaleb, P. spinosa, Rosa canina, Rubus fruticosus), generally asymptomatic or showing
off-season growth in winter, in the vicinity of the affected orchards. Several common wild
plants (Celtis australis, Cornus sanguinea, Corylus avellana, Cupressus leylandii,

Fraxinus excelsior, Laurus nobilis) were also analysed for the presence of ESFYP or
other phytoplasmas. Previous reports indicated that some were ESFYP-hosts (Jarausch et
al., 2001a). Out of 20 C. australis trees, 8 showed leaf chlorosis and 8 leaf roll. All the C.
sanguinea shrubs exhibited leaf reddening; the other species were symptomless. Total DNA was extracted from groups of insects (2-5), after classification, or from
individual plants according to a phytoplasma enrichment procedure (Marzachi et al.,
1999). ESFYP was identified with immunoenzymatic detection of PCR products (PCR-
ELISA), using primer pair fOI/rOI and an ESFYP-specific probe as described previously
(Poggi Pollini et al., 2001a). PCR products, initially amplified with universal ribosomal
primer pair R16F2/R2, were diluted to 1:40 and 2 ul aliquots were used as templates in
nested-PCR reactions primed by one of the group-specific primer pairs (I, III, V, X) (Lee
et al., 1995) to evaluate the presence of other phytoplasmas alone or in association with
ESFYP. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results obtained showed that numerous groups of C. pruni, captured in all
provinces on different stone fruit trees (P. cerasifera, P. persica and P. spinosa) were
infected by ESFYP. Other psyllids, one from each group of Bactericera curvatinervis,
Laurotrioza alacris and Trioza urticae, were also found to be infected by ESFYP. In the
winter traps placed on conifers, only one group of C. pyrisuga (Forster), captured on C.
leylandii in the Verona province in 2002, was positive for ESFYP. Out of the numerous leafhoppers tested, there were only two positive groups of
Macrosteles cristatus (Ribaut), collected from peach trees in the summer of 2000 in the
Verona province (Table 3). Further tests on these leafhoppers in subsequent years did not
however confirm these results. The occasional finding of ESFYP in leafhoppers has
already been reported (Jarausch et al., 2001b). The results obtained indicate that PCR-ELISA is reliable and can also be used for
specific detection of ESFYP in insects, as previously demonstrated for AP and pear
decline (PD) phytoplasmas in its vectors. Furthermore, it offers a greater sensitivity than
gel electrophoresis (Poggi Pollini et al., 2001b). No phytoplasmas belonging to other
groups (I, III, V) or other phytoplasmas of the same AP-group (X) were detected in the
insects examined. As regards the wild plants examined, various P. cerasifera and P. spinosa trees
and occasionally other wild Prunus were found to be infected, although most were
asymptomatic. The largest number of infected psyllids were captured precisely on these
trees (Table 4 and 5). No phytoplasmas were found, even using nested-PCR, in the other
plants with suspicious phytoplasma symptoms or in symptomless plants. It can be concluded that individual infected C. pruni were present in the peach
orchards of all the provinces examined. At present the intensive testing of insects suggests
there is no important secondary vector of ESFYP in peach orchards in Northern Italy;
however the role of other psyllids in ESFYP transmission will be evaluated. As regards the wild plants surrounding the peach orchards, only wild Prunus were
found to be infected by ESFYP. The possible role of additional plant hosts in the spread
of the disease, as suggested in France (Jarausch et al, 2001a), was not confirmed by our
research, since all the methods used failed to detect ESFYP in these species. Wild Prunus around the peach orchards certainly play a role in the epidemiology
of the disease. As already indicated in the past, they represent good hosts for ESFYP,
without showing symptoms, as well as for the insect vector (Carraro et al., 2001; Jarausch
et al., 2001b). This indicates the importance of including these plants in a control program
to eliminate the vector psyllid. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
