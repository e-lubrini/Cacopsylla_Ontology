Abstract 
 
We studied the overwintering of psyllids on conifers in two h
illy sites in the Czech Republic, South Moravia: the Drahanská 
vrchovina Highlands and the Pavlovské vrchy 
Hills. Using a sweeping net on a long stic
k we collected altogether 3304 specimens 
of Psylloidea. In the Drahanská vrchovina, 27 species were found;
 80 % of specimens belonged to the potential phytoplasma vec-
tors 
Cacopsylla pruni 
(Scopoli), 
Cacopsylla picta 
(Förster), 
Cacopsylla melanoneura 
(Förster), and 
Cacopsylla pyrisuga 
(För-
ster). In the Pavlovské vrchy, 
10 species were ascertained and 
C. melanoneura
 as the only phytoplasma vector was represented in 
2.9 % of specimens. A high representation of phytoplasma vectors 
on conifers in the Moravian hi
ghlands can be explained by a 
long-distance migration of freshly mature psyllid specimens whic
h would be carried from lowlands by ascending thermic cur-
rents, drifted by winds and de
posited on hills by turbulence. 
 
Key words:

Introduction 
 
A few species from the psyllid genus 
Cacopsylla
 (He-
miptera Psyllidae) have recently proved to be vectors of 
phytoplasmas, which belong to the apple proliferation 
cluster and seriously damage fruit trees (Tedeschi 
et al.
, 
2002; Frisinghelli 
et al
., 2000; Carraro 
et al
., 1998; 
Grbic, 1974). Of these, 
Cacopsylla melanoneura 
(För-
ster), 
Cacopsylla picta 
(Förster), 
Cacopsylla pruni
 
(Scopoli) and 
Cacopsylla pyrisuga
 (Förster) can be im-
portant vectors in the Czech Republic. These species 

overwinter in the adult stage and like most psyllids with 
a similar life cycle, they may be found on conifers dur-

ing the winter. However, they have been so far collected 
by most authors on conifers only rarely and in low 
numbers (Tedeschi 
et al
. 2002). The four above men-
tioned species occur frequently on their host plants in 

the lowlands of South Moravia (south-eastern part of the 

Czech Republic) (Lauterer, 19
99) but are mostly absent 
in few artificially planted lowland conifer stands in their 

vicinity. Recently, we have 
focused on locating over-
wintering sites and monitoring migration of psyllids in 
South Moravia. We have supposed that lowland psyllids 
might migrate to overwintering sites situated on more 

distant hills. 
 
 
Materials and methods 
 
We collected overwintering psyllids on conifers at two 

hilly sites in South Moravia in 2005-2007: (A) the 
er-
vený vrch and the Kale
ník Hills in the Drahanská 
vrchovina Highland (49° 15™ N, 16° 50™ E, 479-535 m 

a.s.l.) on spruce; (B) the top of the Pálava Hill in the 
Pavlovské vrchy Hills (48° 52™ N, 16° 39™ E, 462 m 
a.s.l.) on pine trees. The site A was visited on 5 and 18 

March 2006 and then regularly each month from August 
2006 till June 2007, the site B was visited twice on 4 

December 2005 and 19 March 
2006. On each date psyl-
lids were collected with the same time-limited sampling 

effort (5 hours) using a sweep net on a 5 m long stick. In 

total, the samples included 3304 specimens of Psyl-
loidea (Site A: 3029 specimens, Site B: 275 specimens). 
 

 
Results and discussion 
 
Altogether, we
 
found
 
27
 
species 
of 
Psylloidea (i.e. 22% of
 
the Czech fauna), including 
all the four vectors, over-
wintering on spruce at site A, while only 10 psyllid spe-
cies (8%) were collected on 
pine trees at site B where 
only 
C. melanoneura
 was recorded from the vector spe-
cies. The following species were found at site A: 
C. 
melanoneura 
(65.4%), 
C. pruni
 (11.1%), 
Trioza remota
 
Förster (7.8%), 
C. picta
 (2.2%), 
Trioza urticae
 (L.) 
(2.2%), 
Aphalara maculipennis 
Löw (1.4%), 
Cacop-
sylla brunneipennis 
(Edwards) (1.7%), 
C. pyrisuga 
(1.3%), 
Cacopsylla pulchra
 (Zetterstedt) (1.1%), 
Ca-
copsylla saliceti 
(Förster) (1.1%), 
Aphalara avicularis

Cacopsylla rhamnicola 
(Scott), 
Trioza apicalis 
Förster, 
Trioza flavipennis 
Förster, 
Trioza rhamni
 
(Schrank) and 
Trioza rotundata
 Flor (all less than 1%). 
At site B, the samples included 
T. remota
 (49.8%), 
B. 
albiventris
 (12.0%), 
B. nigricornis
 (10.2%), 
T. urticae
 
(11.6%), 
C. pulchra 
(5.8%), 
C. saliceti

Despite a lower number of samples from pines we sug-

gest that spruce trees can be prefered over pines as shel-
ter plants by the overwintering psyllids in South Mora-
via. However, e.g. 
C. picta 
was frequently found to

). 
The spring migration of psyllids from conifers onto 
host plants starts at the beginning of March. The migra-

tion of a new psyllid generation from host plants back 
onto conifers takes place one week after adult emer-
gence, ca. at the end of May for 
C. brunneipennis
, 
C. 
melanoneura
 and 
C. pulchra
, and in June for 
C. picta
, 
C. pruni
, 
C. pyrisuga 
and 
C. rhamnicola
. 
We suggest that the migration of psyllids onto conifers 
would follow the ﬁhilltoppingﬂ principle. Accordingly, 

the vector 
Cacopsylla 
spp. would be passively carried 
by ascending aerial currents rising from unevenly 
heated land surface in warm summer days up to tens of 
kilometres away from the ho
st plants in lowlands and 
deposited on tree tops when
 the currents reach moun-
tains or hills and lose their carrying capacity in turbu-

lences. Psyllid individuals might consequently actively 

search for appropriate conife
r trees to overwinter. Such 
aerial currents, which would be suitable for passive 

psyllid migration rise only in the long day period (JuneŒ

August) between 11 a.m. and 4-5 p.m. At that period 
south and south-east winds prevail in the studied region 
and predetermined psyllid migration ways. The ascend-

ing currents don™t rise in the short day period, hence 
those psyllid species in which adults of a new genera-
tion appear too early (April-May) or too late (Septem-

ber-November) can migrate only to short distances. 
In order to investigate psyllids which overwinter on 
conifers we recommend sampling the trees at a height of 
at least 5 m above ground. 
The use of a long stick 
brought samples richer in sp
ecies and individuals than 
beating the lowest tree branches.
