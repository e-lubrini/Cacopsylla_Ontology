Psylla kananaskensis sp. nov. and Psylla subspiculata sp. nov. are described from specimens
collected off Salix sp. in the Kananaskis Valley, Alberta, Canada. Psylla kananaskensis is close
to P. arcuata Loginova; P. subspiculata is close to P. spiculata Jensen and P. parallela Crawford. A new dioecous subspecies of Psylla myrtilli is also described from specimens collected off
Vaccinium myrtittus L. in the same locality. In addition the following species are recorded from
Canada for the first time: Aphalara nubifera Patch, Craspedolepta alaskensis (Ashmead), C.
minutissima (Crawford), C. subpunctata (Foerster), Trioza obtusa (Patch) and T. pletschi

exists to indicate strong faunal affinities with the Palaearctic region. This paper
represents the results of two years’ intensive collecting in Alberta. Psylla kananaskensis sp. nov.

Psylla kananaskensis is closest to Psylla arcuata Loginova (1965), a northern
Russian species which most probably feeds on Salix sp. (Loginova, 1967). The
two species are easily separated on the form of the male parameres and the
absence of spinules from the apical cells of the fore wing in kananaskensis. Psylla kananaskensis can be separated from all known Psylla spp. on the shape
of the parameres. Biology

Nymphs and adults of P. kananaskensis were found in association with Psylla
sinuata Crawford, Psylla minor Crawford and Psylla sp. near fibulata Crawford. However, despite extensive searches, no overwintering nymphs or adults of P.
kananaskensis could be found, and this suggests that it overwinters in the egg
stage, undergoes nymphal development during June and July and emerges as an
adult during August. Psylla subspiculata sp. nov.

Head (Fig. 10) slightly narrower than thorax; vertex 0.44-0.54 times as long
as broad; genal cones blunt, 0.83-0.94 times the length of the vertex,
convergent basally. Antennae of typical Psylla form, 10 segmented, 1.47-1.63
times head width, with sensorial pits on segments 4, 6, 8 and 9, and two long
apical setae on segment 10; ocelli small, borne on small tubercles close to the
hind margin of the eye. Thorax of typical Psylla form, moderately arched. Fore wing (Fig. 9)
membranous, 2.38-2.72 times as long as broad, of typical Psylla venation;
pterostigma long but narrow, about one quarter the width of cell R,; dense,
light coloured spinules covering whole membrane of fore wing except for
narrow spinule free bands along the veins; height to basal width ratio of cell
Cu, 0.52-0.64. Hind wings membranous of typical Psylla form; hairs on either
side of costal fracture arranged 1 (occasionally 2)+ 6 to 9 in dd, 1
(occasionally 2) + 6 to 10 in 99. Fore and mid legs simple; hind legs saltatorial,
mercanthi well developed; apex of hind tibiae with 4 or 5 (variable) thick black
spines; basal metatarsi with 2 black spines. Abdomen (Figs 11 to 16) lacking diagnostic features except for terminalia. Male proctiger simple, sparsely hairy basally, densely hairy on apical half. Male
parameres (Figs 11 to 13) slightly shorter than proctiger, densely setiferous
posteriorly and with a small posterior basal projection; in lateral view posterior
margin convex basally, becoming straight in its apical two-thirds; anterior
margin strongly concave in basal one-third, strongly convex in mid one-third
and strongly concave in apical one-third; apex formed by a large asymmetrical

Psylla subspiculata is closely related to Psylla spiculata Jensen (1951) and P.
parallela Crawford (1914). Jensen (1951) discusses the separation of the latter
two species; the following table summarizes the main characters which separate
P. subspiculata from P. spiculata. P. subspiculata P. spiculata

much taxonomic confusion (Heslop-Harrison, 1951; Vondracek, 1959). Biology

Nymphs and adults of Psylla subspiculata were found in association with
Psylla hamata Tuthill. Psylla subspiculata overwinters in the adult stage, as
evidenced by the presence of highly pigmented female adults in late May and
early June. Psylla myrtilli canadensis ssp. nov.

Twelve type specimens of P. myrtilli canadensis have been deposited in the
British Museum (Natural History). Data attached to these specimens are as
follows: ex. Vaccinium myrtillus L., Barrier Mountain (1830 m_ az.s.l. ),
Kananaskis Valley, Alberta, Canada, 9 September 1973 (coll. I. D. Hodkinson). Comment

Psylla myrtilli was described from Europe by Wagner (1947). His type series
included a single male specimen which has subsequently been shown to be P.
corcontum Sule and hence not conspecific with the females in the series
(Ossiannilsson, 1975). The male of P. myrtilli remains unknown in Europe
where the species is probably totally parthenogenetic (Linnawori, 1951;
Lauterer, 1963). However, occasional males have been taken in the U.S.S.R.
and China (Loginova, pers comm. ; Kuwayama & Miyatake, 1971;
Ossiannilsson, 1975). The newly discovered Nearctic form of P. myrtilli is very similar morpho-
logically to the Palaearctic form but differs in the length of the antennae. Furthermore it almost certainly reproduces sexually, as males and females
occur in roughly equal proportions. Insufficient material is available to
establish whether the two forms are specifically distinct and thus the Canadian
form has been given subspecific status. Two further Vaccinium-feeding species P. vaccinii Miyatake and P. amabilis
Ossiannilsson occur in Japan and the U.S.S.R. respectively, but they are
distinct from both subspecies of P. myrtilli (see Miyatake, 1964; Ossiannilsson,
1975). Biology
The biology of Psylla myrtilli canadensis is unknown. NEW RECORDS FOR CANADA

The following species are recorded for the first time from Canada. 1. Aphalara nubifera Patch. 16d, 19° from Rumex pauciflorus Nuttall, 27 June
1972, Kananaskis Valley, Alberta. 2. Craspedolepta alaskensis (Ashmead). Abundant on Epilobium angustifolium
L., 20 July 1973, Highwood Pass summit (2135 m a.s.l. ), Alberta. 3. Craspedolepta minutissima (Crawford). Abundant on Artemisia sp., 16 June
1972, Drumheller Badlands, Alberta. 330 1. D. HODKINSON

4. Craspedolepta subpunctata (Forster). Abundant on Epilobium angustifolium
L., 6 June 1972 and 5 June 1973, Kananaskis Valley, Alberta. Craspedolepta
hebecephala (Caldwell) is probably synonymous with this holarctic species. 5. Trioza obtusa Patch, Abundant on Ameliancher alnifolia Nuttall, 27 August
to 8 September 1973, Kananaskis Valley, Alberta. 6. Trioza pletschi Tuthill. 16d, 199 from Thalictrum venulosum Trel., 26
August 1973, Kananaskis Valley, Alberta. 899? from Thalictrum sp., 20 July
1973, Highwood Pass summit, Alberta, are probably referable to this species. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I thank Dr L. M. Russell and Dr M. M. Loginova for comparing specimens
