First records of the psyllids Livilla ulicis (CURTIS) and Spanioneura fonscolombii (FORSTER) from
Belgium, and Trichochermes walkeri (FORSTER) from both Belgium and Great-Duchy of Luxembourg. Keywords: Homoptera, Psylloidea, Faunistics, Belgium, Great-Duchy of Luxembourg. Summary

First report of the psyllids Livilla ulicis (CURTIS), Spanioneura fonscolombii (FORSTER) and
Trichochermes walkeri (FORSTER) in Belgium, the latter species also being reported from Grand-

Duchy of Luxemburg. The Homoptera Psylloidea of ​​Belgium and
of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are very badly
known and have practically never been the subject
faunal studies. The few entomologists
regional authorities who have considered this group have
been active mainly at the end of the 19th century; they
moreover bequeathed to us the only catalogs
available for our country (LETHIERRY, 1892;
COUBEAUX, 1892)! The works listed in
neighboring regions are hardly newer
for the most part: let us quote REIBER & PUTON (1880)
and MALENOVSKY (1999) for Lorraine and
Alsace, LETHIERRY (1874) for the department
du Nord and BLOTE (1926) for the Netherlands. One of the main reasons for such disinterest
on the part of researchers is undoubtedly
in very modest size and great delicacy
of these insects, making their preparation and
difficult study. In addition, the Psylloidea have always
days presented many taxono-
nomic and nomenclatural, which appear
today feels somewhat muted 4 more

Richly _ illustrated determination keys,
like those of HODKINSON & WHITE (1979) and
by OSSIANNILSSON (1992). If COUBEAUX (1892) listed 48 species of

20

Psylloidea whose occurrence was, at the time,
deemed certain or probable on Belgian territory,
it is currently impossible to establish the
real number. Taking into account, on the one hand,
inventories available for more or less
less close, and on the other hand of the effective presence
of the host plants, it can however be estimated
sea ​​this number has about 80. But there is still
to do, particularly in terms of pros-
pection, before reaching 4 a better
faunal knowledge of these insects. In this
framework, good notions of botany turn out to be
necessary to the extent yes all Psylloidea
are not only phytophagous (suckers of
sap) but also highly specialized in the
choice of their food plants. During surveys carried out mainly in
Fagne-Famenne, in Calestienne and in the valley
of the Meuse, we had the opportunity to
capture three unusual species, the pre-
sence in Belgium does not seem to have been established
until this day. They have in common to have a
unique appearance within the Psylloidea and little-
can thus be recognized very easily. The detail
of these observations accompanied by some
comments is given below. Speci-
reference mens have been deposited in the collec-
Belgian version of the I.R.Sc.N.B. in Brussels. Livilla ulicis (CURTIS, 1829)

at least 100 ad., calcareous grassland 4 Juniperus en-
held by the rabbits (rec. J.-Y. Baugnée). Distributed mainly in southern Europe
nal and central, this species nevertheless reaches
England, where it seems widespread (HODKIN-
SON & WHITE, 1979), North Germany
(HAUuPT, 1936) as well as Poland (KLIMA-
ZEWSKI, 1973), but not Fenno-Scandinavia,
Denmark nor, it seems, the Netherlands (Os-
SIANNILSSON, 1992). Although old, his signa-
North-East of France by REIBER &
PUTON (1880) foreshadowed its existence in
Belgium. Despite their tiny size (2 mm),
imagos of L. ulicis are easily recognized
sables & their wings dark brown and strongly
convex, giving 4 these insects a glo-
characteristic bubbly. This psyllid seems very faithful
with dyers' broom, Genista tinctoria, well
that literature (cf. KLIMAZEWSKI, 1973) men-
also includes other Fabaceae such as Ononis
spinosa and Ulex europaeus. As it concerns
our observations, it should be noted that they have all been
carried out in the presence of G. tinctoria. In the
region, it is a widespread undershrub
mainly within the Mosan and Lor-
rain (cf. VAN ROMPAEY & DELVOSALLE, 1979)
ott it colonizes lawns and forest edges
both on schistose and calcareous soils. L. ulicis is found in the adult stage of May 4

regions of Europe: Spain, France, Switzerland, Germany

observations of S. fonscolombii, still very fragile

country is hardly surprising because its distribution
Europe is very vast. His presence was thus
attested in Scandinavia, Great Britain,
Germany, Switzerland, France, etc.. In this last
countries, the species is however not cited from North-
East (LETHIERRY, 1874; REIBER & PUTON, 1880;
MALENOVSKY, 1999) but exists there more than
most likely. For the Netherlands, DOCTERS VAN
LEEUWEN (1982) indicates that 7. walkeri is
common where its host plant grows, i.e. the
purgative buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica, on which
the larvae induce leaf galls very
typical and visible throughout the summer (Fig. 1). In
Belgium, this calcicole and thermophilic shrub is
mainly encountered on warm slopes
of the Mosan basin, but also in Lorraine (cf. VAN ROMPAEY & DELVOSALLE, 1979). The occurrence of T. walkeri on Frangula alnus (=

Rhamnus frangula) has also been mentioned
by various authors (books on oncology, by
ex.) but in twenty years of research, LAUTE-
RER (1982) specifies that he could not observe the
lower reproductive index on this shrub. According to the observations of this same author in
Czechoslovakia, the biological cycle of this
species produces a single annual generation. Oviposition takes place in autumn but the eggs
do not hatch until the following spring; the larvae
develop during the summer, the adult insects
generally appear from July and survive
until October, sometimes later. These latter
have a very remarkable look, with their wings
acuminate and mostly stained brown. We should also specify that the Cacopsylla psyllids
rhamnicola| (SCOTT) and Trioza rhamni
(SCHRANK)' also evolve on R. catharti-
ca but their larvae are not (or barely) blind.

relatives (DAUPHIN & ANIOTSBEHERE, 1993; Os-
