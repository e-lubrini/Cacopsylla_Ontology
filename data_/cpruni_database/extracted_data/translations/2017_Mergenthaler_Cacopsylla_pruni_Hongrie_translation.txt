Abstract

This study aimed to obtain data on the seasonal activity, preferred host plants, and phytoplasma infection status of the psyllid
Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli), vector of European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) phytoplasma (*Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’)
in Hungary. Individuals of C. pruni were found throughout the whole collection period at all localities studied. In the year 2014
the reimmigrants were found on Prunus from March to May and the new generation from May to June, with a peak of the popula-
tion at the end of April. The preferred host plants appeared to be myrabolan (P. cerasifera), followed by blackthorn (P. spinosa),
and other Prunus species. Ratio of male and female individuals varied in the collection period, with a substantial decrease of male
presence in case of reimmigrants. Concerning phytoplasma infection of the species captured in the studied orchards, our results
showed that individuals of C. pruni were infected by ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in the overwintering as well as in the new generation. The
ratio of the ESFY infected psyllids was uniformly 15% in the males and females, and slightly higher (16%) in the nymphs. Mo-
lecular classification of C. pruni individuals by the ITS primer set 3 assigned unambiguously all the collected C. pruni specimens

into genetic group B. Key words: psyllid, vector, Cacopsylla pruni, ESFY, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’. Introduction

European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) (Lorenz et al.,
1994) caused by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’
(Seemiiller and Schneider, 2004) is prevalent in the
most important stone fruit production areas of Central
and Southern Europe. It causes substantial impact in ap-
ricots, Japanese plums and peaches (Marcone ef al.,
2010), but also affects different Prunus species. It is one
of the most important diseases of apricot on several
growing sites in Hungary (Tarcali and Kévics, 2012). This pathogen can be transmitted and spread by
propagation material and the psyllid vector, Cacopsylla
pruni (Scopoli), the vector of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’
(Carraro ef al., 1998). C. pruni is an univoltine psyllid,
strictly oligophagous on Prunus, and widespread in
Europe (Marcone et al., 2010). In spring, eggs of
C. pruni are laid by overwintering adults on Prunus spp. Individuals of new generations develop on Prunus spp. through five nymphal stages into adults, and new adults
abandon the reproduction host in summer to overwinter
on conifers (Ossiannilsson, 1992; Thébaud et al., 2009). Studies suggest that C. pruni individuals returning to
Prunus spp. in spring (reimmigrants) are the most effi-
cient disease vectors. A secondary spread of ESFY
within the orchard during the vegetation period seems to
have less significance (Carraro et al., 2004; Thébaud et
al., 2009). Population dynamics, mechanism of trans-
mission and transmission efficiency of C. pruni have
been studied intensively in several European countries
(Carraro et al., 2001; Jarausch et al., 2001; Steffek et
al., 2012). In Hungary a few data on the life cycle and
population dynamics of Cacopsylla spp. are available
(Ripka, 2008; 2010; Ripka and Kiss, 2008), and only
one study has been performed to survey the role of
C. pruni in ESFY epidemiology (Siile, 2014). Although

in our conditions C. pruni population density does usu-
ally not cause direct damages to the crops, their ability
to transmit ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ requires a correct orchard
management in order to prevent the spread of ESFY. The aim of our work was to determine the occurrence
and population dynamics of C. pruni in selected apricot
orchards in Hungary, to list the preferred host plants,
and to gain information on the phytoplasma infection
status of this psyllid species in Hungary. As no direct
treatment of the disease is possible, monitoring of the
psyllids provides information about the vector presence
in the orchards and enables targeted control. Recent studies in France and northern Spain demon-
strated the existence of two strongly, genetically differ-
entiated, but morphologically similar groups of C. pruni
(Sauvion et al., 2007), that often occur sympatrically. Peccoud et al. (2013) developed a molecular identifica-
tion method to distinguish the individuals of the genetic
groups A and B of the C. pruni species complex. This
method is based on polymorphisms within the ribosomal
Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 region of the two C. pruni
genetic groups. The diagnostic PCR developed in this
study by Peccoud et al. (2013) is a fast, cost-effective
and reliable tool to assign individuals of C. pruni species
complex to genetic groups that appear to constitute di-
vergent species. Our objective is to classify the collected
C. pruni specimens into the above mentioned A and B
biotypes, in order to gain information about the popula-
tion structure of plum psyllid in Hungary. Materials and methods

Insects were caught from six apricot orchards in differ-
ent locations in Hungary (Pest county (4), Somogy
county (1), Borsod-Abaij-Zemplén county (1) using the

1

combination of beating tray and sweep netting method
in 2014 between beginning of March and end of June. Collections have been performed at least once in every
month (altogether 4 times) at the orchards in Pest
county, two times (in April and May) at Bekecs
(Borsod-Abaiij-Zemplén county), and once (in April) at
Somogytir (Somogy county) (table 1). Sampling sites
had been previously surveyed for the presence of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ and high ESFY disease incidence was ob-
served in all orchards. Psyllids were collected from ap-
ricot trees and suckers, but also from wild Prunus spe-
cies growing alongside the investigated orchards. No
insecticide treatments were applied in the studied or-
chards. The sample collection unit was defined as the number
of psyllids obtained by beating around one tree for three
minutes with a 0.28 m” beating tray, except for suckers,
where 1-2 beat was enough. At least ten cultivated fruit
and/or wild Prunus tree per orchard have been sampled
at one collection time. The C. pruni falling on the tray
were directly counted and collected with a mouth aspi-
rator to confirm later their identity and sex under a ste-
reomicroscope. Insects were moved immediately into a sample tube
containing 80% ethanol and later individually observed
under stereomicroscope for proper identification and sex
characterization. Samples were stored at —20 °C until
tested for phytoplasma infection. Total DNA was extracted from single psyllid indi-
viduals by modified Doyle and Doyle (1990) method. Cacopsylla DNA samples have been bulked into groups
containing 10 individuals. The detection of phytoplas-
mas in bulked groups was performed using nested-PCR
with AP group-specific primers Eof/Eor (Mergenthaler,

(Jarausch ef al., 1998). In case of having amplification
product, each individual sample of the bulked groups
has been tested. Amplification with Eof/Eor and
ECAIECA2 primers was performed as follows: 3 min
at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94 °C, 30 sec at 55 °C,
30 sec at 72 °C and a final extension of 15 min at 72 °C. Total DNA from ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ infected apricot
plants were used as positive controls. PCR was per-
formed in a final volume of 15 iL containing: 7.5 wL of
ThermoScientific DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix
(2x) (containing 4 mM MgCl, 0.4 mM of each dNTP),
0.4 uM of each primer and 1 wL of DNA extract. Molecular classification of the 281 C. pruni individu-
als into A or B genetic groups have been achieved by
the ITS primer set 3 (Cp135F as universal primer and
CpA425R and CpB315R as specific primers). ITS
primer set 3 was chosen for amplification because this
set gave the most reliable result for almost all the indi-
viduals tested by Peccoud et al. (2013), especially for
the individuals in group B. The expected PCR frag-
ments size are 293 bp (A) and 177 bp (B). Amplifica-
tion with Cp135F, CpA425R and CpB315R primers was
performed as follows: 5 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 30
sec at 94 °C, 20 sec at 65 °C, 30 sec at 72 °C and a final
extension of 5 min at 72 °C. PCR was performed in a
final volume of 15 wL containing: 1.5 uL 10 buffer,
0.625 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 2.5 mM MgCh, 0.4
mM of each dNTP, 0.2 1M of each primer and 1 pL of
DNA extract. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis
through a 1% or 2% (when using the ITS primer set 3)
agarose gel and visualized by staining with GelRed
(Biotium, USA). Results

Individuals of C. pruni (adult reimmigrants that have
overwintered and new generation) were found through-
out the whole period at all localities studied. The pre-
ferred host plants appeared to be myrabolan (P. cerasif~
era), followed by blackthorn (P. spinosa), European
plum (P. domestica) and other Prunus species (table 2). Many of the psyllids have been collected from black-
thorn and myrabolan hedges close to the orchards. In-
terestingly, psyllids have been found, but very rarely on
apricot plants during the whole period. However, insects
were caught in orchards where P. domestica or P. cera-
sifera were used as rootstock and provided an abundant
sucker production. The reimmigrants were found on Prunus from March
to May and the new generation from May to June, with
a peak of population at the end of April (figure 1). The
migration of the new generation from host plants back
onto conifers takes place at the end of June, since not
any C. pruni was found on Prunus after the end of June. The highest population level was reached in April-
May, which decreased to about a half in June, when the
overwintering adults already died and adults of the new
generation started to move back to conifers (figure 1). Nymphs of C. pruni were first detected on P. spinosa at

May and June. Male and female percentages varied in the collection
period, with a substantial decrease of male presence in
case of reimmigrants. In contrast to this, adult males and
females were close to equally represented in the new
generation before they left their summer hosts for over-
wintering (figures 2 and 3). Results obtained on the
male/female percentages when the reimmigrants were
present at the orchards, evidenced the longevity of fe-
males, representing in May 85% of the population (fig-
ure 3). The results of phytoplasma detection in the individu-
als of C. pruni captured on different host plants, in dif-
ferent locations and in different collection times are
shown in table 3. Molecular analyses of C. pruni
showed that forty three out of 281 tested samples were
positive to ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ that corresponds to 15%
total infection rate. The ratio of the ‘Ca. P. prunorum’
infected psyllids was uniformly 15% in the males and
females, and somewhat higher (16%) in the nymphs. Infection rates at all samplings sites were around the
average 14%, except one location (Somogytir: 8%),
most probably due to the low number of samples. The
higher percentage of reimmigrant individuals of
C. pruni infected by ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ was around 28%
and was found in Bekecs. 150

carrying the phytoplasma increased from March to June,
most probably because they fed on infected trees. The
infection rate of the first captured reimmigrants in
March was 16%, and reached a value slightly exceeding
20% in the last captures. “Ca. P. prunorum’ was identified in C. pruni individu-
als collected from almost all host plants. It is remarkable

that the ratio of infected insects from P. spinosa and
suckers are slightly above the average, which suggests
that rootstocks and blackthorn are preferred feeding site
for C. pruni and those can be considered as an important
inoculum source. Molecular characterization of C. pruni individuals per-
formed with the ITS primer set 3 showed the presence
of a 177 bp amplified fragment in all tested groups of
individuals (figure 4B), corresponding to the genetic
group B. None of the 29 groups produced amplicons of
different sizes, so all groups can be considered homoge-
nous. The collected Cacopsylla crataegi (Schrank) and
Cacopsylla picta (Foerster) individuals identified on the
base of morphological traits produced no PCR ampli-
cons (figure 4A). Discussion

This survey confirmed the occurrence of C. pruni and
its moderate infectivity in the sampled regions, where
ESFY disease is endemic and affects both cultivated and
wild Prunus species. This infectivity rate is in agree-
ment with records reported from other countries in
Europe. In France, the highest range of phytoplasma in-
fected reimmigrant C. pruni was recorded as 15% but is
generally around 3% (Yvon et al., 2004). In Turkey, this
range was determined as 23% what seems somewhat
higher (Serge et a/., 2011). Ermacora et al. (2011) de-
termined in a two year survey in North-Eastern Italy, that
the infection rate of the first capture reimmigrants was
56.4% and reached a plateau slightly exceeding 80%. Concerning phytoplasma infection of the species cap-
tured in the studied orchards, our results showed that the
overwintering as well as in the new generation of C.
pruni carried the phytoplasma. It means that C. pruni
can act as a vector of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ both as over-
wintered and springtime adults. These findings fit with
other studies that both generations are infected (Fialova
et al., 2007), however some authors ascribe higher sig-
nificance to the overwintering generation in phyto-
plasma transmission (Thébaud et al., 2008). Since not only sparse, but prevalent incidence of im-
migrants have been found on different Prunus species
from the middle of March, the migration of psyllids
from conifers onto host plants could have been started
already at the beginning of March or even at the end of
February. Immatures of C. pruni were first detected on
P. spinosa at the end of April, and later from other Pru-
nus species. This is in agreement with the observations
of Labonne and Lichou (2004), those who designated
blackthorn as a “sentinel species”. The first activity of
the insect could be performed more easily on P. spinosa
than in orchards on cultivated Prunus species. P. cerasifera and P. spinosa appeared to be two most
preferred host plants in Hungary compared to the other
Prunus spp. studied. This host plant preference is partly
in agreement with previous records from other countries
(Labonne and Lichou, 2004, Serge et al., 2011). Experiencing the presence of C. pruni individuals on
suckers lead to the instant removal of these shoots in
selected apricot orchards. This is the reason for data
showing the occurrence only of adults of C. pruni and
not of nymphs on suckers. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 1314 15 16 17 18 19

lane 19: negative control. Surprisingly, we were able to find only very few indi-
viduals of C. pruni on apricot trees during the whole pe-
riod. This raises the question of whether only that insect
species alone is responsible for the quick spreading of
this lethal disease in Hungarian apricot orchards. This
has to be answered in the future, nevertheless the key
role of the uncontrolled phytoplasma-infected propaga-
tion material is suggested. Results obtained on the male/female percentages when
the reimmigrant individuals are present in the orchards,
evidenced the longevity of females that at the end of the
monitored period represented 88.5% of the population. The longevity of females could be explained from an
evolutionary point of view considering the crucial role
of the females for the species survival. Females seem to survive longer than males, which
seems to correspond with their crucial role for the spe-
cies survival. The diagnostic PCR developed by Peccoud et al. (2013) proved to be a fast and reliable tool to assign in-
dividuals of C. pruni to genetic groups. All the collected
insects could be unambiguously defined into the genetic
group B. Our results are congruent with the observa-
tions of this study, where samples originated from the
eastern part of Europe (Serbia, Czech Republic, North-
ern Italy, Germany) and from Asia (Turkey) contained
individuals uniformly classified into genetic group B. A
recent study (Oettl and Schlink, 2015) refine further the
problem of C. pruni species complex, indicating the

 

 

 

presence of not only A and B, but further genetic groups
of C. pruni. These and other studies support the neces-
sity of further analysis on C. pruni genetic groups. Sev-
eral authors hypothesized putative connection betwe
host plant preference/transmission efficiency and ge-
netic variants of different Cacopsylla species (Sauvion
et al., 2007, Tedeschi and Nardi, 2010). These molecu-
lar techniques could be a useful tool for study on distri-
bution of plum psyllid, its host plants and its ability of
the ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ transmission. In conclusion, occurrence of the plum psyllid in Hun-
gary have been confirmed both with morphological and
molecular methods. Our studies show the presence of
the vector belonging to genetic group B in all the inves-
tigated localities and the high infection rates reveal a
high spread risk of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ by C. pruni in
Hungary. Future investigations will aim to monitor
regularly C. pruni in these and other fruit tree growing
areas of Hungary for possible phytoplasma infections. Acknowledgements
