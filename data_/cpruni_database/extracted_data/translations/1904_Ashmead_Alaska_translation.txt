THE HOMOPTERA OF ALASKA

BY WILLIAM H. ASHMEAD

INTRODUCTION

Tue insects of the suborder Homoptera found in Alaska, in
comparison with those in the other orders taken by the Harri-
man Expedition, are few in number and somewhat disappoint-
ing, although they add considerably to our knowledge of the
Alaska fauna. Few species of rhynchotous insects have been
recorded from this territory, and our knowledge is most meager. Dr. C. Stal, in a paper entitled ‘ Beitrag zur Hemipteren-
Fauna Siberiens und des Russischen Nord-Amerika,’ pub-
lished in 1858,’ was the first to record any species from
Alaska. In this contribution Dr. Stal enumerated, in all, 113 species,
of which only thirteen came from Alaska, and nearly all
of these were collected at Sitka. Substantially, this was all
that was known of the fauna up to the date of the Harriman
Expedition. Some of the Rhynchota taken by the Expedition
have already been reported upon: (1) The Heteroptera, by O.
Heideman; (2) the Psyllide, by E. A. Schwarz; and (3) the

Aphidide, by Theo. Pergande. In studying the remaining un-
worked material I have here followed my usual plan, and shall
give a complete list of all the species in the suborder Homoptera
now known to occur in Alaska, arranged in systematic order. In all, twenty-four species are known in this suborder, ar-
ranged under five families and thirteen genera. Of the species,
four have a wide distribution in Europe and North America,
namely, Zuacanthus acuminatus (Fabr. ), Deltocephalus abdomr-
nalis (Fabr. ), Czcadula sexnotata (Fallen), and C. fasczifrons
(Stal), and will ultimately be found to occur in northern Asia. Cicadula leta (Uhler) occurs in Colorado and Labrador. SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT. Order RHYNCHOTA. Suborder Homoptera. Superfamily (ULGORO/DEA Ashmead.’
Family DELPHACIDA. Genus Delphax Fabricius. DELPHAX STEJNEGERI Ashmead. Delphax steynegert ASHM., Fur Seals and Fur Seal Isl., Iv, 340, 1899. Type.—Cat. No. 4046, U. S. Nat. Mus., from Pribilof Islands,
Bering Sea. Additional specimens from Metlakatla, June 4; Popof
Island, Shumagin Islands, July 8; Farragut Bay, June 5. This species was originally described from a single female specimen
taken by Dr. L. Stejneger on Bering Island. Several specimens were
taken by the Harriman Expedition, among which are two brachyp-
terous males that differ from the female as follows:

Length 2.4mm. The face, except the frontal and the clypeal carine,
the scutellum, except the carinze and the extreme lateral and posterior
margins, the depressions on the sides of the pronotum, the mesopleura,
except laterally and the sutures, the mesonotum, most of the coxe and
most of the abdomen, except the first and second sutures and some-
times the extreme lateral margins of dorsal segments, the extreme
upper edges of the pygofers and the circular disk, surrounding the
cerci, which are pale yellowish, are black; otherwise, except in the
usual sexual difference, it agrees with the female. 1The Superfamily Cicadoidea is not yet reported from Alaska, but undoubtedly has

representatives in the interior. HOMOPTERA 131
