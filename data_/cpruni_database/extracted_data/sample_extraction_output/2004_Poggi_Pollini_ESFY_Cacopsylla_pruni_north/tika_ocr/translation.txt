The discovery of the natural vector of ESFY phytoplasma, the psyllid Cacopsylla pruni, prompted us to investigate the presence of psyllids infected by ESFYP, as well as other potential vectors and alternative hosts, in various orchards in these provinces. The molecular diagnostic method used (PCR-ELISA) made it possible to detect several C. pruni psyllids infected by ESFYP in this area, but no important secondary vectors were found in the peach orchards. Molecular tests were also made on wild plants surrounding the orchards, leading to ESFYP identification in wild Prunus alone. INTRODUCTION In Europe, several syndromes caused by European Stone Fruit Yellow Phytoplasma (ESFYP), a member of the Apple Proliferation (AP) group (Lee et al, 1998; Seemüller et al., 1998) have been described in stone fruit species. This pathogen can be spread naturally by the psyllid Cacopsylla pruni Scopoli (Carraro et al., 2001). Prior to 1995, ESFYP was only sporadically reported in peach tree orchards, but recent studies have indicated a spreading of this syndrome in Northern Italy. In the orchards inspected, 1-4% of trees were affected, most of which grafted on cv. G.F. 677 (Poggi Pollini et al., 2001a). This article reports further investigation of ESFYP epidemiology to evaluate the possible existence of alternative hosts or other potential vectors. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the two year period 2000-2002, to obtain greater information about the spreading of ESFYP in peach orchards, leafhoppers and psyllids were captured in the Forlì-Cesena, Ravenna, Rimini and Verona provinces. The insects were captured using the “frappage” method or chromotropic traps placed on cultivated and wild stone fruit trees (Table 1), and, during the winter, on conifers and other wild plants surrounding the areas where an increase had been noted in the disease in recent years (Table 2). Tests were also made on other wild rosaceous plants (Prunus cerasifera, P. mahaleb, P. spinosa, Rosa canina, Rubus fruticosus), generally asymptomatic or showing off-season growth in winter, in the vicinity of the affected orchards. Several common wild plants (Celtis australis, Cornus sanguinea, Corylus avellana, Cupressus leylandii, Proc. XIXth IS on Fruit Tree Virus Diseases Ed. G. Llácer Acta Hort 657, ISHS 2004. 514 Fraxinus excelsior, Laurus nobilis) were also analysed for the presence of ESFYP or other phytoplasmas. Previous reports indicated that some were ESFYP-hosts (Jarausch et al., 2001a). Out of 20 C. australis trees, 8 showed leaf chlorosis and 8 leaf roll. All the C. sanguinea shrubs exhibited leaf reddening; the other species were symptomless. Total DNA was extracted from groups of insects (2-5), after classification, or from individual plants according to a phytoplasma enrichment procedure (Marzachì et al., 1999). ESFYP was identified with immunoenzymatic detection of PCR products (PCRELISA), using primer pair fOI/rOI and an ESFYP-specific probe as described previously (Poggi Pollini et al., 2001a). PCR products, initially amplified with universal ribosomal primer pair R16F2/R2, were diluted to 1:40 and 2 µl aliquots were used as templates in nested-PCR reactions primed by one of the group-specific primer pairs (I, III, V, X) (Lee et al., 1995) to evaluate the presence of other phytoplasmas alone or in association with ESFYP. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results obtained showed that numerous groups of C. pruni, captured in all provinces on different stone fruit trees (P. cerasifera, P. persica and P. spinosa) were infected by ESFYP. Other psyllids, one from each group of Bactericera curvatinervis, Laurotrioza alacris and Trioza urticae, were also found to be infected by ESFYP. In the winter traps placed on conifers, only one group of C. pyrisuga (Forster), captured on C. leylandii in the Verona province in 2002, was positive for ESFYP. Out of the numerous leafhoppers tested, there were only two positive groups of Macrosteles cristatus (Ribaut), collected from peach trees in the summer of 2000 in the Verona province (Table 3). Further tests on these leafhoppers in subsequent years did not however confirm these results. The occasional finding of ESFYP in leafhoppers has already been reported (Jarausch et al., 2001b). The results obtained indicate that PCR-ELISA is reliable and can also be used for specific detection of ESFYP in insects, as previously demonstrated for AP and pear decline (PD) phytoplasmas in its vectors. Furthermore, it offers a greater sensitivity than gel electrophoresis (Poggi Pollini et al., 2001b). No phytoplasmas belonging to other groups (I, III, V) or other phytoplasmas of the same AP-group (X) were detected in the insects examined. As regards the wild plants examined, various P. cerasifera and P. spinosa trees and occasionally other wild Prunus were found to be infected, although most were asymptomatic. The largest number of infected psyllids were captured precisely on these trees (Table 4 and 5). No phytoplasmas were found, even using nested-PCR, in the other plants with suspicious phytoplasma symptoms or in symptomless plants. It can be concluded that individual infected C. pruni were present in the peach orchards of all the provinces examined. At present the intensive testing of insects suggests there is no important secondary vector of ESFYP in peach orchards in Northern Italy; however the role of other psyllids in ESFYP transmission will be evaluated. As regards the wild plants surrounding the peach orchards, only wild Prunus were found to be infected by ESFYP. The possible role of additional plant hosts in the spread of the disease, as suggested in France (Jarausch et al, 2001a), was not confirmed by our research, since all the methods used failed to detect ESFYP in these species. Wild Prunus around the peach orchards certainly play a role in the epidemiology of the disease. As already indicated in the past, they represent good hosts for ESFYP, without showing symptoms, as well as for the insect vector (Carraro et al., 2001; Jarausch et al., 2001b). This indicates the importance of including these plants in a control program to eliminate the vector psyllid.
