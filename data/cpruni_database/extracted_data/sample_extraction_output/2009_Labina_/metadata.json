S. Labinaa and T. G. Evdogarovab  aZoological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, 199034 Russia  bInstitute of Biological Problems of Cryolithic Zone, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Yakutsk, Russia  Received March 31, 2009  Abstract\u2014The psyllid fauna of the relict steppes of Central Yakutia is studied for the first time. Among the six  species examined, two are new for Yakutia.  DOI: 10.1134/S0013873809090073  The relict steppes are unique as a type of extrazonal  vegetation, widely distributed in the territory of   Yakutia as early as in the Pleistocene. At present, the  largest pieces of steppe vegetation are preserved in the  middle stream of the Lena River and in the basins of  the rivers Yana and Indigirka (Ivanova and Perfil\u2019eva,  1972).  Psyllids are one of the less studied insects in the Si- berian fauna: until now, there has been no publication  on the composition of the psyllid fauna of the region  as the whole or of its isolated natural areas. The only  exception is the paper on psyllids of the Republic of  Altai by Labina (2008).  Previously, 38 species of psyllids were recorded  from Yakutia in different publications. The first data  on psyllids appeared in papers by Loginova (1961,  1963), dealing with the revision of the genera  Aphalara F\u00f6rster, 1848 and Craspedolepta Enderlein,  1921 (Loginova, 1961, 1963), in the review on psyllids  associated with Salix (Loginova, 1967), and also in  publications where new psyllid species were described  (Loginova 1962a, 1966). Several species were re- corded from Yakutia in the faunal lists of other re- gions: Leningrad Province (Loginova, 1962b) and the  Caucasus (Loginova, 1968). In total, 17 species were  mentioned from Yakutia by M. Loginova, including   4 described from the material collected in the territory  of the republic, with two of them, Aphalara sibirica  Loginova, 1962 and Cacopsylla sibirica (Loginova,  1966) being endemics to the area. Later on, Kli- maszewski (1983) presented data on 10 psyllid species  from Yakutia; 9 of them were recorded from this terri- tory for the first time. In the later joint publication  (Drohojowaska and Klimaszewski, 2006), one more  species endemic to Yakutia, Psylla kotejai Droho- jowaska et Klimaszewski, 2006 was described.  Despite the fact that psyllid fauna of Yakutia is  rather well studied as compared to other Siberian re- gions, currently available data are far from being com- plete, which is particularly confirmed by the present  study.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  The invertebrate fauna of relict steppe communities  on the bedrock bank of the Lena River was studied in  the summer of 2007. The present publication is based  on material collected in model plots by A. Bagacha- nova and Yu. Ermakova, researchers of the Laboratory  of Systematics and Ecology of Invertebrates, Institute  of Biological Problems of the Cryolithic Zone, Sibe- rian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences. Insects  were collected by sweeping with a standard entomo- logical net; material was kept in alcohol. A total of  126 psyllids was examined.  Up till now, there were no data on psyllid fauna of  relict steppes in Central Yakutia. In the present work,  six species belonging to the families Psyllidae and  Triozidae are noted, with two of them, Bactericera  curvatinervis (F\u00f6rster, 1848) and B. rossica (Horv\u00e1th,  1901) (Triozidae), not recorded from Yakutia earlier.

This species was collected  by us in the piedmont of the steppe slope from grasses.  However, the habitats of the species are rather diverse  within its distribution range spreading from forest  tundra to steppes: it was recorded from forests, out- skirts, river banks, forest and flood-plain meadows,  slopes with shrub thickets, edges of flowing marshes,  and waysides.
