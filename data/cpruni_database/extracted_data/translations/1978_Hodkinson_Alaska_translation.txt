The psyllids (Homoptera: Psylloidea) of Alaska

I, D. HODKINSON Department of Biology, Liverpool Polytechnic

ABSTRACT. A key is provided for the identification of the thirty-eight psyllid
species recorded from Alaska. Additional notes on host plant and distribution are
given for each species. The species are: Aphalara manitobaensis Cald., A.nigra Cald.,
Cvaspedolepta alaskensis (Ash. ), Cnebulosa (Zett.) ssp. kincaidi (Ash. ), C.
schwarzi (Ash. ), C.subpunctata (Forster), Psylla alaskensis Ash., P.betulaenanae
Oss., P.breviata Patch, P.fibulata Crawf., P.floccosa Patch, P.galeaformis Patch,
P.haliaeeti sp.nov., P.hamata Tuthill, P.highwoodensis sp.nov., P.jenseni sp.nov.,
P.kananaskensis Hod., P.ledi Flor., P.longiforceps sp.nov., P.minor Crawf., P.
macleani sp.nov., P.myrtilli Wag. ssp. canadensis Hod., P.palmeni Low, P.
phlebophyllae sp.nov., P.rara Tuthill, P.rufipennis sp.nov., P.sinuata Crawf.,
Pstriata Patch, P.stricklandi Crawf., P.toolikensis sp.nov., P.zaecevi Sule, Trioza
albifrons Crawf., Trioza artica sp.nov., T.atkasookensis sp.nov., T.incerta Tuthill,
T.salicivora Reut. (= T.maura auctt. N.Amer. ), T.stylifera Patch, Trioza sp.nov. (undescribed). All the newly described species were collected on Salix. The Alaskan fauna is made up of four major components: 1, true Arctic
species; 2, Arctic/subarctic species; 3, subarctic/alpine species; 4, northern
forest zone species. Eight of the Alaskan psyllids exhibit an holarctic distribution
and there is a strong faunal affinity with similar areas in northern Scandinavia:
the same four genera recur throughout the northern holarctic. There is strong
circumstantial evidence that certain psyllid species are parthogenetic over part
of their range, particularly in arctic/alpine situations. Introduction

Alaska stands at the cross-roads between the
Palaearctic and Nearctic zoogeographical
regions, Recent evidence suggests that the
Beringia land bridge provided a corridor for
significant faunal migration between the
two regions (Hopkins, 1967). Hence studies
on the Alaskan fauna are likely to provide
strong circumstantial evidence of such past
migrations. Prior to this study the Alaskan psyllid
fauna, and that of the North American

ment of Biology, Liverpool Polytechnic, Byrom
Street, Liverpool L3 3AF. arctic/subarctic in general, was very poorly
known, Ashmead (1904) described four new
species from Alaska, Psylla alaskensis, Apha-
lara schwarzi, Aphalara kincaidi and Aphalara
alaskensis. The latter three species were
transferred to the genus Craspedolepta by
Russell (1973) and C.kincaidi is now recog-
nized as a sub-species of the palaearctic C.
nebulosa. Crawford (1914), in his monograph on the
American psyllids, redescribed Ashmead’s
species but failed to add to the faunal list. Tuthill (1943) added Trioza incerta, T.
albifrons and T.maura to the Alaskan fauna
and Weber (1950) added Psylla sinuata. Jensen (1951) and Weber (1950) provide

additional localities for known species, while
both Weber (1950) and Robinson (1953)
almost certainly mention species which are
described as new in this paper. The present paper reflects intensive col-
lecting in four main areas: the North Slope,
the Fairbanks region, the Mount McKinley
National Park and along the Trans-Alaska
pipeline southwards from Prudhoe Bay
through the Brooks Range to just south of the
Yukon River. In addition I have also examined,
through courtesy of the U.S. National Museum,
Washington (USNM), a long series of mainly
southern Alaskan psyllids collected as part
of the Alaska Insects Project by Dr R. I.
Sailer and co-workers. Altogether thirty-
eight species of psyllid are now recorded for
the region, ten of which are new to science. The holotypes of most of these species are
deposited in the British Museum (Natural
History) (BMNH). Nomenclature of host plants follows
Hultén (1968) and the initials (AP) are used
throughout to indicate localities on the
Alaska pipeline route, with the figure following
indicating distance in miles N (+) or S (—) of
the Yukon River crossing. Full locality data
is too extensive to be included for the
commoner species but is available in mimeo-
graph form from the author. The only other psyllid species recorded
from the American arctic are Psylla arctica
(Walker), described from Albany River,
Hudson’s Bay, and Aphalara nigra and A.
manitobaensis, described from Churchill,
Manitoba. Psylla arctica appears to be a Salix-
feeding species but the three female types
deposited in the British Museum are in-
separable from other Salix-feeding species
and in the absence of males P.arctica must
be regarded as a nomen dubium. Both A.nigra
and A.manitobaensis occur in Alaska. Klimaszewski (1975) split the genus Psylla
as presently conceived into Psylla sensu
stricto and Cacopsylla Ossiannilsson, a pre-
viously recognized subgenus. This division
does not appear to hold on a world basis and
has not been followed here. However, all
the new Psylla species described in this paper
fall within the subgenus Cacopsylla. The thirty-eight species recorded from
Alaska represent a fairly complete list of the
total species present in all genera except
Trioza. Intensive collecting in Southern

Alaska would probably increase the number
of representatives of this genus. The Alaskan psyllid fauna contains a large
holarctic element which has not previously
been recognized. All the eight species in-
volved are associated with plants having an

established holarctic distribution. In wet
tundra areas on the North Slope and in

alpine areas such as McKinley Park the psyllid
fauna is almost identical with that of similar
areas in Scandinavia. For instance, Ossian-
nilsson (1975) lists P.palmeni, P. betulaenanae,
P.zaecevi, P.myrtilli and Cnebulosa in the
fauna of the Hardangervidda plateau in
Norway. Furthermore the genera represented in
Alaska are the same four genera that are
found in northern Scandinavia and Siberia and
in alpine regions of North America and
northern Europe (e.g. Lindberg & Ossian-
nilsson, 1960). Four major components can be recognized
in the Alaskan psyllid fauna (Table 1). 1, True arctic insects found only on the
tundra regions of the Arctic Slope. 2. Arctic/subarctic species which do not
generally extend far onto the Arctic Slope but
which probably reach their southern limit in
Alaska or equivalent latitudes. 3. Sub-arctic/alpine species which reach
their northern limit in Alaska but which
extend down the mountain chains of western
Canada and the lower U.S.A.

4. Species associated with the northern
forest zone, found right across North America,
also extending south along the major mountain
chains. A fifth category of species with unknown
distributions has been added for completeness. The opening of the trans-Alaska pipeline
provided a unique opportunity for the study of
the distribution of psyllids (and other insects)
relative to their host plants along a north—
south transect across the Arctic Slope through
the Brooks Range into the boreal forest zone. While results of the full insect survey will be
discussed elsewhere a preliminary observation
on the psyllids is of interest. In several species such as Psylla betu-
laenanae, P.galeaformis, P.ledi and P.myrtilli
the host plant appears to extend further
north than the psyllid, suggesting that climate
and not host plant availability is limiting
the distribution of these species. 335

The Alaskan Salix-feeding Psylla are
particularly diverse and individual species
often occur at extremely high densities. Many
species are catkin feeders as nymphs and for
Psylla palmeni, feeding on Salix pulchra in
northern Alaska, densities of over 200 nymphs
per catkin were recorded. This represents an
average weight of 1g of psyllid for every
90 g of catkin! For a long time it has been thought that
P.myrtilli in Europe was parthenogenetic asno
males had ever been taken, even in very large
collections (Linnavuori, 1951; Lauterer, 1963). However, occasional males have been taken
in Russia and China (Kuwayama & Miyatake,
1971; Ossiannilsson, 1975), and Hodkinson
(1976) described a sexual sub-species from
Canada. Similarly a number of Alaskan species
were collected in large numbers only as
females despite intensive searches for males. These included Psylla myrtilli, P.ledi and
P.rara, In addition I observed a colony of
Psylla rara in the Kananaskis Valley, Alberta,
Canada, over a 1 year period and never found a
single male. Similarly a colony of Trioza
pletschi Tuthill on Highwood Pass Summit,
Alberta, yielded no males. The males of all
these species have been found at lower alti-
tudes or latitudes,

A possible alternative explanation of this
phenomenon is that after mating males die
leaving the females to oviposit. However
Burts & Fischer (1967) showed that in Psylla
pyricola Férster repeated mating is necessary
for a female to produce a full egg complement,
and in most psyllids males are almost as long-
lived as females. I suggest, therefore, that there is strong
circumstantial evidence that certain psyllids
may be facultatively parthenogenetic under
more severe climatic regimes, and as one
moves into alpine/tundra regions, such as
Alaska, the incidence of parthenogenesis
increases. This is a subject worthy of further
investigation. Keys to the Alaskan psyllids

Psylla haliaeeti is a very distinct species
which can be separated from all known
Psylla species by the following combination of
characters: the distribution of the forewing
spinules, the presence of grey clouds in the
forewing, the form of the male genitalia and
the upturned apex to the female proctiger. 342 I. D. Hodkinson

Psylla macleani is close to Psylla propinqua
Schaefer, Psylla subpropinqua Loginova and
Psyllamoscovita Andrianova, a group of
closely related palaearctic species which feed
on Salix (vide Loginova, 1967). Together they
form a particularly difficult group in which

the species can only be reliably separated on
the form of the male parameres. Psylla
macleani has no close North American relative. Psylla jenseni sp.nov. Head (Fig. 20) as broad as thorax; vertex

Psylla highwoodensis is close to P.jenseni
and P.kananaskensis Hodkinson, and these
three species form a distinct group which is
characterized by the absence of surface
spinules from the forewing membrane. They
can be easily separated on the form of the male
parameres, which nevertheless have a common
basic form. The specific differences, however,
remain constant over a wide geographical
area. Psylla phlebophyliae sp.nov. Head (Fig. 39) as broad as thorax, vertex

Psylla longiforceps belongs to the Psylla
americana Crawford/Psylla curta Crawford
complex (vide Jensen, 1951). It can be
separated from these species on the length
of the male paramere, the form of the para-
mere apex, and the presence of dense spinules
in the basal half of the forewing. Psylla alaskensis Ashmead

Trioza atkasookensis is closest to T.
arctica Hod. The two species can be separated
by the shorter wings and antennae in T.
atkasookensis, the shape of the male proctiger,
paramere and penis, and the shape of the
female proctiger. The two species appear
closest to Trioza versicolor Léw_ sensu
Dobreanu & Manolache 1962, a Salix-feeding
species from Romania, but can be separated
on the male genitalia. Among North American
species T.arctica and T.atkasookensis are
closest to T.incerta Tuthill, T.varians Crawf. and T.salicivora Reut. The species can be
separated on the shape of the male para-
meres and by the presence of wing spinules
in T.salicivora. The male genitalia of T.
incerta and T.salicivora which occur in Alaska
are illustrated for comparison (Figs. 91—94). Trioza albifrons Crawford

Frequently encountered on Salix spp. especially S.depressa subsp. rostrata at several
localities in southern and central Alaska;
extends southwards down the western
mountains through Canada to Colorado. Trioza salicivora Reuter

This species has previously been recorded
from North America under the name Trioza
maura Forster. Crawford introduced this
species into the North American list without
examining specimens of maura and using
Sulc’s illustrations for comparison. I have
now compared a long series of North American
material from Alaska, Canada, Utah and New
Mexico with European material of T.salicivora
from England and Scandinavia, including a
female Reuter type deposited in the British
Museum. These North American specimens,
identified as maura, are the same species as
salicivora, the only difference being that the
female proctiger is fractionally longer in
North American material. This species is
widespread on Salix spp., particularly S.

depressa subsp. rostrata, throughout southern
and central Alaska. Widely distributed across
Canada and the northern U.S.A.

Trioza stylifera Patch

A rare and little-known species. 1 ¢ Eagle
River Flats, Anchorage, 9.iv.48 (K. Sommer-
man), 1% Otter Lake Marsh Anchorage,
18.v.48 (R. I. Sailer). Previously recorded
from New Hampshire, U.S.A., and Manitoba
and Ontario, Canada. Host plant unknown. The male genitalia of this species which are
inadequately illustrated by Tuthill (1943) are
shown in Fig. 95. Trioza sp.nov. One female of an undoubtedly new species
collected at Toolik Lake (AP +236), 15.viii.76,
