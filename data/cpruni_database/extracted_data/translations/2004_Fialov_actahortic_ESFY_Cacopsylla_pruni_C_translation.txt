Abstract

Apricot chlorotic leaf roll (ACLR), associated with European stone fruit
yellows (ESFY) phytoplasma, is one of the most important decline diseases of
apricots in southern and central Europe. The paper surveys results of ESFY
phytoplasma studies carried out during the period 1993-2003 in the Czech Republic. The special emphasis was devoted to apricots (Prunus armeniaca) as the most
frequent and economically important host species of the phytoplasma. All of main
apricot cultivars grown in the Czech Republic were found infected with ESFY
phytoplasma. The ESFY phytoplasma was also identified in other hosts: Prunus
persica, P. domestica, P. salicina x cerasifera, P. amygdalus x cerasifera, P. spinosa,
Cerasus avium, and C. vulgaris. Psyllid Cacopsylla pruni was confirmed as a vector of
ESFY phytoplasma. It was demonstrated that C. pruni is able to accomplish the
regular development on three species of host plants: Prunus armeniaca, P. persica,
and P. spinosa. INTRODUCTION

Apricot chlorotic leaf roll - ACLR (Morvan, 1977), associated with European
stone fruit yellows (ESFY) phytoplasma (Lorenz et al., 1995), is one of the most serious
important decline diseases of apricots in southern and central Europe, including the Czech
Republic. Leaf yellowing and roll, sparse foliage, and decline are considered as
characteristic symptoms of the disease. Recently, a new period of the disease study has
been started with identifying of ESFY phytoplasma specific vector psylla Cacopsylla
pruni in Italy (Carraro et al., 1998). Subsequently, few studies concerning with
epidemiological aspects of ESFY were conducted in France (Jarausch et al., 1998, 2001a,
b) and in Italy (Carraro et al., 2001). An occurrence of apricot and other Prunus trees showing symptoms attributable to
phytoplasmas in the Czech Republic indicates that the disease may became a problem in
our fruit tree growing areas (Blattny, 1977; Navratil et al., 1998). The aim of the work
was to contribute to a knowledge of the disease status in the Czech Republic studying: the
ESFY phytoplasma host range with attention to cultured Prunus species, occurrence and
population dynamics of potential phytoplasma vectors, with main emphasis to phenology
and natural infectivity of Cacopsylla pruni. Proc. XIX" IS on Fruit Tree Virus Diseases 483

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Plants

To identify incidence and plant host range of ESFY phytoplasma visual symptom
observations were conducted in apricot and peach orchards, experimental plantations, and
private gardens in growing area of south Moravia (Czech Republic) between 1996 and
2002. Twigs from stone fruit trees (Prunus armeniaca, P. persica, P. domestica, P.
spinosa, P. salicina x cerasifera, P. amygdalus x cerasifera, Cerasus avium, and C.
vulgaris) exhibiting yellows, leaf rolling or decline symptoms and from non-symptomatic
ones were cut for phytoplasma tests during the vegetative seasons. Insects

The catching of psyllids was carried out from March to May between 2000 and
2003 in three localities of south Moravia: Lednice (an experimental plantation with
apricot and peach trees), Velké Bilovice (a commercial apricot orchard with Prunus
spinosa and Crataegus sp. in a neighbourhood), and Bulhary (P. spinosa at the edge of
the forest complex, 15 km far from the nearest apricot orchard). Population density was
estimated as frequency of individuals caught on 50 branches using limb-jarring Steiner. Adults of Cacopsylla pruni were subjected to phytoplasma detection. To study the
development of C. pruni, adults captured in nature were introduced into isolators on
branches of P. armeniaca, P. spinosa, and P. persica. In a case, adults of the species
caught in Lednice locality in 2002 were reared in the isolator on an ESFY positive apricot
branch. Detection and Identification of Phytoplasmas

The total plant DNA was extracted from axial phloem preparations using the
phytoplasma enrichment procedure according to Ahrens and Seemiiller (1992). The DNA
extracts from individuals of C. pruni were obtained using commercial kit (Wizard
Genomic DNA Purification Kit, Promega, USA). DNA extracts from both plants and insects were subjected to PCR analysis with
phytoplasma universal primer pairs derived from 16S rRNA gene. Nested-PCR assays
were performed with primer pair R16F1/RO, RI6F2/R2 (Lee et al., 1995), and fU5/rU3
(Lorenz et al., 1995). DNA preparations from plants of Vinca rosea infected with AT
isolate of apple proliferation phytoplasma served as a positive control. Tubes with
reaction mixture devoid of DNA templates were included as a negative control. PCR
products were analysed by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with
ethidium bromide and visualized with an UV transilluminator. Identification of phytoplasmas was carried out by RFLP analyses of R16F2/R2
amplimers. Fifteen 11 of the products were digested separately with Rsal, Bfml, and Alul
(Fermentas, Lithuania) restriction endonucleases according to the instruction of the
manufacturer. The restriction products were separated by electrophoresis through 3%
MetaPhor agarose (FMC, USA) gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with
an UV transilluminator. Sequencing

PCR products covering P1/P7 (Schneider et al., 1995) segment of 16S rRNA gene
from an apricot (ESFY-CZ isolate) were sequenced on automated DNA ABI PRISM 310
sequencer (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, Lincoln, USA). Sequence data were read
and analysed by DNASTAR programme package (Lasergene, USA). Multiple sequence
alignment was performed using the www service ClustalW (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp)
and tree was drawn with the TreeView 1.6.6 software. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

PCR detection confirmed the presence of ESFY phytoplasma in all tested stone
fruit species from monitored growing area. From an economical point of view, apricots

484

were of the main interest in the testing. All of main apricot cultivars grown in the Czech
Republic (‘Velkopavlovicka’, ‘Bergeron’, ‘Mad’arska’, ‘Karola’, ‘Veecot’) were found
affected with the phytoplasma. However, the proportion of infected apricot trees per
analysed plots varied from 0 to 35% (rarely reached 82%). Samples from apricot trees
with typical ACLR symptoms usually gave positive reaction. In addition, positive tests
were obtained in samples from trees without visual symptoms in all mentioned cultivars. It is noteworthy that phytoplasma affected apricot trees with strong symptoms do not
usually live more than one year. The situation of the relatively high level of ESFY
phytoplasma infection within apricots seems to be similar to this in other European
countries as in France (Jarausch et al., 1998, 2001a) or in Austria (Richter, 2002). Peach trees (‘Redhaven’, ‘Cresthaven’, ‘Fairhaven’) were found less affected by
the ESFY phytoplasma, when proportion of infested trees in plots varied from 0 to 12%. A sequence of a representative phytoplasma isolate from an apricot tree showing
typical symptoms of ACLR was deposited in the GenBank database under accession
number Y11933. The dendrogram (Fig. 1) shows the phylogenetic position of the isolate
(ESFY-CZ) within the apple proliferation phytoplasma group (16SrX). The detailed
sequence comparison revealed the close relationship with the ESFY phytoplasma
(X68374) isolated from peach tree in Germany and ’Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’
(AY029540). Cacopsylla pruni and C. melanoneura were dominant psyllid species in the
localities pursued during the monitoring of potential vectors of phytoplasma. Cacopsylla
pyrisuga, C. saliceti, C. crataegi, C. affinis, Stictocephala bisonia, Allygus mixtus, and
Dictyophara europea were sporadically found. No individual of Fieberiella sp. was
recorded. Data concerning with population dynamics of C. pruni are given in Table 1. Population density of the species can be considered high in the area studied in spite of
differences among localities. Phenological aspects of C. pruni in the area were followed. The species has one
generation per year. The over-wintering adults occur from the half of March till the
beginning of June on apricots, rarely on peaches. In March-April period adults suck and
from the beginning of May they lay eggs during three-four next weeks. Larvae occur from
May till the half of June, when the adults of new generation appear. They pass
aestivation, following by hibernation. Cacopsylla pruni prefers black thorn (Prunus spinosa) for its development. It
migrates from apricot orchards to reach the host during April. A smaller part of over-
wintering generation of C. pruni remains within orchard, where the laying eggs and the
development of the new generation run. During summer the adults of C. pruni colonize
conifers to over-winter. Preliminary observations indicate that another plant host on
which they can over-winter probably exists. We proved experimentally that C. pruni is
able to develop on three species of host plants: black thorn - the most important one,
apricot tree, and peach tree. Results of phytoplasma detection and identification in C. pruni adults captured
from south Moravia sites during season of 2002 are surveyed in Table 2. The presence of
ESFY phytoplasma was proved in individuals from all localities. Moreover, some adults
were found to carry phytoplasmas belonging to the Aster yellows group. Two C. pruni
individuals from Velké Bilovice locality were positive for the presence of apple
proliferation phytoplasma. However, no case of mixed infection was found out. In adults of new generation of C. pruni that developed on ESFY positive apricot
tree high incidence (93%) of ESFY phytolasma positive individuals was found out
compared to 13% infectivity determined in the natural population introduced into the
isolator. ESFY infected individuals of the species were identified in samples captured on
apricots and black thorns. Simultaneously, black thorn was detected as symptom-less
carrier of the phytoplasma in the study. Black thorn seems be important for a persistence
and spread of the ESFY phytoplasma in the Czech Republic. Likewise, a role of wild

485

Prunus species in epidemiology of ESFY and other phytoplasmas was demonstrated by
Jarausch et al. (2001a). In view of the economical importance of ACLR, further investigations concerning
epidemiological aspects of the disease are necessary to conduct including control of wild
phytoplasma resources in the vicinity of orchards and monitoring of an occurrence and an
activity of vectors. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
