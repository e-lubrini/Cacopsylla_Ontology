Abstract 

Phytoplasmas belonging to the ribosomal subgroup 16SrIII-A (X disease and related phytoplasmas) were identified in two plants 
of declining cherry during the monitoring of two experimental plum orchards. The same phytoplasmas were identified also in Phi-
laenus spumarius samples collected in yellow sticky traps located inside the plum orchards. ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ 
was detected in one declining cherry plant and in samples of Fieberiella florii. Among the insect species tested for phytoplasma 
presence Cacopsylla pruni was only captured once, and the sample resulted negative to the molecular tests. 

Key words: Cherry decline, PCR/RFLP analyses, insects, epidemiology. 

Introduction 

Vignola  is  one  of  the  most  important  plum  and  cherry 
growing areas in northern Italy. From the early thirties 
a  disease  called  “leptonecrosis”  affecting  plum,  cherry 
and apricot (Goidanich, 1933; 1934) was reported in the 
area. This disease now named European stone fruit yel-
lows  (ESFY)  is  associated  with  ‘Candidatus  Phyto-
plasma  prunorum’  (Seemüller  and  Schneider,  2004). 
Severe outbreaks were observed over the years, mainly 
after  Japanese  plum  varieties  were  introduced  into  the 
area.  Recently,  two  experimental  plum  orchards  where 
tolerance/resistance  to  ESFY  phytoplasma  is  studied 
were  monitored.  Surveys  were  extended  to  verify  phy-
toplasma presence also in cherry plants growing nearby. 
Symptomatic cherry plants, about 10 year’s old, showed 
poor vegetation, reduced leaf size, upward curled leaves 
with  discolorations ranging from  yellow  to  red.  Insects 
collected  on  yellow  sticky  traps  located  in  the  experi-
mental plum orchards were also tested in order to verify 
phytoplasma presence in the environment. 

Materials and methods 

Leaf and small branch samples were collected from six 
cherry plants (3 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic) near 
the  experimental  plum  fields.  A  total  of  12  samples 
were employed for nucleic acid extraction using a chlo-
roform/phenol method (Prince et al., 1993). 

During  2005-2006  insect  monitoring  was  carried  out 
from March to the end of July with yellow sticky traps 
randomly  distributed  in  the  two  experimental  plum  or-
chards. Insects collected from traps were maintained in 
alcohol 100% at 4 °C for classification; nucleic acid ex-
traction  from  interesting  species  was  then  carried  out 
with  a  rapid  CTAB-based  procedure  (Angelini  et  al., 
2001) on batches of 3 insects per species. 

Direct PCR with P1/P7 primer pair (Deng and Hiruki, 
1991;  Schneider  et  al.,  1995)  and  nested  amplification 
with  primers  R16F2/R2  and/or  R16(X)F1/R1  (Lee  et 

al., 1995) were performed on both plant and insect sam-
ples following a described protocol (Schaff et al., 1992). 
Reference  phytoplasma  strains  were  employed  as  posi-
tive  controls.  Amplicons  obtained  with  R16F2/R2  and 
R16(X)F1/R1  primer  pairs  were  subjected  to  RFLP 
analyses with TruI, RsaI and SspI restriction enzymes to 
verify phytoplasma identity. 

Results and discussion 

Only  samples  from  both  phloem  and  leaf  midribs  of 
symptomatic  cherry  plants  gave  positive  results  in 
nested PCR amplifications. RFLP analyses indicate the 
presence of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in one of the trees and of 
phytoplasmas belonging to ribosomal subgroup 16SrIII-
A in the other two symptomatic cherry plants (figure 1). 
Several potentially phytoplasma vectors were captured 
in  yellow  sticky  traps  (table  1).  Cacopsylla  pruni  Sco-
poli, vector of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ (Carraro et al., 1998) 
was  only  captured  once  and  was  negative  to  molecular 
tests.  Nested  PCR  amplification  detected  phytoplasma 
presence in 4 out of the 6 species tested. RFLP analyses 
with  TruI  showed  restriction  profiles  of  phytoplasmas 
related  to  ribosomal  group  16SrV  (Elm  yellows)  in 
Anoplotettix spp. and Metcalfa pruinosa Say. Ribosomal 
group  16SrX  (Apple  proliferation)  and  subgroup 
16SrIII-A (Peach X disease) were respectively detected 
in  Fieberiella  florii  (Stål)  and  Philaenus  spumarius  L.. 
Further  RFLP  analyses  on  R16(X)F1/R1  amplicons 
from  F.  florii  with  RsaI  and  SspI  restriction  enzymes 
allowed the identification of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ (table 1). 
The finding of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in cherry trees indi-
cates  an  epidemic  inside  and  around  the  experimental 
plum  orchards.  These  phytoplasmas  were  detected  also 
in a number of plum plants under evaluation for ESFY 
resistance/tolerance.

The finding of 16SrIII-A phytoplasmas in two declin-
ing cherry trees represent the first evidence of this phy-
toplasma presence in cherry in Italy. Previous reports of 
16SrIII phytoplasmas in cherry only refers to ribosomal

subgroup  16SrIII-B  phytoplasmas  (Paltrinieri  et  al.,
2001;  2007).  The  same  phytoplasmas  were  identified 
in  P.  spumarius  from  yellow  sticky  traps  confirming 
presence  of  this  phytoplasma  in  the  environment. 
However,  the  role  of  this  insect  as  possible  phyto-
plasma  vector  is  under  investigation  in  several  differ-
ent environments. 

The  scarcity  of  captures  of  C.  pruni  and  the  contem-
poreneous  identification  of  ‘Ca.  P.  prunorum’  in  F. 
florii represent a finding that deserves extensive further 
investigations.  It  is  necessary  to  reevaluate  the  insect 
vector pattern of ESFY especially in southern European 
stone  fruit  cultivation  areas  and  in  the  warmest  Euro-
pean regions.
