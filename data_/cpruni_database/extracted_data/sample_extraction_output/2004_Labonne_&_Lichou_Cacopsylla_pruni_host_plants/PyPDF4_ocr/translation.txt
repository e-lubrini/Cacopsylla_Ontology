C. pruni was collected on Prunus plants by beating trays. The insect was found in every prospected area. The reimmigrants (adults that have overwintered) were found on Prunus from February to May and the new generation from May to June. Not any C. pruni was found on Prunus after July. Prunus spinosa appeared the preferred host plant compared to the other monitored Prunus . The data are discussed in relation to the control of the phytoplasma disease. INTRODUCTION European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) is a disease of increasing importance in France in apricot and Japanese plum orchards. The causal agent is a phytoplasma. After the discovery of Cacopsylla pruni as vector of ESFY (Carraro et al., 1998), it appears that there were very few data on the distribution and life cycle of this insect in France. Only 2 publications reported the species in France (Lambertie, 1910 ; Malenovsky, 1999). Thus a network joining several French research and/or development institutes was established. Its general objective was to produce data which can be a basis to propose a pest management strategy against the insect in order to stop or to decrease the incidence of the disease. The first objectives of the network were 1) to confirm the presence of C. pruni in the different geographic areas where the ESFY had been detected , 2) to make clear the periods of presence of C. pruni on Prunus plants and 3) to determine the prefered host plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS The network and the location of the collecting sites Several people of different institutes ( see acknowledgments) joined together to obtain a coverage of the most important stone fruit production areas in France (fig 1). The seasonal evolution of the abundance of C. pruni was recorded at each location by regular sampling on host plants (one sample per week during the period from January to July ; one sample per two weeks during the remaining period) during 3 successive years (2000 2002). Several Prunus species were sampled with at least one sample taken from Prunus spinosa to be able to compare the data between locations. Standardised protocol to count C. pruni : As many different people were implied in the project, the data had to be collected with a same and simple protocol to be compared. The sample unit was defined as a serie of 20 branches beaten upon a 0.5 m_ beating tray. The C. pruni falling on the tray were Proc. XIXth IS on Fruit Tree Virus Diseases, G. Llàcer (eds), Acta Hort. 657, ISHS 2004, p 465-470 directly counted or collected with a mouth aspirator to confirm later their identity under a stereomicroscope. Host plants monitored Depending on the area, several of the following Prunus species were sampled : P. armeniaca , P. cerasifera , P. domestica , P. salicina , P. spinosa. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Presence of C. pruni on P. spinosa : Comparison of Locations and Years C. pruni was recorded at each location, which proved that it was present throughout the studied area. The seasonal variations of the abundance of C. pruni followed a general bimodal shape (fig. 2). The first peak of abundance corresponds to the presence of winter forms ( reimmigrants) characterized by their dark color. The second peak, when present, corresponds to the adults of the new generation, characterized by their light color. Thus the data are in agreement with the hypothetical life cycle of C. pruni with one generation per year and an alternation between Prunus as reproduction plant and other plants as overwintering shelters. The arrivals of reimmigrants on Prunus plants were noticed at the end of the winter. They ranged from mid-February on the Mediterranean border to the second part of March in Alsace-Lorraine. The highest population level was reached in March-April and the last reimmigrants diseappeared before the second week of May everywhere. The adults of the new generation were caught on Prunus in May-June. Few variations in the period of presence were observed between the 3 years for a defined place. The differences in abundance are difficult to interpret because the collection with beating trays are subjected to changing environmental factors (wind, rain, ...) From every location, very few insects were recovered from Prunus after the end of June and no one after August. Host Plant Preference The mean numbers of C. pruni ( adults reimmigrants and new generation) caught on each Prunus species was calculated (table 1). The preferred host plants appeared to be P. spinosa , followed by P. cerasifera , P. salicina and P. domestica . While regularly caught on P . armeniaca , few C. pruni were caught on this Prunus species .. Moreover most of them were caught in orchards where P. domestica or P. cerasifera were used as rootstock and provided an abundant sucker production. In some cases nymphs were also monitored (table 2) : fewer nymphs were caught on apricot trees than on P. domestica and P. cerasifera rootstocks or on wild P. spinosa . In the location where C. pruni was monitored on several Prunus species, the populations fluctuated at the same time (table 3) : this suggests that the reimmigrants came at the same time in the orchards and on the wild Prunus and that there is no population differentiation according to the host plant. CONCLUSIONS C. pruni was recorded in all the regions where ESFY is epidemic, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that this insect is the main (and most likely unique) natural vector of this phytoplasma. The wild Prunus species P. spinosa appeared to be its prefered host plant, which is in agreement with the previous entomological records in Proc. XIXth IS on Fruit Tree Virus Diseases, G. Llàcer (eds), Acta Hort. 657, ISHS 2004, p 465-470 different countries (Lauterer, 1999 ; Ossiannillsonn, 1992 ). The facts that the different Prunus species appeared to be colonised at the same time and that the populations of C. pruni are always more abundant on P. spinosa allows to consider P. spinosa as a sentinel species : the monitoring of C. pruni to detected the first activity of the insect could be performed more easily on P. spinosa than in orchards. Adults and nymphs of C. pruni were collected more often on Prunus rootstock than on the apricot varieties themselves. Thus, jointly to the elimination of infected stone fruit trees in the orchards, a careful elimination of suckers from rootstock of P. domestica or P. cerasifera is advised to prevent both colonisation and reproduction of C. pruni in the orchard, and perhaps inoculation of ESFY phytoplasma through the rootstock. If specific phytosanitary treatments have to be applied against C. pruni , they should take into account the biology of the insect : an application before the peak of arrivals could prevent the reproduction of C. pruni in the orchards and might decrease the speed of ESFY epidemics. On the contrary any application later than the month of June will have no effect as at that time the insects are away from the Prunus .
