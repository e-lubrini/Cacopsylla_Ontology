Abstract: The paper lists psyllids (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) found in and around the Ojeéw National Park and discusses
some selected species. Of the 46 confirmed species, representing the families Aphalaridae, Liviidae, Psyllidae and
Triozidae, 44 are reported for the first time from the Ojedw National Park. The largest group of psyllids is constituted
by taxons related to forests and meadow and herbaceous communities. The following species are of particular interest. Craspedoplepta flavipennis (Foerster, 1848), a species characteristic of montane and subalpine altitudes, has its
northern limit in Poland. The boreal-upland Cacopsylla nigrita (Zetterstedt, 1828) and Craspedoplepta malachitica
(Dahlbom, 1851) are considered to be typical steppe species in Poland. Key words: Hemiptera, Psylloidea, jumping plant lice, faunisties, Ojedw National Park

INTRODUCTION

The Ojcow National Park (ONP) is located in the southern part of the Krakow-
Czestochowa Upland in southern Poland about 20 kilometers to the north west of the city of
Cracow (Kondracki 2002, Richling 2006). The Ojcow Park is the smallest of national parks in
Poland, it covers the area of ​​2146 ha extending over two deep-cut karst valleys (Pradnik Valley
and Saspowska Valley) and small parts of the Jurassic plateau (Wisniowski 2003). The karst
processes of the limestone substrate make the morphology of the area highly diversified
(Aleksandrowicz & Aleksandrowicz 2004). The rich relief entails, in turn, the diversification of
the meso- and microclimatic conditions, which results in the richness of habitats. Over 950
species of vascular plants have been found in the Park, composing approximately 40
communities (Medwecka-Kornas 1977, 2006, Medwecka-KornaS & Loster 1995,
Matuszkiewicz J. M. 2001, Matuszkiewicz W. 2001). Over 70% of the area is covered by
woodland, mostly mixed oak-hornbeam forests and beech woods. A smaller is portion covered
by mixed coniferous forests, maple forests, elm riparian forests, meadows and xerothermic
grasslands; the latter two habitats are the richest in plant species. During the long history of faunistic studies in the area of ​​the Ojcéw National Park, which
were initialized in the 19th century, the ordo Hemiptera has been well investigated - 766
species were collected in this area, which constitutes 33% of Polish fauna of Hemiptera
(Boklak & Klasa2016). Data referring to Hemiptera in ONP are included in over 60
publications (Boklak & Klasa2016) but detailed faunistic investigation of Hemiptera have been
conducted only in few papers: Coccoidea (Koteja & Zak-Ogaza 1969), Aphidoidea (Osiadacz
2006, Osiadacz & Wojciechowski 2009), Fulgoromorpha et Cicadomorpha (Szwedo 1992),
Aleyrodoidea (Klasa & Wisniowski 2016) and Heteroptera (Bednarek 1975, Chlond &
Gorezyca 2009). Among all Hemiptera, psyllids have been the only group that has not been studied in the
Ojcow National Park in detail yet (Pawtowski 2008, Boklak & Klasa 2016). Only two species

 

 

28 J. Drohojowska and A. Klasa

of psyllids were mentioned from that area previously (Moesz 1920, Skrzypezyfiska &
Ziemniewicz 2012). Our contribution aims at providing the first list of psyllids of the Ojcow
National Park. Psyllids (Psylloidea) constitute a superfamily of sap sucking phytophages within the
Hemiptera. Currently, the world fauna of psyllids amounts to about 4000 described species
(Percy et al. 2018). In Poland, 113 species have been reported (Drohojowska 2004,
Drohojowska & Glowacka 2011). MATERIAL AND METHODS. The psyllids from the area of ​​the Ojcow National Park (ONP) and the nearest vicinity in
its buffer zone were collected in the years 1990-2017. Only qualitative samples were
collected using an insect net, by shaking and inspecting the host plants. Over 800 specimens
were collected from over 30 locations in the area of ​​the Park and the nearest vicinity in the
Park's buffer zone [UTM: DA16]: Kolonia Kamieniec, Wielmoza over the Dolina Zachwytu,
Murownia hamlet in Biaty KoScidt (segetal communities) and Matesowa Skala in Wola
Kalinowska (Fig. 1). Due to the mobility of psyllids and the small distance between the sites
in the buffer zone and the area of ​​the Park, all species were considered as the fauna of the
ONP. The material was preserved in 70% ethanol or dry or slides mounted. For slide mounting,
the specimens were cleared in a solution of KOH, passed through chloralphenol and chloral
hydrate and mounted in Berlese fluid (Klimaszewski 1969). The material is deposited in the
collection of the Silesian University in Katowice. All collected specimens were identified to species by Jowita Drohojowska, except from
three which were identificated by Daniel Burckhardt. The family classification follows
Burckhardt & Ouvrard (2012) and Burckhardt & Queiroz (2013), the species nomenclature is
according to Ouvrard (2018). The list of species is organized alphabetically using the classification by Burckhardt &
Ouvrard (2012) with additions by Burckhardt & Queiroz (2013). The locations of occurrence
of psyllids were ordered based on the dates of the material collection. Abbreviations used:

The investigation of psyllids fauna in the area of ​​the Ojcéw National Park resulted in
identifying the presence of 46 species of psyllids, out of which 44 had never been recorded
before in the ONP. Two species: Psyllopsis fraxini and Trioza flavipennis had been recorded
earlier by Moesz (1920) and Skrzypezyfska & Ziemniewicz (2012) and presence of these
species could be confirmed. The 46 listed species of psyllids constituting nearly 40% of the
national fauna and representing all the four families that are present in Poland have been found
in the area of ​​the Ojcow National Park and its buffer zone. The number of species recorded in the Ojcéw National Park appears relatively high in
comparison with other areas in Poland where the fauna of Psylloidea has been the subject of
detailed faunistic surveys: in the Bieszezady National Park, 30 species were found
(Klimaszewski 1971, Drohojowska & Klimaszewski 2000), in the Gorce National Park - 39
(Glowacka & Migula 1996), in the Babia Gora National Park - 17 (Glowacka 1979). The bridge
were found in the Tatra National Park - 58 (Smreczyfski 1957, Drohojowska & Glowacka
2011). Given the small ONP area, the species richness seems particularly high. The diversity of the flora and plant communities of the Park determines the diversity of the
Psylloidea fauna. The Psylloidea listed here are tied to several types of environments: forest
communities, meadows of different type and herbaceous communities, xerothermic grasslands
and scrubs, felling sites and ruderal communities. They also occur on ornamental plants and
fruit trees. It should be noted that adult wintering psyllids related to herbacaeous plants change
their environment in the fall and fly to coniferous trees (e.g. Trioza flavipennis, T. urticae were
noted on spruce and Aphalara polygoni were found on evergreen misletoe Viscum album). The largest amount of psyllid species were collected in forest habitats. These 13 species
include: Rhinocola aceris feeding on the Acer genus, Psylla alni related to the Alnus genus,
Trioza remota - this is Quercus oaks, Chameapsylla hartigii - this is Betula sp. birch, Cacopsylla ulmi
- to Ulmus spp., Two species of psyllids residing on a Fraxinus excelsior ash: Psyllopsis
discrepans and P. fraxini and several species residing on the Salix willow: Cacopsylla
ambigua, C. moscovita, C. nigrita, C. pulchra, C. saliceti, Bactericera albiventris. The largest
numbers of “forest” psyllids are found in riparian communities, which - in the ONP - are ones
of the most degraded communities and form specific patches in two locations: the Pradnik
valley and the Saspowska valley. Another group (12 species) consists of the psyllids residing on the plants of meadows and
herbaceous communities. These are populating both humid meadows and herbaceous
communities in the Pradnik and Saspowska valleys, but are more common in mesophilic
meadows located at the plateau or at the slopes of valleys that are floristically richer
(Murownia, Zabugaje, Wielmoza). Seven species of the Trioza genus are included in that
group: Trioza: T. agrophila, T. centranthi, T. dispar, T. flavipennis, T. urticae and T. cirsii,
three species of the Craspedolepta genus: C. artemisiae. C. flavipennis, C. latior. and two
of the Aphalara genus: A. exilis and A. polygoni. In the group of species related to meadows,
the most interesting seems to be the Craspedolepta flavipennis, a polyphage residing on the
plants from the Chrysanthemum, Leontodon, Crepis and Hypochoeris genus. The psyllid is
common in the Carpathian mountains (Glowacka 1979, Malenovsky & Lauterer 2011),
Gorce mountains (Glowacka & Migula 1996), Tatras (Drohojowska & Glowacka 2011),
Sudetes (Glowacka 1989) and is rare in lowlands - noted in isolated communities in the
Upper Silesia, the Greater Poland - Kuyavia lowland, the Pomeranian Lakeland and the

Burckhardt 2004) but the northern boundary of occurrence thereof is in Poland. Another group is constituted by thermophilic species residing at the xerothermic grasslands
and in thermophillic scrubs. The following reside in the thermophilic schrubs: two species of
psyllids related to Rhamnus: T. rhamni and Trichochermes walkeri, three species of the
Cacopsylla genus related to Crataegus: C. crataegi, C. melanura and C. peregrina, Cacapsylla
pruni. - on blackhtorn and Arytaina genistae residing on insolated loess slopes covered with
Cytisus scoparius. Xerothermic grasslands, on the other hand, are inhabited by the polyphage
of the Apiaceae - Dyspersa apicalis, Craspedoplepta malachitica residing on Artemisia
absithium, which is considered typical to steppe (Klimaszewski 1975) and C. nervosa
developing on the Achillea and Trioza galii provided with Galium sp. and Ononis sp. The four
latter species of psyllids were collected in grasslands located at southern insolated slopes in
Grodzisko and Gérkowa Skata, which are the sanctuary of xerothermic species of plants and
invertebrates of various groups. A poorly isolated group is constituted by psyllids found in ruderal and felling sites and
sometimes meadow communities: polyphage - Bactericera nigricornis, related to the
Artemisia vulgaris - Craspedolepta omissa and the species residing on Epilobium
angustifolium: Craspedolepta subpunctata and C. nebulosa. C. subpunctata and two other
species of psyllids: Trioza dispar, and Cacopsylla nigrita were known in Poland only from the
Tatras (Drohojowska & Glowacka 2011) and Sudetes (Glowacka 1989) and the latter species is
considered to exhibit a boreal-upland distribution in Europe (Klimaszewski 1975) and
submontane and montain regions in the Czech Republic (Malenovsky & Lauterer 2011). Well
boreal species have been found in the ONP. Further analyzes of the psyllids' distribution may
be found to be insufficiently reliable due to the selective knowledge of the psyllids residing in
Poland and the Palearctic realm. A similar conclusion had been reached by Klimaszewski
(1975) over 40 years ago - unfortunately this remains to be true. The list of Psylloidea of ​​the ONP ends with the species residing in orchards - on the pear
tree: Cacopsylla pyri, C. pyricola and C. pyrisuga, the apple tree - C. mali and the ornamental
shrub - Hippophae rhamnoides sea buckthorn - C. hippophaes. Until recently, the last of the
mentioned psyllids was considered rare and only related to the Baltic sea litoral (Smreezyhski
1954, Klimaszewski 1963). It was later noted on the Tarnowskie Gory Hummock (Kanturski &
Drohojowska 2013) and as of recent, it was multiple times collected by the authors in the entire
country from the planted sea buckthorn. It was thus spread around the country along with its
host plant. Two psyllids found in the Park: Cacopsylla crataegi and C. flavipennis are included
in the Polish red list of endangered species, in the LC lower risk category (Drohojowska et al. 2002). The investigation of psyllidofauna in the ONP shall provide an insight into biodiversity of
an area under special environmental protection, i.e. a national park. It is particularly important
in connection with the special character of the ONP, due to constant presence and activity of
man within its area (Partyka 1990). Providing better insight into the relationship of psyllids and
their host plants and other organisms that are related to them is of vital importance both to
environmental protection and to the protection of biological diversity. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

SUMMARY
[Koliszki (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) of the Ojców National Park (southern Poland)]

The paper presents a list of Koliszkéw (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) found in the area
Ojców National Park and its buffer zone. The occurrence of 46 species has been recorded
koliszkéw of the four families: Aphalaridae, Liviidae, Psyllidae and Triozidae. Method demonstrated
only two species have been reported earlier from this area and 44 are new statements
for the fauna of the Ojców National Park. The most numerous group of koliszkéw are taxa
related to forests and meadows and herbs communities. Recorded here: Craspedoplepta
flavipennis (Foerster, 1848), typical of the mountain regions and reaching in Poland
northern boundary of the range, Boreal-mountainous Cacopsylla nigrita (Zetterstedt,
1828) and Craspedoplepta malachitica (Dahlbom, 1851) considered a typical steppe species
occurring in Poland. Accepted: 5 November 2018
