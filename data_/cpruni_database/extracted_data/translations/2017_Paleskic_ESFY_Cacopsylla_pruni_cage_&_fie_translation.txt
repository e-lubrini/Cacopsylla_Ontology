Introduction

Abstract

The efficacy and the instant effect of 13 insecticides and antifeedants towards
Cacopsylla pruni, the vector of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ were
examined in cage studies (no choice experiments with 10 field-collected over-
wintered adults per experiment) on potted apricot trees (budding trees under
outdoor conditions in early spring and foliated seedlings kept at 21°C). Cyper-
methrin caused 100% insect mortality within 2-4h, thiacloprid 90-100%
mortality within 24h both on foliated and on budding trees. On budding trees
spinosad led to 70-90% mortality within 24h, thixotropic white trunk paint
to 90% mortality within 48 h. On foliated seedlings flonicamid gave 70-100%
mortality within 1 day, abamectin, spinosad, acetamiprid and spirotetramat
70-100% within 72h. Field studies monitoring the effects of thiacloprid on
remigrants of C. pruni by yellow sticky traps were carried out in two apricot
orchards. Additionally the influence of the insecticide on insect dispersal was
examined by mark, release and recapture trials. As compared to the control
thiacloprid significantly reduced the catches of naturally occurring and released
insects, decreased the number of trees on which released insects were recap-
tured (by 25-100%) and shortened the migration distances of the released
insects by more than half. Our results suggest that appropriate insecticide treat-
ments both reduce C. pruni populations and have a direct effect on pathogen
transmission. Application of Cypermethrin before bloom and thiacloprid after
bloom seem best suited to achieve these objectives. Thixotropic white trunk
paint could, a formulation for spray application provided, eventually be a
sustainable alternative or complement for treatments before bloom. et al., 2010; Riedle-Bauer et al., 2012) and transmitted by

European Stone Fruit Yellows (ESFY) caused by ‘Candi-
datus Phytoplasma prunorum’ is currently present in all
European and Mediterranean regions where apricots are
cultivated (Marcone et al., 2010). The phytoplasma pri-
marily infects plants of the genus Prunus, inducing severe
damage in susceptible crops, such as apricots (Prunus
armeniaca) and Japanese plums (Prunus salicina). ESFY is
easily disseminated via propagation material (Marcone

1998). C. pruni is univoltine and migrates to Prunus spp. at the end of winter/in early spring. On Prunus spp. the
insects lay eggs which develop through five immature
stages into adults. The new generation adults abandon
their Prunus hosts and spend the rest of the year on
their overwintering shelter plants (conifers) (Ossiannils-
son 1992; Jarausch & Jarausch, 2016). Management of Cacopsylla pruni

C. pruni transmits the phytoplasma in a persistent man-
ner. Minimum acquisition periods of 2-4 days, minimum
latent periods of 2-3 weeks and minimum inoculation
access periods (IAP) of 1-2 days were observed (Car-
raro etal., 2001). Most new generation adults develop-
ing on infected plants complete their minimum latent
period only after movement to their overwintering shelter
plants. When they remigrate to their Prunus hosts in early
spring they efficiently transmit the pathogen. In com-
parison pathogen spread by the springtime generation is
regarded as negligible (Carraro et al., 2001, 2004; Thébaud
et al., 2009). Up to now management of C. pruni is not well studied,
efficiency of insecticides both on the transmitting insect
and on pathogen spread still have to be evaluated (Mar-
cone et al., 2010; Jarausch & Torres, 2014). The principal
goal of insecticide application in orchards is to keep vec-
tor populations as low as possible and in consequence
to minimise the pathogen spread. Remigrating C. pruni,
however, move into the orchards from untreated host
plants outside. Therefore the first tree(s) in an orchard
reached by an infectious individual can only be protected
by insecticides that not only reduce vector populations but
also directly influence pathogen transmission. The crucial
point in this context is the minimum IAP of 1-2 days. Insecticides with a ‘knock down’ or instant effect acting
in less than 1 day would prevent successful inoculation of
healthy trees. Rapid chemical-induced alterations of the
vector feeding behaviour could also influence pathogen
transmission as described for plant viruses (Perring et al.,
1999). In Austria overwintered C. pruni are present in
apricot orchards from the beginning of March until the
middle of May (Maier et al., 2013). So far, however, the
effects of insecticides sprayed at very early developmen-
tal stages of the trees and cool temperatures in spring are
not well established. In addition the fact that the steadily
remigrating adults can reinfest plants soon after applica-
tion makes products with long lasting residues desirable. Actual effects of insecticides on disease rates are diffi-
cult to ascertain in the field. Such experiments require a
considerable amount of time to complete, as several years
can elapse between the phytoplasma infection of a tree
and a positive laboratory test (Riedle-Bauer ef a/., 2012). For the same reason the true infection status of a future
test orchard is difficult to evaluate. Initially undetected
infections may in the end lead to false results in insecti-
cide experiments. C. pruni management requires a strat-
egy for the entire insect flight period which subsequently
can be tested for its effect on disease rates. The effect of
a single insecticide measure on the disease rate is hardly
discernable. Previous field experiments in Italy aiming to con-
trol ESFY by insecticides (chlorpyrifos, etofenprox,

 

 

 

C. Paleskié et al,

azadirachtin, malathion, phosalone, rotenone) showed
inconclusive results. Impacts of treatments in April and
May on disease rates were only detected in the minority
of tests (Poggi Pollini et al, 2007). In contrast, successful
use of insecticides was reported for the management
of apple proliferation phytoplasma (‘Candidatus Phy-
toplasma mali’). Apple proliferation is transmitted by
Cacopsylla picta and Cacopsylla melanoneura, two psyllid
species hibernating on conifers and migrating to the
orchards in late winter or spring (Tedeschi & Alma,
2004; Jarausch et al., 2011; Jarausch & Jarausch, 2014)
Semi-field experiments proved the effect of chlorpyrifos
and etofenprox towards C. melanoneura (Baldessari et al.,
2010). In the field, insecticides (various active ingredi-
ents, up to three applications before, during and after
flowering of the apple trees) significantly reduced the dis-
ease rate in the province of Bolzano (Italy) (Osterreicher
& Unterthurner, 2015)

The aim of the present study was to evaluate various
insecticides with different modes of action for their effects
on C. pruni. Extent and speed of insecticide action were
examined in cage trials involving different developmental
stages of test trees, different external conditions and insec-
ticide residues of different ages. In field experiments the
effects of thiacloprid were studied in two apricot orchards. Observations of insecticide effects towards C. pruni remi-
grants in treated and untreated plots were complemented
by mark, release and recapture trials. Materials and methods
Cage studies

The effect of various insecticides and putative antifeedants
was studied in no choice tests on potted apricot trees. Concentrations and manufacturers of the products
evaluated in this study are indicated in Table 1. Test
concentrations were calculated on basis of the amounts
of formulated ingredients per hectare and the spray
volume recommended by the manufactures. Out of the
tested compounds only one ‘classical insecticide’, the
neonicotinoid thiacloprid is currently registered for plum
sucker treatment in Austria (AGES, 2015). In addition the
compound kaolin is allowed as plant strengthening agent. All other compounds are either currently registered or
have recently been registered for other pests of apricots,
for other fruit crops, or are intended for other purposes
in fruit production. The test plants were sprayed to run
off with the tested products using a 2L hand sprayer. Treatments were applied starting at the uppermost leaves
and working towards the base of the plant, ensuring
that the entire surface was sprayed. Plants were allowed
to air dry before the placement of insects for approxi-
mately 2h, in case of aged residue tests for the specified

duration. Control plants received water treatment only. All experiments were carried out with C. pruni remigrants. Insects were field collected by beating tray method on
Prunus spinosa in March and April immediately before
(1-2h) release on the test trees. The experiments included test plants in different devel-
opmental stages and different temperature conditions:
For the first group of experiments aiming to simulate
orchard conditions before flowering one-year-old apri-
cot seedlings obtained from a nursery (size approximately
50cm) were potted and cultivated until BBCH (Biol-
ogische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemical
industry) stage 03-09 (end of bud swelling/development
of green tips, the BBCH scale has been used according to
Meier et al, 1994). The experiments were conducted in
March and at the beginning of April under outdoor condi-
tions, but protected from rain. Ten insects per experiment
were introduced into transparent cylindrical cages (diam-
eter 3.cm, length 10 cm) attached to the individual plants. Insect mortality was assessed daily for 4—5 days. For the second group aiming to simulate apricot trees
with developing leaves after flowering at already warmer
outdoor conditions apricot seeds were harvested in an
apricot orchard (cv. ‘Klosterneuburger Marille’), grown
in our lab and cultivated for approximately 3 months
until they had 8-10 fully expanded leaves. Single plants
were entirely covered with transparent cylindrical cages
(diameter 9 cm, height 25 cm). Ten insects were released
into each cage. Insect survival was recorded daily for 6
days. Before and during the insecticide experiments the
test plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 21°C. The effect of residue age on insecticide activity was
studied on test trees in BBCH stage 10 (BBCH scale:
Meier et al., 1994; the already mentioned potted, one year
old apricot seedlings were allowed to develop leaves)
After insecticide treatment the test trees were kept under
outdoor conditions unprotected from rain for 2, 7 and
14 days before the beginning of the experiments. Cage
experiments were carried out as described above and
numbers of surviving insects were determined after 1 day. The instant or ‘knock down’ effects of thiacloprid and
cypermethrin were also investigated. Test plants and con-
ditions were the same as described above (one-year-old
apricot seedlings at BBCH stage 03-09 under outdoor
conditions and foliated 3 months old seedlings at 21°C),
but insect survival was recorded at more frequent inte! vals (starting 30-60 min. after insect release). The asses:
ment of instant effects included fresh (2 h old) residues of
thiacloprid and cypermethrin and also 4 days old residues
of thiacloprid

All tests were repeated at least four times (four inde-
pendent experiments each including one test tree and
10 insects caged on it — in total 40 insects and four trees

The field experiments were carried out in two apricot
orchards in Lower Austria. On basis of our cage results
and due to the fact that thiacloprid is registered for plum
sucker treatment in Austria this compound was selected. Description of the

experimental orchards and spraying

 

1. Krems: The orchard comprises five standard tree
rows with 23 approximately 15 years old trees
per row, within row tree spacing ranges from 4
to 5m, while between row distance is 6m. Ran-
dom sampling of trees and PCR assays (2012)
revealed a phytoplasma infection rate of 31.25%
(Maier et al., 2013). Application of insecticide: Mi
terer trailer sprayer (1000L series) (Mitterer, Ter-
lan, Italy), cross flow blower equipped with 14
Albuz ATR hollow cone spray nozzles, spray pres-
sure 10 bar, driving speed 5kmh!, volume of spray
500Lha“!, 96.2g of thiacloprid (active ingredi-
ent) ha“! in water, no spreader or other addition. Each trial covered 10 trees in 5 rows. In 2013 one
control and one insecticide trial were performed
successively (control 18-25.4, stain green, thia-
cloprid: 25.4—-2.5, stain pink), in 2014 simultane-
ously (7.4—14.4, control plot stain pink, thiacloprid
plot stain white). 2. Klosterneuburg: The orchard includes nine rows
with 34 trees per row, within row spacing is 2 m, the
distance between rows is 4m, the spindle-shaped
trees are approximately 15 years old. The over-
all phytoplasma infection rate is not known, pres-
ence of the pathogen on five symptomatic trees
was confirmed by PCR assays only (unpublished). Application of insecticide: Wanner DA 32 axial
cross flow blower (Wanner, Wengen im Allgau,
Germany) equipped with 16 Albuz ATR hollow
cone spray nozzles, spray pressure 9bar, driv-
ing speed 4.5kmh~!, volume of spray 500 Lha"!,
96.2g of thiacloprid (active ingredient) ha“! in
water, no spreader or other addition. Each experi-
ment comprised 15 trees in nine rows. In 2013, one
control and one insecticide trial were performed
successively (control 23-29.4, stain pink, thiaclo-
prid: 29.4—-6.5, stain green), in 2014 simultane-
ously (7.4-17.4, control plot stain pink, thiacloprid
plot stain green). The insecticide was applied to the entire thiaclo-
prid plots. Control plots remained untreated (no water
spraying). Management of Cacopsylla pruni

Buteler & Stadler (2011), Puterka et al. (2005), Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (2016). The survey on naturally occurring C. pruni in the
experimental plots was enlarged by mark, release and
recapture experiments. Remigrant C. pruni were col-
lected on P. spinosa by beating tray method. Marking of
insects with fluorescent pigments was performed as pre-
viously described (Nakata 2008; Maier et al., 2013). The
following stains were used: Pink (Karmin Tagesleucht-
pigment, Artmaxx, Berlin, Germany), white and green
(UV Elements, Germany, http://www.uv-elements.de/
tagesleuchtpigment-p-37.html). Effects of the pigment
on insect survival and stability of the stains under out-
door conditions were examined as previously described
(Maier et al., 2013). Insect release was carried out approxi-
mately 4h after insecticide application (dry spray deposit). Collection of insects, staining and release happened in
no more than 6h. In each experiment 600 stained C.
pruni were freed on one single tree (in case of thia-
cloprid plots an insecticide treated tree) in the middle
of the experimental plot. At the start of each exper-
iment the insects were caged on the branches of the
release tree in transparent plastic tubes with gaze houses
on both ends for approximately 90min. (Maier et al.,
2013). This procedure allowed us to check insect sur-
vival during and after transfer to the field and ensured
that the insects settled on the release tree and started
to feed. Both naturally occurring and artificially released spec-
imens in the orchards were monitored by yellow sticky
traps for 1-2 weeks (63-74 traps per experiment, size
of traps 15cm x21 cm). The traps were fixed in the mid-
dle of the trees at 1.5—2m height and remained in the
orchard for the duration of the experiments (8-14 days). During the experiments the traps were examined with
free eye in regular intervals. Every single C. pruni detected
on the traps (without discrimination between stained
or unstained individuals) was immediately labelled by
a self-adhesive sticker (diameter 3mm glued onto the
traps right beside each individual, different colours of
stickers according to days after begin of the experi-
ment). At the end of the trials the traps were trans-
ferred to the laboratory and inspected under a binocular
microscope. All C. pruni were recorded and assigned to
the capture period (days after begin of the experiment)
by aid of the coloured stickers. Marked and unmarked
insects were differentiated by means of UV light (stan-
dard UV transilluminator Vilbert Lormat, Marne la Valee,
France). Statistical analyses

tics program SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Ann Appl Biol (2017)

Cage studies

Insect survival rates in the experiments were displayed
as boxplots. The boxes represent the interquartile (IQ)
range which contains the middle 50% of the records and
show the median. Outliers (values between 1.5 and three
times the IQ range) are identified with an O. Extreme
values (more than three times the IQ range) are marked

The normality of the variables was evaluated by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The values of insect survival
were not normally distributed, even after transforma-
tion. Therefore, data were analysed by the nonparametric
Kruskal Wallis test. For this test the sum of the ranks for
each group and then the test statistic H was computed. H
was compared to the critical value of a chi square distri-
bution. When significant, post hoc analyses by
comparisons (Mann-Whitney test for each pair of groups
using a Bonferroni multiple comparison procedure) were
performed. pairwise

Field experiments

For analysis of insect presence in the thiacloprid and con-
trol plots numbers of individuals on each sticky trap were
compared. Each experiment (Krems and Klosterneuburg,
2013 and 2014) was analysed individually. Data were not
normally distributed, thus comparisons were carried out
by aid of Mann Whitney U-test (on the basis of the ranks
for each group the test statistic U is computed and com-
pared to critical values). The numbers of trees visited by the marked specimen
in the mark, release and recapture experiments were also
compared by Mann Whitney U-test. For the analysis data
from all experiments (Krems and Klosterneuburg, 2013
and 2014) were pulled together. Results

Cage experiments on budding seedlings (BBCH stage
03-09) under outdoor conditions

On budding test trees kept at outdoor conditions applica-
tion of cypermethrin resulted in 100% insect mortality,
application of spinosad and thiacloprid in 70-90% mor-
tality within 24h. Spraying of white trunk paint caused
around 50% mortality within 24h and 90% mortality
within 2 days. On plants sprayed with flonicamid, kaolin,
paraffin oil or wax 30-40% of the insects were still alive
after 4 days. Comparisons of insect survival 1, 2 and 4 days
after release on the test plants revealed significant differ-
ences between treatments (Kruskal Wallis test, P< 0.001,
d.£.=9, Hjgy: = 38.3; Hjgyy = 41.78; Hygyq = 35.4). Pairwise
comparisons of survival after 1 day validated a signif-
icant effect (P<0.05) of cypermethrin, thiacloprid and

spinosad as compared to the untreated control. A signif-
icant effect of white trunk paint on insect mortality was
verified after 2 days (P < 0.05). Applications of flonicamid,
paraffin oil, kaolin and wax did not have any statistically
validated effect on insect survival in comparison to the
control (Fig. 1). Cage experiments on foliated, 3 months old apricot
seedlings kept at 21°C

Cypermethrin sprayed on foliated test plants caused
100% insect mortality within 24h. Applications of
thiacloprid led to 90-100% mortality, applications of
flonicamid to 70-100% mortality within 1 day. Insect
mortality on plants sprayed with abamectin and spinosad
varied considerably after the first 24h, but mortality rates
rose to 70-100% within 72 h. Insect mortality for applica-
tions of acetamiprid and spirotetramat was only 10-40%
after 24h, rising steadily to approximately 80% after 3
days and to 100% by 6 days (Fig. 2). Statistical analysis of
insect survival 1, 3 and 6 days after insect release proved
significant differences between treatments (Kruskal
Wallis test, P<0.001, d.f.=9, Hyqy, =40,9; Hays =29,8;
Hqayo=40,4). Pairwise comparisons of insect survival
validated a significant effect (P< 0.05) of cypermethrin,
thiacloprid and flonicamid after 1 day as compared to
the untreated control. Three days after release insect
mortality on plants sprayed with abamectin and spinosad
varied significantly from the control treatment (P < 0.05). A statistically significant effect of acetamiprid and spirote-
tramat in comparison to the water control was verified
after 6 days only (P< 0.05). Application of garlic extract
and azadirachtin showed no statistically significant effect
on insect survival. Cage experiments with aged insecticide residues

Residues of thiacloprid and cypermethrin on trees in
BBCH stage 10 remained effective for more than 1 week. Two and 7 days old residues of both compounds gave
insect mortality rates of up to 100% within 24h. Effects
of both compounds in comparison to the water treated
control were statistically validated (Kruskal Wallis anal-
ysis P<0.001, df.=6; H=35.5; pairwise comparisons
P<0.05). After 14 days cypermethrin still induced insect
mortality rates between 80% and 100%, thiacloprid rates
between 50% and 80%. At this point of time, however,
with our test procedure insect survival on treated plants
and control plants was not statistically discernible any
more (Fig. 3)

2h. Fresh (2h old) thiacloprid killed 80-90% of the
insects within 4h. On test plants with 4 days old thiaclo-
prid residues more than half of the insects were still alive
after 4h (Fig. 4). Cypermethrin acted faster than thiaclo-
prid. Already after 30 min. significantly fewer insects were
alive on cypermethrin trees than on trees with 2h old
thiacloprid residues (Mann Whitney U=4.03, P< 0.001). After 60 min insect mortality on cypermethrin trees var-
ied significantly from mortality on trees with 4 day old
thiacloprid residues (Kruskal Wallis analysis P< 0.001,
df. =6; H=35.5; pairwise comparisons P< 0.05). On test trees in BBCH stage 03-09 under outdoor con-
ditions cypermethrin killed all insects within 4h. Fresh
(2h old) thiacloprid residues caused 90-100% mortal-
ity after 24h, 4 days old thiacloprid residues 50-90%
mortality within 24h (Fig. 4). Our statistical test proce-
dure, however, did not indicate any significant difference
between the treatments. Effects of thiacloprid under field conditions

In all test replications (Krems and Klosterneuburg, 2013
and 2014) application of thiacloprid sharply reduced the
numbers of unmarked, naturally occurring C. pruni on the
yellow sticky traps in comparison to the untreated control

plots. This effect, however, was not noticed within the first
24h after spraying (Fig. 5 and Appendix $1). Accordingly,
statistically significant differences between the treatments
within the first 24h were not detected in any of the
replications. After 72h numbers on individuals on the
traps were significantly lower in treated plots Krems 2014:
Mann Whitney U = 3.15, P< 0.001; Klosterneuburg 2013:
Mann Whitney U = 2.03, P< 0.001; Klosterneuburg 2014:

difference in comparison to the water treated control (P< 0.05) from the indicated day onwards. outdoor conditions for 5 weeks the marked insects were
clearly discernible from unmarked specimens by means of
UV light. Adverse effects of the stains on insect survival
were not observed. Survival rates of stained insects 1,
3 and 7 days after beginning of the experiments were
comparable to unstained insects (Kruskal Wallis analysis:
df. =3, day 1: P=0.85, H=0.79; day 3: P=0.63, H= 1.72;
day 7: P=0.86, H=0.734) (Appendix $2). Application of thiacloprid reduced the number of trees
on which marked insects were recaptured by 25-100% in
comparison to the untreated control (Fig. 6, Appendices
$3-S6). Pulling data from all experiments (Krems and
Klosterneuburg, 2013 and 2014) together this reduction
was statistically significant (Mann Whitney U=15.5,
P=0.029). In untreated control plots between 2.6% and 7.5%
of the released specimens were recaptured, in insecticide
plots between 0% and 1.8% (Fig. 6, Appendices $3-S$6). At the end of the experiments (after 8 and 14 days,
respectively) a significant influence of thiacloprid on the
overall number of marked and recaptured specimens per
trap was ascertained in Klosterneuburg in both experi-
mental years (2013: Mann Whitney U=2.52, P< 0.001;

in 2014 (Mann Whitney U=2.81, P=0.033). Within 24h
of insect release, however, recaptures in treated and con-
trol plots were not statistically different in any of the
trials. In all untreated control experiments marked specimen
migrated to the farthest traps and even beyond (into the
neighbouring insecticide plot) within 24 h (in Krems 2014
maximum distance around 40 m, in all other experiments
around 20m). In the thiacloprid plots insects were pre-
dominantly recaptured in the vicinity of the release tree
(maximum distance covered around 12 m in Krems 2014,
in all other experiments maximum distance around 8m)
(Fig.6, Appendices $3-S6). Discussion

The first objective of C. pruni management in apricot
orchards is to keep populations as low as possible and
in consequence to minimise the potential for pathogen
spread. Our data indicate that especially cypermethrin
and thiacloprid cause high insect mortality and will there-
fore contribute to achieve this goal. In addition our
results show that both products effectively control C. pruni
in orchards for more than 1 week. In course of our

experiments on budding trees we observed interesting
effects of Weissanstrich (white trunk paint) on insect
mortality. In principle this product is used to avoid
frost damage of stems during winter. We included it in
our tests because presumably it produces a stable parti-
cle film. Previous experiments have demonstrated that
particle films reduced settling and oviposition of adult
C. pyricola and that the insects had difficulty grasping par-
ticle film-treated leaves (Puterka et al., 2005). In addition
our study indicated that application of spinosad before
and after bloom and flonicamid, abamectin, acetamiprid
and spirotetramat after bloom could decrease vector pop-
ulations and thus also lower the risk of pathogen spread. The benefit of the tested insecticides in terms of actu-
ally preventing pathogen inoculation, however, requires
a differentiated assessment. Insecticides protecting trees
from becoming infected must disrupt the insect feeding
behaviours in a shorter time than the minimum IAP. In
line with expectations our experiments proved a rapid
knock down effect of the pyrethroid cypermethrin in
a considerably shorter period of time (2-4h) than the
reported minimum IAP. These results indicate that cyper-
methrin effectively prevents phytoplasma inoculation
before and after blossom. Comparable to our results
high knock down rates exceeding 90% within 1 day

C. Paleskié et al,

were observed for the pyrethroid etofenprox towards
overwintered stages of the psyllid C. melanoneura
(Baldessari et al., 2010). High mortality rates within 24h were also assessed
for thiacloprid on foliated seedlings indicating that fresh
spraying deposits of thiacloprid provide at least some
direct protection against infections of trees after bloom. On budding trees in contrast, the compound was less
effective. In all experiments ageing of thiacloprid residues
for 4 days seemed to delay the insecticide effect although
differences between the two thiacloprid variants were
not significant. Thus the ability of thiacloprid to actu-
ally prevent pathogen inoculation in case of dormant
trees, cold temperature and aged residues appears prob-
able but it is not completely clear. However, literature
data point out that neonicotinoids could quickly change
the feeding behaviour of insects. The neonicotinoid imi-
dacloprid disrupted the feeding behaviour of the Asian
citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), the vector of ‘Candidatus
Liberibacter spp.’, and the authors concluded that the
compound greatly reduced the likelihood of pathogen
transmission (Serikawa et al., 2010, 2012). Imidacloprid
also significantly prevented the transmission of chrysan-
themum yellows phytoplasma by the leafhopper Macroste-
les quadripunctulatus (Saracco et al., 2008). Wheat aphids
(Sitobion avenae) exposed to sublethal doses of thiacloprid
performed longer no-probing phases and shorter phloem-
sap-ingestion phases (Miao et al., 2014). In Italy thia-
cloprid is successfully implemented in strategies against
apple proliferation (Osterreicher & Unterthurner, 2015). In the present study a significant insecticide action
within 24 h was also ascertained for flonicamid on foliated
trees. Flonicamid acts systemically against hemipterous
pests. In case of aphids this compound inhibited the feed-
ing behaviour within 0.5 h of treatment and this antif
ing activity was not recoverable until death (Morita
etal., 2007). Provided an equivalent effect on C. pruni
flonicamid could reduce phytoplasma transmission. Our
experiments also proved a rapid action of spinosad on
budding trees in BBCH stage 03-09. Spinosad, however,
has the disadvantage of quick degradation (Belien et al.,
2013). Several of the insecticides included in the current study
partly or predominantly act via systemic translocation
in the plant and ingestion by herbivorous insects. Their
effect might start after some days only. Thus our test set
up with insect release right after insecticide application
could have led to an underestimation of their knock down
effect. For example on foliated trees effects of spirote-
tramat and acetamiprid were only observed after some
days. An adapted test procedure including some days
between insecticide application and insect release might
be additionally required to judge their speed of action. Ann Appl Biol (2017)

Figure 6 Field experiment in Klosterneuburg 2013: The size and shape of the control plot (a) and the thiacloprid plot (b) and the number and position of the
yellow sticky traps used for insect monitoring are presented. In addition the position of the release tree in the mark-, release- and recapture experiment and the
recaptures of marked insects in both plots are illustrated. The control experiment was carried out from 23.4 to 29.4, the thiacloprid experiment from 29.4 to 6.5. The data of our cage studies indicate that some insecti-
cides, for example cypermethrin and thiacloprid provide
at the least some direct protection against infections of
trees. For unequivocal conclusions, however, the actual
effects of these and all other insecticidal compounds must
additionally be assessed by transmission experiments. At the beginning of the experiments we feared that
insecticide effects on potted seedlings might, to some
degree, differ from field tests, for example due to altered

10

application efficiency or plant age and size. As it turned
out, however, our field experiments yielded largely the
same results in terms of effectiveness, speed of action and
durability of thiacloprid. In addition the mark, release
and recapture experiments enabled us to track the influ-
ence of thiacloprid on spatial dispersal of C. pruni. In
treated plots significantly fewer marked insects were
recaptured on significantly fewer trees. The distances cov-
ered by the insects were reduced by more than half. Ann Appl Biol (2017)

C. Paleskié et al,

These observations suggest that thiacloprid also lowers
the risk of pathogen spread by influencing the spatial
movement of the (incoming) vectors. The congruence
between cage and field results allows the conclusion
that cage studies are a valuable tool for pre selection of
insecticides. On basis of our data an application of thiacloprid
right after flowering can be recommended for ESFY vec-
tor management. Recent studies suggest that the agent
adversely influences the navigation memory of honey
bees (Fischer et al., 2014), thus an application shortly
before or during flowering could give rise to unwanted
bee problems. Our present results indicate a very good
effect of cypermethrin both on trees before and after
bloom. Pyrethroids, however, are non-selective, target
also beneficial insects and have adverse effects on hon-
eybees (Civolani, 2012; Palmquist ef a/., 2012; Belien
etal., 2013). An authorisation provided an application
of cypermethrin for phytoplasma vector management
seems most reasonable on budding trees at the begin-
ning of insect remigration. Also in South Tyrol (Italy)
a pyrethroid (etofenprox) is recommended for man-
agement of Caco-psylla picta at the beginning of insect
remigration (Osterreicher & Unterthurner, 2015). Weis-
sanstrich (white trunk paint) could be an environmen-
tally friendly alternative or complement to ‘classical insec-
ticides’ in orchards at early developmental stages. Before
use in practice, however, an adapted formulation of the
active ingredients and extensive field tests would be
required. Beyond the current considerations intensified
research efforts are necessary to test additional insecti-
cides, antifeedants and repellents for their potential to be
included in sustainable management concepts. All in all the present study permits an assessment
of the tested insecticides with regard to their effect on
vector populations and their direct effect on pathogen
inoculation. The current and similar experiments are
suitable as a basis for management concepts. In the end,
however, it must be borne in mind that the effect of any
C. pruni management strategy on the disease rates must
be proven by long standing field observations. Acknowledgements
