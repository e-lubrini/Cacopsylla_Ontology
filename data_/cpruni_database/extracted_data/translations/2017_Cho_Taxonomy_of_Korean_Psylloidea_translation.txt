Abstract

The taxonomy of jumping plant-lice from South Korea is revised based on extensive, recently collected material and spec-
imens preserved in several collections. Three species are described as new (Craspedolepta yongjungi, Cacopsylla bacca-
tae and Cyamophila floribundae spp. nov.) and 11 species are recorded from South Korea for the first time (Aphalaridae
2, Homotomidae 1, Liviidae 1, Psyllidae 6, Triozidae 1). One genus and 13 species are synonymised, two species are re-
moved from synonymy and two species are recombined. Comments on the taxonomy are provided and previous misiden-
tifications are discussed. Key words: psyllids, taxonomy, Aphalaridae, Calophyidae, Homotomidae, Psyllidae, Macrocorsinae, Psyllinae, Triozi-
dae, new species, new records, South Korea

Introduction

Psyllids or jumping plant-lice are small, phloem-feeding insects which are best known for a few economically
important pests such as Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, 1908 and Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc, 1909). The knowledge
on the other almost 4,000 described psyllid species (Li, 2011; Burckhardt & Ouvrard 2012) is, however, limited
and many taxonomic problems remain to be solved. In East Asia, 1,001 species have been reported from China (Li 2011), 152 from Japan (Ouvrard 2016), 98 from
Korea (Kwon ef al. 2015a) and 132 from the Russian Far East (Konovalova 1988). Considerable confusion exists
in the taxonomy of East Palaearctic psyllids due to insufficient reference between the faunas of the four countries
and the uncritical use of old names, particularly from Europe. Here we focus on the Korean fauna. The first and only major treatment of Korean psyllids is the book by Kwon
(1983) which is a milestone in the studies of the East Asian psyllids. Its publication was followed by several
checklists (The Entomological Society of Korea & Korean Society of Applied Entomology 1994; Park 1996; Paek
et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2014; Kwon et al. 2015a). Whereas most of these lists are mere compilations that of Park
(1996) contains some new synonymies and combinations, and that of Kwon ef al. (2015a) introduces some
taxonomic changes and new species records though without providing details. The aim of the present paper is,
based on recent fieldwork throughout South Korea, to revise critically the status of some species, to describe some
new taxa, to record some species for the first time from Korea and to provide collecting data for others. Material and methods

Material for this study was examined from following institutions: BMNH—Natural History Museum, London,
UK; MHNG—Muséum d’histoire naturelle, Genéve, Switzerland; NHMB—Naturhistorisches Museum Basel,
Switzerland; NIBR—National Institute of Biological Resources, Incheon, South Korea; SNU—Seoul National
University, Seoul, South Korea. The NHMB houses a small collection by Y. J. Kwon, originally deposited in the

 

Accepted by D. Ouvrard: 12 Jan. 2017; published: 7 Mar. 2017 531

National Museum Wales, Cardiff, UK, and acquired by the NHMB through an exchange of material. This
collection contains 34 species, including paratypes, which are identified by Y. J. Kwon. The Korean provinces are abbreviated as follows: CB—Chuncheongbuk-do; GB—Gyeongsangbuk-do; GG—
Gyeonggi-do; GN—Gyeongsangnam-do; GW—Gangwon-do; JB—Jeollabuk-do; JJ—Jeju-do; JN—Jeollanam-do. The information on host plants provided for each species refers to records from Korea. The plant names follow

which suggests that their specimens belong to A. avicularis. Their material was not available for examination for
confirmation. Kwon (1983) reported Aphalara polygoni from seven provinces in South Korea, indicating that the
host plants are Polygonum spp. Kwon’s (1983: 179, plate XXXI fig. 11) illustration of the distal portion of the
aedeagus resembles that of 4. avicularis. We examined specimens identified by Kwon as A. polygoni that are A.
avicularis. We do not know, however, whether the material listed by Kwon (1983) under A. polygoni contains also
A. freji Burckhardt & Lauterer, 1997, another species associated with Persicaria spp. and Polygonum spp. or
genuine A. polygoni which develops on Rumex spp. (Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997). We have not seen specimens of
the latter and its presence in Korea is currently not confirmed. Aphatara freji Burckhardt & Lauterer, 1997

Craspedolepta yongjungi Cho & Burckhardt, sp. nov.
(Figs. 5-7, 15-20)

Craspedolepta conspersa sensu Kwon, 1983: 24, nec Low, 1888: 31. Xanioptera japonica sensu Park, 1996: 268, nec Klimaszewski, 1989: 7. Diagnosis. Adults of the new species resemble those of Craspedolepta conspersa (Léw, 1888), C. spinosa Park &
Lee, 1982, C. japonica (Klimaszewski, 1989), comb. nov. and C. kwonii (Klimaszewski, 1997), comb. nov. in the
narrow forewings bearing small dots, the apically broad paramere, that is bent in the middle, and the female
proctiger bearing a long apical process. It differs from the first species in the forewing that is narrowly rounded
apically and bears more homogeneously distributed dark dots, the female proctiger that is stronger curved and the
female subgenital plate whose ventral margin is angled in the middle and not evenly curved as in C. conspersa. From the other three species C. yongjungi differs in the brown dots that are denser and confluent in apical half of
the forewing. Description. Adult. Body colour (Figs. 5—6) green (yellow in ethanol preserved specimens), with indistinct
whitish pattern consisting of dots and longitudinal stripes on the dorsum of head and thorax, respectively. Head and
thorax covered in short macroscopic setae. Vertex with each half evenly rounded anteriorly; preocular sclerite
distinctly developed. Antenna 10-segmented, 1.17—1.24 as long as head width. Forewing slender, 2.72—3.09 times
as long as wide, narrowly rounded apically; cell m, relatively narrow, cell cu, long; pattern consisting of small
brown spots that are relatively evenly covering wing membrane, denser in apical half where they are confluent;
membrane lacking setae on dorsal surface; surface spinules fine, dense, leaving spinule-free rows along the veins. Terminalia as in Figs. 17-20. Paramere curved in the middle with broad apical half; apico-posterior edge angular. Female proctiger 1.06—1.12 times as long as head width, with concave dorsal margin and long apical process. Female subgenital plate with long apical process; ventral margin angular in the middle. Measurements (in mm; 3 3, 3 2): head width 4 0.52-0.55, 2 0.56-0.62; antenna length 3 0.63-0.66, 2

length 3 0.20-0.22, 2 0.63-0.66. Fifth instar immature. Body (Fig. 7) greenish or yellowish, elongate. Antenna 7-segmented. Forewing-pads
with small humeral lobes. Margin of wing-pads and abdomen bearing lanceolate setae. Tarsal arolium
membranous, sessile. Caudal plate angular posteriorly. Anus in ventral position; circumanal ring small, in distance
from posterior abdominal margin by more than its own length, consisting of a single row of pores. Measurements (in mm; 3 immatures): body length 1.73-1.92; body width 1.14-1.22; antenna length
0.77-0.80; forewingpad length 0.68-0.69; metatibia length 0.30-0.32; caudal plate length 0.52—0.57; caudal plate

Named in honour of Professor Yong Jung Kwon for his pioneering work on Korean psyllids. Comments. Craspedolepta conspersa was originally described from Romania [Siidungarn, Langenfeld bei
Weisskirchen] (L6w 1888; see also Conci & Tamanini 1983) and not Germany as stated by Kwon (1983). Subsequently the species was reported from Hungary (Klimaszewski 1961), Moldova (Loginova 1966), Japan
(Miyatake 1969), Italy (Conci & Tamanini 1983), Korea (Kwon 1983), the Russian Far East (Konovalova 1988),
Slovenia (Seljak 2006), Switzerland (Burckhardt & Lauterer 2009) and Serbia (Jerinié-Prodanovié 2010). The
record of Bulgaria by Klimaszewski (1973) is a likely error (Conci & Tamanini 1983). Klimaszewski (1989)
described Xanioptera (Loginovia) japonica from Japan, apparently not aware of the reports of C. conspersa from
Japan, Korea and the Russian Far East (Miyatake 1969; Kwon 1983; Konovalova 1988). Klimaszewski (1989)
suggested that X. japonica is very close to C. conspersa differing in the longer antennae and relative lengths of the
forewing veins M+Cu and Cu. For unknown reasons, Park (1996) suggested that Craspedolepta conspersa sensu

  

 

534 - Zootaxa 4238 (4) © 2017 Magnolia Press CHO ET AL. Kwon (1983) from Korea is conspecific with Xanioptera japonica. Comparison of material from Japan identified
as Xanioptera japonica and from Korea fitting Kwon’s description of C. conspersa shows subtle, though constant
differences between the two taxa. The brown dots on the forewing are sparser and rarely coalesce in the former but
are quite dense and confluent in the apical half of the forewing in the latter. The paramere in the former is slightly
more rounded at the apico-posterior edge and slightly more angular in the latter. Further, the Korean populations
differ from European C. conspersa in the more homogeneously spaced dark dots on the forewing, the apically more
narrowly rounded forewing and the more curved female terminalia. In this context, two other species are of
interest, viz. Craspedolepta spinosa Park & Lee, 1982 and Xanioptera (Loginovia) kwonii Klimaszewski, 1997. Both species are from Korea, poorly described and based on insufficient material lacking males, the former from 2
females, one of which damaged, from Mount Hallasan on Jeju Island, the latter from 2 or 3 females from Mount
Myohyang, respectively. Both share the narrow forewings bearing brown dots, but differ from the Korean material
referred to C. conspersa in the dots on the forewing that are not confluent. We conclude that 1. Craspedolepta
japonica (Klimaszewski, 1989), comb. nov. is a good species, currently known only from Japan; 2. C. spinosa and
C. kwonii (Klimaszewski, 1997), comb. nov. are distinct from both C. japonica and from Korean populations
previously referred to C. conspersa but their identity is doubtful; 3. the European and Korean populations referred
to C. conspersa are not conspecific. For this reason, we describe the latter under the name of Craspedolepta
yongjungi sp. nov.

Klimaszewski (1987), using a phenetic approach to analyse the phylogenetic relationships between Palaearctic
species, split Craspedolepta s. |. into four genera including the subgenera Xanioptera s. str. and Xanioptera
(Loginovia). This analysis is flawed with methodological shortcomings and mistakes in the observation of some
characters (Burckhardt & Lauterer 1997) and is, therefore, rejected. Here we follow the generic concepts of

confirmed by the presence of immatures. Comments. Psylla albopontis, originally described from Japan, is closely related to Cacopsylla abieti
(Kuwayama, 1908) with which it was synonymised by Miyatake (1964a). It differs from C. abieti in the forewing
which has dark patches along the apical and posterior margins rather than completely yellow to brown, the denser
setae on the inner face of the paramere and the more rounded, rather angular apical dilatation of the distal segment
of the aedeagus. We consider P. albopontis a good species of Cacopsylla, remove it from synonymy and transfer it
to Cacopsylla. Psylla danpunga Park & Lee, 1982, and Psylla moni Konovalova & Loginova, 1985 display the
same diagnostic characters as C. albopontis suggesting they are conspecific. We, therefore, synonymise them with
Cacopsylla albopontis. We have not examined material of P abieti sensu Kwon (1983). Judging from the
description it is a mix of C. albopontis and C. pseudosieboldiani (Konovalova & Loginova, 1985). The species is
associated with several Acer spp. (Sapindaceae). Cacopsylla araliae (Konovalova, 1981), comb. nov.
(Figs. 31-34)

Psylla araliae Konovalova, 1981: 11. Material examined. South Korea (JN, GW, GG) (NHMB, SNU). Host plant. Aralia elata (Miq.) Seem. (Araliaceae), confirmed by the presence of immatures. Comments. New record for Korea. This species was described in Psylla from the Russian Far East
(Konovalova 1988). Cho & Lee (2015a) reported a Cacopsylla sp. from Korea without further locality data
associated with Aralia elata (Miq.) Seem. (Araliaceae) which is referable to C. araliae. The species is congeneric
with Cacopsylla fatsiae (Jensen, 1957) and C. hederae (Miyatake, 1964), two species also associated with
Araliaceae. For this reason, it is formally transferred here to Cacopsylla. Cacopsylla baccatae Cho & Burckhardt, sp. nov.
(Figs. 35-36, 61-68)

Diagnosis. Adults of the new species resemble those of Cacopsylla malivorella (Matsumura, in (Sasaki, 1915)] and C.
myriacantha Li, 2011 in the forewing with a straight fore margin and a broadly rounded apex, as well as the short
broad paramere with a prominent antero-apical beak-like process and two groups of strongly sclerotised peg setae on
its inner face. It differs from both species in the narrower paramere whose fore margin is hardly curved in the apical
two thirds (rather than strongly curved), and in the strongly inflated apical dilatation of the distal segment of the
aedegus (rather than flattened and weakly inflated)—Immatures mostly lack capitate setae, bearing 13-15 long
marginal slightly rod-shaped setae on forewing pad and 11 on caudal plate on either side, the latter also with 2+2
marginal sectasetae. Abdomen with three large lateral and two large and a small submedian free sternites on either
side of mid-line. Circumanal ring small, close to posterior margin of subgenital plate, consisting of a single row of
pores. Description. Adult. Body colour in recently emerged specimens light green with yellow longitudinal stripes on
thorax, translucent forewings with light veins (Fig. 35); overwintered specimens dark brown to black with lighter
pattern on head and thorax, forewing greyish with dark brown veins more or less expanded dark brown pattern in apical
half, sometimes restricted to narrow stripes along the veins in overwintered specimens. Antenna light brown, segments
4-8 dark brown to black apically, segments 9 and 10 entirely black. Hindwing almost colourless, transparent. Legs
brown; tibiae and basitarsi light greyish. Head (Fig. 61) as broad as thorax; vertex subtrapezoidal, covered in
microscopic setae; preocular sclerite small and narrow; genal processes 0.7-0.9 times as long as vertex along midline,

relatively evenly conical, subacute apically, their longitudinal axis subparallel. Antenna 1.1—1.2 times as long as head
width; segment 3 the longest but not much longer than segment 4; relative length of flagellar segments as | : 0.8 : 0.7:
0.7: 0.7: 0.7 : 04 : 0.5; segments 4-8 subequal in length; relative lengths of segment 10 and terminal setae as | : 0.9
0.3. Forewing oblong oval, with straight anterior margin and broadly, slightly asymmetrically rounded apex (Fig. 62);
pterostigma evenly narrowing to apical third of r,; vein C+Sc evenly curved in the middle, cell c+sc broad; vein Rs
imperceptibly sinuous, weakly curved towards fore margin apically; veins M and M,,, distinctly curved, M,,, almost
straight; cell m, triangular; vein Cu,, moderately curved in the middle, vein Cu,, short, curved at apex; cell cu, small and
irregularly triangular; surface spinules densely spaced, present in all cells covering membrane up to the veins; veins
clothed in very short macroscopic setae. Hindwing simple, membraneous; costal setae not grouped; vein M+Cu
developed. Metatibia 0.59-0.60 times as long as head width, with well-developed genual spine and 1+3+1 sclerotised
apical spurs; metabasitarsus with two sclerotised spurs. Terminalia as in Figs. 63-66. Male proctiger slender, strongly
curved subapically, hairy. Male subgenital plate slightly elongate, hairy in the middle and ventrally. Paramere
securiform, slender basally, wide apically, fore margin of apical portion forming anteriorly extended to form narrow,
outer lobe, antero-apical edge drawn into obliquely upwards directed point; outer surface covered with simple setae,

dry and slide mounted, preserved in 70% and 95% ethanol). Host plant. Malus baccata (L.) Borkh. (Rosaceae), confirmed by the presence of immatures. Etymology. Named after its host Malus baccata. Comments. Cacopsylla baccatae shares with C. malivorella from Japan and the Russian Far East and C.
myriacantha Li, 2011 from China the shape of the forewing, the peculiar built of the paramere and, with the former,
the host Malus, that of the latter being unknown. This suggests that the three species are closely related. C. baccatae
differs from the other two species in details of the paramere, e. g. the length/width ratios which are as follows: C.
baccatae 2.0, C. malivorella 1.7 and C. myriacantha 1.4. C. baccatae differs from the other two species also in the
more inflated, subspherical apical dilatation of the distal portion of the aedeagus which is more flattened in the other
two species. 540 - Zootaxa 4238 (4) © 2017 Magnolia Press CHO ET AL. Jophorina robinae, adult male. 23. Colophorina

Cacopsylla quelparticola, Park, 1996: 272. Cacopsylla sp. 1, Hayashi & Miyatake, 2012: 39. Material examined. South Korea (JJ, JN) (NHMB, SNU). Host plant. Pittosporum tobira (Thunb.) W.T. Aiton (Pittosporaceae), confirmed by the presence of
immatures. Comments. Kwon (1983) described both Cacopsylla quelparticola and C. bibari based on a single male each
from Jeju Island. The major difference between the two is, according to Kwon (1983), the spinule free stripes on
the forewing which are ‘apparently broad’ in the former and ‘prominent but relatively narrower’ in the latter. We
collected large series of specimens in several localities on Jeju Island and in the South of the Peninsula, along with
Cacopsylla tobirae on Pittosporum tobirae (Pittosporaceae), which suggest that these differences are within the
range of intraspecific variation. For this reason, we synonymise the two taxa. As both species have been described
in the same publication we chose Psylla bibari as senior name as it is more euphonious and, thus, complies better
with recommendation 25C of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (1999). Cacopsylla sp. 1
by Hayashi & Miyatake (2012) from Japan, collected on Pittosporum tobirae, is referrable to C. bibari. Cacopsylla lineaticeps (Kwon, 1983)

as well as the host, ie. Acer tataricum L. subsp. ginnala (Maxim.) Wesm. (Sapindaceae) define this species. Psylla
ginnali Konovalova & Loginova (1985) shares these characters suggesting that it is conspecific with C. lineaticeps. This has been previously presumed by Labina er al. (2014) and we formally synonymise the two taxa. Cacopsylla nopeunsanicola (Kwon, 1983)

(Sapindaceae), confirmed by the presence of immatures. Comments. Among the East Asian Cacopsylla species associated with Acer spp. (Sapindaceae) (Konovalova
& Loginova 1985; Park & Lee 1992), two species, i.e. C. abieti and C. pseudosieboldiani, are characterised by
massive, apically truncate genal processes and by relatively broad, yellow to ochreous forewings, lacking a dark
pattern except for the dark claval apex and bearing very dense surface spinules, covering the entire wing
membrane. The paramere of C. abieti is broad subapically, that of C. pseudosieboldiani slender. Psylla koreana
Park (1992) and Cacopsylla sieboldiana Li (2011) display these head and forewing characters and, in particular the
apically slender paramere, suggesting that they are conspecific with C. pseudosieboldiani. For this reason, we
synonymise them. We have examined specimens from JJ identified by Y. J. Kwon as P. abieti that are C.
pseudosieboldiani. Judging from his description, it appears that the specimens treated by Kwon (1983) under P.
abieti are a mix of C. albopontis and C. pseudosieboldiani. Cacopsylla pulchra (Zetterstedt, 1840)

description of C. idiocrataegi by Li (1992b), that develops also on Crataegus pinnatifida, suggests that this species
is conspecific with C. sangjaci. The two taxa are, therefore, synonymised. Cacopsylla satsumensis (Kuwayama, 1908)

(Figs. 54, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79-80)

Diagnosis. The new species is similar to Cyamophila hexastigma (Horvath, 1899). It differs in the surface spinules
of the forewing which are denser and irregularly spaced, leaving only narrow spinule-free stripes along the veins. It
differs from C. hexastigma also in the host: Maackia floribunda, rather than M. amurensis. Description. Adult. Colour and structure similar to C. hexastigma. Body colour greenish (Fig. 54), yellowish
in ethanol preserved specimens, with whitish pattern on head and thorax in young specimens becoming dark brown
in overwintered individuals. Antenna yellow, segments | and 2, greyish brown, segments 4—7 brown apically, dark
portion becoming larger in more distal segments, segments 8-10 brown to almost black. Forewing transparent,
veins yellow or brown; membrane transparent, slightly yellowish, particularly towards the wing apex and in older
specimens; in old specimens also sometimes yellow or ochreous stripes along veins in apical part; with each a
conspicuous brown spot in the middle of cells m,, m, and cu, along wing margin; surface spinules present in all
cells, densely spaced forming irregular transverse rows, leaving only narrow, spinule-free stripes along the veins. Terminalia as in Figs. 75, 77, 79-80. Measurements (in mm; 3 3, 3 2): head width 3 0.92-0.97, 2 0.98-1.05; antenna length 3 2.08-2.34, 2

& D. Burckhardt) (NHMB, SNU). Host plant. Unknown. Comments. Previously reported from Korea from a single female specimen without exact locality information
(Kwon et al. 2015b). Li (2011) erected Trachotrioza for two new Chinese species, 7. beijingensis based on one male and one female,
and &. apicinigra based on two males. Li’s (2011) description leaves little doubt that Zrachotrioza beijingensis is a
junior synonym of £otrioza ussuriensis originally described from the Russian Far East (Konovalova 1987). The
differences between 7. beijingensis and T. apicinigra mentioned in the original description (Li 2011), mostly size
and colour, are more difficult to interpret. As we have not examined Li’s types, we keep the two as separate species
and transfer the latter to Eotrioza. This results in following nomenclatorial changes: Eotrioza Konovalova, 1987 =
Trachotrioza Li, 2011, syn. nov., Eotrioza ussuriensis Konovalova, 1987 = Trachotrioza beijingensis Li, 2011,

species described from Taiwan. They also transferred the species to the artificial genus Metatriozidus which was
synonymised with Zrioza by Yang et al. (2013). The ‘revisionary survey’ of the ‘four species’ by Kwon et al. (2015d) suffers from some misconceptions. Trioza brevifrons was described by Kuwayama (1910) from a single female from Taiwan. Miyatake (1964b)
reported the species from Japan though pointing out that the two Japanese specimens at hand differ from 7.
brevifrons in the longer genal processes. Later, Miyatake (1969) listed two additional specimens, one from Celtis

 

554 - Zootaxa 4238 (4) © 2017 Magnolia Press CHO ET AL. sinensis var. japonica, as Trioza sp. 1 suggesting it may belong to a new species. Miyatake (1971) identified a
single female from Korea (as Zrioza sp.) ‘as the species which the author is ready to describe from Japan in the near
future.” Miyatake (1976) listed another female (as Trioza sp.) from Japan from Celtis sinensis var. japonica. Miyatake (1979), finally, reported again T. brevifrons from Japan suggesting that the population from Japan may
represent a new species. Kwon & Lee (1981) listed 7 brevifrons from Korea referring to a personal communication
of Y. Miyatake to Y. J. Kwon. In his book, Kwon (1983) reproduced an English translation of the original German
description of T. brevifrons almost verbatim. Apparently, he has not seen the holotype nor other material of 7.
brevifrons from Taiwan. It is difficult to understand why he decided that the species should have 1+3 metatibial
spurs, a character not mentioned in the original description. There is also no information given by Kuwayama
(1910) on the host plant. Park (1996) synonymised 1 chilgia and H. noknamui, and suggested that T. brevifrons
sensu Kwon (1983) is a misidentification, probably following Miyatake (1979). Neither Yang (1984) nor Yang et
al. (2013) treated 7. brevifrons due to the lack of material. They certainly did not exclude the species from the
Taiwanese fauna as was erroneously suggested by Kwon er al. (2015b). According to Kuwayama’s (1910)
description, 7. brevifrons has an almost straight vein Rs (‘Radius fast gerade’) which is relatively long
(‘Radialstiick der Costa 2mal so lang wie das Spitzenstiick derselben’). The Japanese and Korean species
associated with Celtis has, however, a distinctly curved, short vein Rs and the portions of the fore margin between
the apices of veins R, and Rs, and between the apices of veins Rs and M,,, are subequal in length. We conclude that
the Taiwanese T. brevifrons and the triozids on Celtis sinensis var. japonica reported under various names from
China, Japan and Korea are not conspecific. The former, whose holotype seems lost, has to be regarded as a nomen
dubium whereas the latter should be named Trioza chilgia with the junior synonym Heterotrioza noknamui. Not
having seen relevant material of 7. brevifrons sensu Kwon (1983) nor of Trioza bifasciaticeltis we cannot comment
on their identity. In any case, currently there are no reliable records of 7. brevifrons from outside Taiwan. Judging
from the description of Ceropsylla celticola Li, 2011 from China collected on Celtis tetrandra, this species is
probably also closely related to 7. chilgia. According to Kwon & Lee (1981) the records of Trioza camphorae Sasaki, 1910 from Korea (Kim 1965; see
also Kwon 1983: 95) concern all Trioza chilgia. It is difficult to understand why Kwon et al. (2015a, c) list Trioza
camphorae from Korea citing Kim (1965) as source. There are so far no reliable records of Trioza camphorae from
Korea. The genus Metatriozidus was synonymised by Yang er al. (2013) for its artificial nature and not lack of
definition as suggested by Kwon et al. (2015c, d). We firmly believe that any biologically meaningful classification
of organisms should reflect phylogeny and not mere resemblance between taxa. Trioza cinnamomi (Boselli, 1930), comb. rev. (Figs. 87-90)
