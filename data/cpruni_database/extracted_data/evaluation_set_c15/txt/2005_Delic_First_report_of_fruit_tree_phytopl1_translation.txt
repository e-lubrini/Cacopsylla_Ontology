Abstract : During autumn 2004, orchards were surveyed in seven districts of north-
western, central and southern Bosnia and Hercegovina for the presence of phytoplasma
diseases. Symptoms of apple proliferation (AP), pear decline (PD) and European stone
fruit yellows (ESFY) were observed in several districts. Samples were collected for
laboratory analyses from a number of symptomatic and symptomless fruit trees. In the
same orchards, during spring 2005, vectors of AP (Cacopsylla costalis [Psylla costalis] and
C. melanoneura [P. melanoneural), PD (C. pyri) and ESFY (C. pruni) were collected and
analysed for the presence of the respective phytoplasmas. Laboratory analyses showed
the presence of phytoplasmas belonging to: (i) 16SrX group, subgroup A (Candidatus
Phytoplasma mali) in apples and in C, costalis and C. melanoneura; (ii) 16SrX group,
subgroup C (Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri) in pears and in C. pyri; and (iii) 16SrX group,
subgroup B (Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum) in apricots and peaches and in C. pruni. This is thought to be the first report of AP, ESFY and their respective psyllid vectors in
Bosnia and Hercegovina. ISSN : 1125-4653 (/cabdirect/search/? Record Number : 20053166096
