Abstract

Crop protection requires the accurate identification of disease vectors, a task that can be made difficult when these
vectors encompass cryptic species. Here we developed a rapid molecular diagnostic test to identify individuals of
Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli, 1763) (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), the main vector of the European stone fruit yellows
phytoplasma. This psyllid encompasses two highly divergent genetic groups that are morphologically similar and that
are characterized by genotyping several microsatellite markers, a costly and time-consuming protocol. With the aim
of developing species-specific PCR primers, we sequenced the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) on a collection
of C. pruni samples from France and other European countries. ITS2 sequences showed that the two genetic groups
represent two highly divergent clades. This enabled us to develop specific primers for the assignment of individuals
to either genetic group in a single PCR, based on ITS2 amplicon size. All previously assigned individuals yielded
bands of expected sizes, and the PCR proved efficient on a larger sample of 799 individuals. Because none
appeared heterozygous at the ITS2 locus (i.e., none produced two bands), we inferred that the genetic groups of C.
pruni, whose distribution is partly sympatric, constitute biological species that have not exchanged genes for an
extended period of time. Other psyllid species (Cacopsylla, Psylla, Triozidae and Aphalaridae) failed to yield any
amplicon. These primers are therefore unlikely to produce false positives and allow rapid assignment of C. pruni
individuals to either cryptic species. Citation: Peccoud J, Labonne G, Sauvion N (2013) Molecular Test to Assign Individuals within the Cacopsylla pruni Complex. PLoS ONE 8(8): €72454. doi:10.1371/journal,pone.0072454

Introduction

Psyllids, or jumping plant lice, are small (1-5 mm) phloem-
sucking insects with a worldwide distribution and which breed
almost exclusively on perennial dicotyledonous hosts [1-3]. Psyllids typically present very narrow host ranges
corresponding to low-level plant taxa, either a specific plant
family, genus or species (not considering “shelter plants” on
which many psyllid species overwinter) [4]. There are about
3,500 described species of psyllids but twice that many may
actually exist [5]. Psyllids belong to the superfamily Psylloidea,
a sister clade of all other Sternorrhyncha [6,7]. The taxonomy and phylogeny of psyllids are primarily based
on morphological characters (e.g., [8]). Extant jumping plant
lice constitute morphologically well-defined groups [9],
although, in general, only specialized taxonomists are able to
interpret certain subtle characters that distinguish taxa. This is
particularly true for the 239 known and validated species of

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

Cacopsylla [10], due to the lack of an identification key for the
genus [11]. This difficulty becomes problematic for the pests or
the vectors of plant pathogens, including Cacopsyila species
that feed on fruit trees and that transmit bacteria known as
phytoplasma. Hodkinson [12] highlighted major problems on
the taxonomic status of the various species of west Palaearctic
Pyrus-feeding psyllids. In their revision, Burckhardt and
Hodkinson [1] estimated that European economic
entomologists have generally applied the species names,
Cacopsylla pyri (Linné, 1758) and Cacopsylla pyricola
(Foerster, 1848) (described as vectors of Pear decline
phytoplasma in Europe and North America, respectively), to all
members of the complex and have failed to recognize
morphological and biological differences between the seven
known species feeding on Pyrus. Confusion is also possible
between vectors of Apple proliferation phytoplasma,
Cacopsylla melanoneura (Foerster, 1848) and Cacopsylla
affinis (Léw, 1880), which are often found together on their wild

host plants (Crataegus) or on their overwintering shelter plants
(conifers). C. pruni, the only known vector of the European
stone fruit yellows phytoplasma on cultivated Prunus [13,14],
was proved to be a complex of two genetic groups that are not
yet distinguished morphologically [15]. The difficulty to identify
economically important psyllids with traditional taxonomic
characters demonstrates the need for a new approach. DNA-based identification constitutes a reliable, cost-effective
and accessible solution to assign individuals to cryptic species. The mitochondrial gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase
subunit 1 (COI) has been proposed in the ‘DNA barcoding’
approach as the best marker for a global bioidentification
system in animals [16]. The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) second
internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) is another frequently used
marker. This fast evolving nuclear region has proved its
benefits for phylogenetic analysis within genera or for
discrimination of cryptic species within complexes (e.g.,
[17,18}). The aim of the present work was to develop a molecular
identification method to distinguish the individuals of the
genetic groups A and B of the C. pruni complex. A previous
population structure analysis based on 310 specimens from
western and southern France and northern Spain showed the
existence of two clearly differentiated genetic groups that occur
sympatrically in most sites [15]. Because no morphological
differences have yet been found to distinguish the two groups,
the only way to identify them required the use of several
microsatellite markers, a costly and time-consuming method
[19]. Consequently, in order to assign a greater number of
individuals, in particular, to determine the geographical
distributions and host ranges of the two groups, we developed
an easy and reliable molecular test based on the ITS2 region. This marker offers some advantages over the bar coding gene
COl in designing species-specific primers due to the higher G-
G content and the presence of insertion-deletions (indels)
between species. Such primers were designed to efficiently
assign the individuals to each group with a single polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and no DNA sequencing. Materials and Methods

Psyllid samples used in molecular procedures

Twelve C. pruni samples (i.e., insects from the same locality)
used in this study, mostly from France, are described in
Sauvion et al. (2007) (Table 1, Figure 1). These samples
constitute 310 psyllids (males or females) genotyped at nine
microsatellite loci and previously assigned to groups referred to
as A and B (Table 1). We aimed to increase our dataset with
14 additional samples in order to cover the known distribution
area of C. pruni to the greatest extent possible [14]. The
individuals of seven of these 14 samples were genotyped:
three samples from France and four samples from Serbia, Italy,
Germany and Spain (samples 13 to 19, Table 1). All
microsatellite genotypes were assigned to a group using the
Bayesian admixture procedure described in Sauvion et al. [15]. In all the 19 genotyped samples, two individuals assigned to
either group were selected for ITS2 sequencing (detailed
below). As outgroups, we sequenced one individual from

Molecular Characterization of Cacopsylla pruni

Cacopsylla fulguralis (Kuwayama, 1908) and one individual
from Psylla alni (Linné, 1758). Eight individuals of the 19
previously described samples plus seven other samples were
analyzed at the diagnostic PCR (see below) to test the
reliability of this test on individuals of diverse origins. Our aim
was to test four individuals from each group. Finally, in order to ascertain that the diagnostic PCR
amplified only C. pruni DNA, we performed it on individuals of
18 species of Cacopsylla, including all those known to transmit
phytoplasma to Rosaceae, one species of Psylla, one species
of Triozidae, and one species of Aphalaridae (Table 2),
according to the recent classification of Psylloidea [10,11]. Four
to five individuals per species were first amplified at the ITS2
locus using generic primers (see below), to ascertain DNA
quality at this locus. For each species, one individual that
yielded good amplification was then tested with the diagnostic
PCR. All psyllids were stored in absolute ethanol until DNA
extraction. DNA of individual psyllids was purified from whole
bodies using either the CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide) method [20] in individual 1.5 ml tubes, or the High-
Salt method based on TNES (Tris, NaCl, EDTA, SDS) buffer
[21] in semi-deep well plates. DNA was diluted in 60 pL of
water. Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) DNA sequencing
and phylogenetic analysis

The ITS2 spacer and parts of the rRNA 28S and 5.8S genes
were amplified with primers © CASSp8sFom (5
CGAACATCGACAAGTCGAACGCACA-3'), adapted by E.
Jousselin for aphids (com. pers.) from Ji et al. [22], and
CAS28sB1d (ID: S50426), specific for Hemiptera (5-
TTGTTTTCCTCCGCTTATTAATATGCTTAA-3’) [22]. The PCR
was performed in a final volume of 25 uL containing: 2.5 uL of
QIAGEN Coraload buffer (containing 45 pmol MgCl,), 0.05 mM
of each dNTP, 3 mM of MgCl, (Qiagen), 0.7 uM of each primer,
0.625 U of Taq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen) and 2 uL of DNA
extract. The PCR cycles were as follows: initial denaturation at
94°C for 3 min; followed by 40 cycles at 92°C for 30 s, 48°C for
1 min and 72°C for 1 min, with a final 10-min extension period
at 72°C. Purification of PCR products and Sanger sequencing
with both primers were performed by the GENOSCOPE (Evry,
France). Sequences were analyzed with Geneious Pro 5.4 [23]. Chromatograms from DNA sequences were assembled for
each individual and then aligned with the Muscle algorithm and
visually inspected. A neighbor-joining tree [24] was constructed
using the PAUP* 4.0b10 [25] plugin in Geneious. We used the
unequal-frequency Kimura 3-parameter + gamma model of
nucleotide evolution [26], as suggested by MODELTEST [27]. Node support was calculated from 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Primers for diagnostic PCR

The reciprocal monophyly of the two C. pruni groups (see
results) permitted the development of specific primers. We
used the Primer3 web interface (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3/
Accessed 2013 July 19) to design three sets of primers, each
comprising a “universal” primer binding the sequence of both

groups, and two specific primers, each binding the ITS2 of one
group only (Figure 2). This specificity was ensured by the
presence of indels that differentiated groups at the primer
binding sites. These binding sites were chosen at distant
positions so that a triplet of primers made it possible to identify
groups by sizing the amplicon produced in a single PCR. In the
following, the name of a group-specific primer comprises the
letter A or B to specify the genetic group that it targets. For the
first set, the universal primer was Cp480R_ (5°-
TACATCCGAGGGTCGGTATC-3'), and the specific primers
were CpA300F (5'- GGCCAGTAGTTAAACCGGACT-3') and
CpB120F (5'-TCCACGGGGTCCGCGATA-3’). For the second
set, the same universal primer Cp480R was used with the
specific primers CpASOF (3-
TTGTGTCTGTGTTTCGAGAGC-S’) and CpB350F (3'-
AATCCAAACCCCGCGATG-5’). For the third set, the universal
primer was Cp135F (3'- ATACGCGCTCGATCTGACAT-5’),
and the two specific primers were CpA425R (3-
TCGACTCTCTCGCCTCTCTT-5') and CpB315R = (3’-
TTAACCGCTGGGGCTAGG-5)’. PCR was performed in a final volume of 12 yL containing:
1.1 uL of QIAGEN Coraload PCR buffer (containing 45 pmol

MgCl), 0.05 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM of MgCl, (Qiagen),
0.2 yM of each primer (10 UM), 0.625 U of Taq DNA
Polymerase (Qiagen) and 2 uL of DNA extract. Due to the high
yield of this PCR, DNA template was diluted 30 times before
being added to the mix. The PCR cycles were as follows: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; followed by 30 cycles at 94°C
for 30 sec, 65°C for 20 sec and 72°C for 30 sec, with a final 5-
min extension period at 72°C. Amplicons were submitted to a
100V, 40 min electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels stained with
ethidium bromide for visualization under UV light. Results

Diagnostic PCR

Figure 4A shows typical bands obtained by electrophoresis
of PCR products from each C. pruni group using the three
primer sets designed to amplify the ITS2 region. For primer set
1, the expected PCR products are 172 base pairs (bp) for
group A and 377 bp for group B. For primer set 2, the expected
PCR products are 421 bp (A) and 151 bp (B), and for primer
set 3, the expected PCR products are 293 bp (A) and 177 bp
(B). The mixtures of group A DNA and group B DNA (holes A
+B on Figure 4A) resulted in two bands of the expected sizes. Eight individuals per sample (males or females assigned to
groups A and/or B based on their microsatellite genotype) were
tested with the three primers sets. All amplicons obtained were
of the expected sizes (Table 1). Seven, eight and two
individuals resulted in no band for the primer sets 1, 2 and 3,
respectively. For each sample, the remaining individuals (178
from group A and 103 from group B) were tested with at least
one primer set. Only 2% produced no fragment in one PCR,
but all of the 799 individuals produced expected amplicons in at
least one PCR. None produced two bands. The amplification

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

with primer set 2 seems less efficient for the individuals in
group B: the fragments appeared to be the faintest with set 2
than with set 1 or 3 for almost all of the individuals that we
tested. Amplification of DNA from C. pruni males and females
revealed no difference. The specificity of the three primer sets for C. pruni was
evaluated by performing PCR assays on individuals of 22 other
psyllid species. All were amplified at the ITS2 region with the
generic primers (Figure 4B), but none showed amplification
with any of the primer sets designed for C. pruni. Indeed,
amplicons were obtained only for the C. pruni individuals,
corresponding to lanes 14 and 15 in Figure 4C, which shows
results for primer set 3 (results not shown for primer sets 1 and
2). Discussion
The perfect match between microsatellite clusters, ITS2

clades and amplicon sizes demonstrates that ITS2 is a reliable
marker to identify groups of C. pruni that remain

evidence for successful hybridization or introgression of ITS2
alleles between the genetic groups often found in sympatry,
since such events would lead to heterozygous individuals. This
result indicates that the genetic groups of C. pruni constitute
biological species. Furthermore, divergence between ITS2
alleles within each C. pruni species is much lower than
between species (Figure 3). Such deep reciprocal monophyly
suggests that the C. pruni species did not exchange ITS2
alleles for a relatively long time [28]. Absolute estimates on the
timing since complete isolation would require a molecular
clock, which is not available in psyllids. The failure to amplify the ITS2 locus in other species with our
diagnostic primers probably results from mutations in primer
binding sites, which were chosen for their polymorphism within
C. pruni. In these conditions, it is extremely unlikely for an
individual that produces one band of a certain size to be
erroneously assigned. The fact that some C. pruni individuals
failed to amplify with one given set of primers may result from
technical errors or null ITS2 alleles. The use of several sets of
primers will ensure successful identification of such individuals. The diagnostic PCR developed here is a fast, cost-effective
and reliable tool to assign individuals of C. pruni to genetic
groups that appear to constitute divergent species. This tool
will greatly facilitate studies that investigate the distribution
areas of these species, their host plants and their ability to
vector phytoplasma pathogens. August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e72454

Figure 4. Amplicons from PCRs using the ITS2 primer sets designed for the characterization of C. pruni individuals. Panel
A: typical bands obtained from single individuals belonging to groups A or B, and of pools of two individuals of each group (A+B)
with each set of primers. The rightmost and leftmost lanes used a 100 bp DNA ladder. Numbers indicate the expected sizes of the
amplicons. Panels B and C: PCRs using generic ITS2 primers FCM/B1D and the primer set 3 (Cp135F / CpB315R / CpA425R),
respectively, on single individuals from the 24 psyllid species described in Table 2.
