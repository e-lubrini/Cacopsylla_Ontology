Abstract 
Fruit species are affected by severe di
seases associated with phytoplasmas. 
European stone fruit yello
ws (ESFY) phytoplasma, (‚
Candidatus 
Phytoplasma 
prunorum™), causes important disorders an
d decline of trees in many cultivated 
Prunus
 species, such as apricot (
P. armeniaca
), Japanese plum (
P. salicina
) and peach 
(
P. persica
). ESFY phytoplasma is tr
ansmitted by the vector 
Cacopsylla pruni
 and 
through vegetative propagation. An official 
survey of the presence of ESFY performed 
in the last ten years has show
n that the pathogen is present 
in several areas in Slovenia 
where stone fruits are cultivat
ed. Since the disease is not curable, the production of 
healthy planting material is regulated as 
an important preventive measure to control 
the spread of the disease. Therefore, the ma
intenance of mother plants in the insect-
proof net-house, where the infection pressu
re from outside is limited, presents a 
possibility for the production of healthy 
propagating material. ‚Virus free™ mother 
plants of stone fruits were
 planted in the protected en
vironment of a net-house in 
spring 2007 with the aim of determining 
the possibility for prod
uction of healthy, 
technologically properly developed bud wood. Mother trees from the net-house 

showed good vegetative growth with larg
e amounts of well-developed bud wood for 
nursery requirements. No vectors were capt
ured inside the net-house during the study 
period from 2007 to 2009. On control trees 
outside the net-house one specimen of 
C. 
pruni
 was caught on yellow st
icky traps in 2009, and 
a high population of the 
leafhopper 
Asymmetrasca decedens 
was found in all three years. The occurrence of 
Plum pox virus
 (PPV) was confirmed on
 an outside growing control tree, but no 
control trees were infected with ESFY in 
the three years after planting. No vector 
transmissible diseases were detect
ed on trees inside the net-house. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Production of healthy propa
gating/planting material 
presents an important 
measure to prevent the spread of diseases. Am
ong the pathogens affecting stone fruits, the 
phytoplasma responsible for European stone fruit yellows (ESFY; ‚
Candidatus 
Phytoplasma prunorum™), which belongs to th
e apple proliferation 
group of phytoplasmas 
(Seemüller and Schneider, 2004), can cause severe symptoms and decline of apricot 

(
Prunus armeniaca
), Japanese plum (
P. salicina
), and peach (
P. persica
) trees, and can 
infect several other 
Prunus
 species (Carraro and Osler, 2003). It is transmitted by the

vector 
Cacopsylla pruni
 and through vegetative propaga
tion (Carraro et al., 1998, 2004). 
The disease is present in se
veral countries in Europe an
d in the Mediterranean basin 
(Laimer Da Camara Machado et al.,
 2001; Carraro and Osler, 2003; Lavi
a et al., 2004; 
Ramel and Gugerli, 2004)
. In Slovenia, the resu
lts of the official survey performed in the 
last ten years for the pres
ence of ESFY in different 
Prunus
 spp. revealed a high 
occurrence of the disease in several areas wher
e stone fruits are cultivated (Mehle et al., 
2007; Ambroži
 Turk et al., 2008). In such conditions of high infection pressure, 
maintenance of mother plants in an insect-p
roof net-house as a prot
ection against vectors 
should be a proper and most efficient step 
toward producing healthy propagating material. 
Besides ESFY phytoplasma, the 
Plum pox virus 
(PPV), and the bacterium 
Xanthomonas 
arboricola 
pv
. pruni 
are also quarantine pests which have
 to be checked for and shown to 
be absent
 
on propagating/planting material. 
The purpose of this work was to maintain
 healthy mother plants under a protected 
environment in an insect-proof net-house, a
nd to assess the possibility of production of 
properly developed bud wood under such
 modified growing conditions. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

Plant Material, Tree Growth and Budding Experiment 
In spring 2007, peaches 
Prunus persica
 (L.) Batch, apricots (
P. armeniaca 
L.) and 
plums (
P. domestica 
L.) of different cultivars, compri
sing 81 plants, were planted at a 
spacing of 1.8 m in rows with 3.5 m between ro
ws in an insect-proof net-house of 500 m
2
 
located at the Fruit Growing Centre of Agri
culture and Forestry Service Nova Gorica in 
Bilje in the southwestern part of Slovenia. Trees were trained to a spindle form. The 

planting material had virus-free status, deri
ved from a certification scheme. Twelve trees 
of peach cultivar ‚Redhaven™ from the net-hous
e were compared with 12 trees of the same 
cultivar planted outside the net-house as contro
l trees to study the tr
ee growth parameters 
and the quality of bud wood. Tree height wa
s measured and the amount of buds for 
budding was counted on the shoots of the ‚Redhaven™ trees from both environments in the 

years 2007-2009. To check the quality of bud w
ood from the net-house trees, and to 
determine the effect of time of budding, buds fr
om trees growing both inside and outside 
were grafted at three different times at
 two-week intervals during the summer 2008 
(26 Aug., 9 Sept., and 23 Sept.). The success 
of budding was evaluated in the following 
spring. Virus-free ‚GF 677™ (
P. amygdalus 
× 
P. persica
) was used as the rootstock in the 
budding experiment. At each date of budding, buds 
were taken from different trees (three 
treatments) and, in addition, a fourth treatm
ent was made in which buds were taken 
repeatedly from the same trees at each date of
 budding. In each treatment, three trees were 
chosen and 10 buds were taken from individua
l trees. One bud was inserted per rootstock. 
The success of budding was recorded in the sp
ring 2009 and expressed as a percentage of 
bud-take. Data were statistically an
alyzed using the t-test at P=0.05. 
 

Vector Monitoring 
During the years 2007-2009, monitoring of v
ectors of quarantine diseases of 
Prunus
 plants was carried out, particularly of 
C. pruni
 (Scopoli), the vector of ESFY 
phytoplasma. The monitoring was done inside the 
net-house as well as
 outside on control 
trees using yellow sticky traps 24.5×13.5 cm, of
 the type Terminator (Bioteh, Ljubljana). 
Four traps were placed on trees at different 
positions inside the net-house and two traps 
were placed outside on contro
l trees. Each year the traps 
were set up from the beginning 
of March to October. Yellow sticky traps were replaced at two-week intervals and 

checked in the laboratory unde
r a stereomicroscope for the 
presence and identity of 
insects. 

 

Determination of Pathogens in the Laboratory 
The presence of quarantine pests ESFY phytoplasma, PPV, and 
Xanthomonas 
arboricola 
pv
. pruni
 on stone fruits (Council Dir
ective 2000/29/EC) was checked by 
 
261
laboratory analyses during the years 2007 to 20
09 to control the phytosanitary status of 
trees growing in the net-house and of the cont
rol trees growing outsi
de. Samples of roots 
were taken to check for the presence of E
SFY using two molecular approaches: a nested 
PCR and a real-time PCR. The initial PCR was performed using the universal 

phytoplasma P1/P7 (Schneider et al., 1995) with
 slightly modified primers (Hren et al., 
2007). The nested PCR reactions that fo
llowed were conducted using the AP group 
specific primers f01/r01 (Lorenz et al., 1995) a
nd a pair of universal
 phytoplasma primers 
U3/U5 (Lorenz et al., 1995). A real-time PCR 
procedure using univers
al primers UniRNA 
as described by Hren et al. (
2007) was employed to test th
e fruit tree samples for the 
presence of phytoplasma (Boben et al., 2007). 
An eukaryotic 18S rRNA TaqMan assay 
(Applied Biosystems, USA) was performed 
alongside the universal testing for the 
presence of phytoplasmas to evaluate the efficacy of the extraction procedure. For 

detection of PPV, leaves were tested using 
the ELISA serological method and, in cases of 
doubtful results, the molecular PCR meth
od was performed. The presence of 
X. arboricola 
pv
. pruni
 was examined in dormant scion chips according to EPPO 
diagnostic protocols (EPPO, 2006). 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

Tree Growth Parameters and the Quality of Bud Wood 
In the changed growth conditi
ons inside the net-house, ma
inly due to reduced light 
availability, some tree growth parameters a
nd bud wood quality were checked to evaluate 
the possibility of production of well-develo
ped bud wood for nurseries. The ‚Redhaven™ 
trees from net-house were sign
ificantly higher than
 the control ‚Redha
ven™ trees outside 
the net-house in the studied period from 2007 
to 2009 (Table 1). In 2007, the first year 
after planting, the shoo
t growth of control trees outside
 the net-house was suppressed due 
to the attack of 
Cydia molesta
 despite the applied insecticide treatments. This can also be 
seen from the number of buds available for 
budding, which was consid
erably reduced in 
2007 (Table 1). In the following years, trees
 from both environments had good vegetative 
growth, although they were significantly 
higher inside the net-house. Very good 
vegetative growth of trees growing inside wa
s also demonstrated through the number of 
buds available for budding, which 
was significantly greater comp
ared to the control trees 
in 2007 and 2009 (Table 1). Buds suitable for bud
ding are considered to be those from the 
middle part of current-year s
hoots, since shoot tips as well
 as the woody basal parts of 
shoots are unsuitable sources (Webster and Wertheim, 2005). 
To compare the quality of bud wood obtai
ned from net-house growing trees with 
outside growing control trees and to check 
the effect of time of budding, buds from both 
environments were grafted to ‚GF 677™ root
stocks at two-week intervals during the 
summer 2008, and the bud-take was recorded th
e following spring. It was seen from the 
results of the budding experiment that the 
bud-take was greater 
(84.4%) if buds were 
taken from the outside control trees compared 
to the net-house trees 
(79.4%), although the 
difference was not significant. The time of
 budding (26 Aug., 9 Sept
., and 23 Sept.) had 
no significant influence on the 
success of bud-take if buds were
 taken from different trees 
at a particular date of budding. On the other ha
nd, if buds were taken from the same trees 
repeatedly at each date of budding, the ti
me of budding had a significant effect on 
budding success (Table 2). 

 

Entomological Analysis
 
Entomological analysis of
 insects, performed in 
the years from 2007 to 2009 did 
not confirm either the presence of
 the vector of ESFY phytoplasma 
C. pruni 
or the 
potential vector 
Asymmetrasca decedens 
(Paoli) inside the net-house. According to the 
literature, 
A. decedens
 could have a possible role in 
the transmission of ESFY phyto-
plasma in apricots (Pastore 
et al., 2004). Even inside th
e net-house no other phytophagous 
insects were recorded on yellow sticky traps, which confirmed the effectiveness of the 

net-house in preventing the dis
ease transmission by vectors. 
 
262 
On the control trees outside the net-house,
 in the studied year
s, there was only a 
single 
C. pruni
 found on yellow sticky traps in the 
first April decade 2009. On the other 
hand, many specimens of 
A. decedens 
were captured on traps 
outside on control trees 
during the summer in all three ye
ars (data not shown). It can be
 seen from the results that, 
in the investigated site, 
C. pruni
 did not play a significant 
role in the transmission of 
ESFY phytoplasma in the studied period, whil
e the abundant presence of the leafhopper 
A. decedens
 could indicate it is a risk 
for transmission of the disease. 
 

Plant Health Status 
Plant health status 
of the net-house growing trees a
nd the outside growing control 
trees was controlled for quarantine pests of
 stone fruits during 
the years 2007 to 2009. 
Before planting in the spring 2007, all trees pl
anted in the net-house and 12 control trees 
of ‚Redhaven™ were checked for the presence of ESFY phytoplasma and for PPV. In the 

following years around 15% of the trees grow
ing in the net-house and all control trees 
were tested annually for these two diseases. 
A total of 137 root samples were taken in 
three years from both environments for ESFY an
alyses. In case of latent infections when 
symptoms are not visible, detect
ion is more reliable if root
 samples are tested for ESFY 
analyses (Brzin et al., 2005). The results re
vealed the absence of ESFY phytoplasma in 
tested samples both from net-house trees and 
from outside growing control trees in the 
studied period. Regarding the PPV analyses, 
162 leaf samples from both environments 
were tested from 2007 to 2009. 
All the samples produced nega
tive results, except for one 
sample from a control tree growing outside which was PPV positive in 2009, the third 

year after planting, which may 
indicate that the disease will
 spread in the following years 
on the host plants growing outside. 
In winter 2007-2008, 
X. arboricola 
pv
. pruni
 was tested for due to some 
symptoms expressed as cracks and shoot 
dieback on overwintering twigs, which was 
observed mainly on two cultivars inside the net-house. 
X. arboricola 
pv
. pruni
 was not 
confirmed in sampled tissues. However, a fungal pathogen, 
Fusicoccum amygdali
,
 
was 
found in symptomatic tissues after further la
boratory analyses. The affected twigs or 
branches were cut off, and symptoms were 
not observed on the trees by further visual 
inspections.  

 

CONCLUSIONS 
From the results obtained it can be seen th
at mother trees from the net-house had 
good vegetative growth with large amounts 
of well-developed bud wood for nursery 
requirements. No vectors were captured insi
de the net-house in 
the study period from 
2007 to 2009, while outside, only one specimen of 
C. pruni
 was detected in 2009 and a 
high population of 
A. decedens 
was found on control trees. Re
garding the plant health 
status, the occurrence of PPV was confirmed 
on an outside growi
ng control tree, but no 
vector transmissible diseases were detected
 inside the net-house. 
These results suggest 
good potential for 
Prunus
 mother plant cultivation in 
protected environments for the 
production of healthy propagating material.
