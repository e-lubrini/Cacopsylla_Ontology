pathogen ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum’ in orchards and in wild
habitats

Inferring the dispersal processes of vector-borne plant pathogens is a great challenge because the
plausible epidemiological scenarios often involve complex spread patterns at multiple scales. The
spatial genetic structure of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’, responsible for European stone

fruit yellows disease, was investigated by the application of a combination of statistical approaches

to genotype data of the pathogen sampled from cultivated and wild compartments in three French
Prunus-growing regions. This work revealed that the prevalence of the different genotypes is highly
uneven both between regions and compartments. In addition, we identified a significant clustering of
similar genotypes within a radius of 50 km or less, but not between nearby wild and cultivated Prunus. We also provide evidence that infected plants are transferred between production areas, and that both
species of the Cacopsylla pruni complex can spread the pathogen. Altogether, this work supports a main
epidemiological scenario where ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ is endemic in—and generally acquired from — wild
Prunus by its immature psyllid vectors. The latter then migrate to shelter plants that epidemiologically
connect sites less than 50 km apart by later providing infectious mature psyllids to their “migration
basins”. Such multi-scale studies could be useful for other pathosystems. Vector-borne pathogens have caused some of the most devastating plant diseases in perennial and annual
crops’. Managing these threats requires an understanding of their epidemiological cycle, particularly the disper-
sal processes of pathogens in the landscape’. However, deciphering the complexity of plausible epidemiological
scenarios poses a great challenge, especially since insects are involved in disease spread. Indeed, most of the
vector-borne plant pathogens are transmitted by small piercing-sucking insects of the Hemiptera order, whose
dispersal distances are generally only vaguely known, while searching host plants for food resources and/or repro-
duction‘. Added to this question of dispersal distance is the issue of different host plant species that insects can
occupy during their life cycle and how they move among them. In this context, a key question that often arises is
the role of wild plants as a reservoir of pathogen and/or insect vectors*"!". One of the first difficulties in identifying patterns of disease spread in agricultural landscapes is to determine
the optimal scale of the study design. Although the spatial scale of the processes has been a central question for
decades in ecology''-'* and population genetics'™'®, the development of large-scale pattern-oriented approaches
to understand the processes that shape the genetic structure of a population is recent!”~”!. The basic idea of these
approaches is to estimate the distance at which two samples become genetically independent by linking genetic
data and spatial information obtained for a set of samples using a combination of geostatistics” and population
or landscape genetics methods”. In particular, approaches used for qualitative data comprise join counts”! and
permutation tests to identify distances at which genetic similarity between pairs of individuals is significantly
higher than expected by chance?>**,

Figure 1. Eight mutually non-exclusive eco-epidemiological scenarios through which ‘Ca. P. prunorum’
might be spread in orchards. Bi: bushes (ie., wild Prunus = host plants); Ci: conifers (i.e., shelter plants); Ni:
nurseries; Oi: orchards. In red: cultivated trees, nursery plants and wild Prunus infected by the phytoplasma

or infectious psyllids; in green: non-infected plants, Pathogen transmission to cultivated trees may involve
various spatio-temporal scales depending on the scenario involved: transmission to a healthy apricot tree

bya psyllid that acquired the pathogen from a nearby infected cultivated tree ($1) or a nearby infected bush
(S2); transmission by a mature psyllid that acquired the phytoplasma on an infected tree ($3) or bush ($4) the
previous year; multiple transmissions by the same infectious psyllid to nearby cultivated trees ($5) or to a bush
and then a nearby cultivated tree ($6); independent contaminations of orchards by plants from nearby nurseries
(S7a + $7b); contaminations of distant orchards by plants from the same nursery (S8). Figure was generated
with Photoshop CS6 (https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). ‘The present study focuses on a fruit tree disease known as European stone fruit yellows (ESFY), caused by
“Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum™ and disseminated via planting material” or the psyllid Cacopsylla pruni
(Scopoli, 1763)". The phytoplasma and its psyllid vectors are widespread in Europe, including the major stone
fruit production areas where the disease significantly impacts susceptible crops, particularly apricot and Japanese
plum trees”, Rigorous sanitary control of nursery plants and insecticide treatments are currently the main
disease-control strategies, but despite these measures, ESFY continues to economically impact European fruit
growers, raising the question of the origin of contaminations. Over the past 20 years, several studies have aimed to decipher the complexity of the phytoplasma/Prunus/
psyllid pathosystem*. Two points appear essential in the dynamics of the epidemic: (i) in Europe, the pathogen
is often found in wild Prunus?“ and (ii) the psyllid vectors are univoltine and migrate twice a year between
Prunus and conifers’. In a landscape comprising different plants on which the psyllid vectors can feed, differ-
ent mutually non-exclusive scenarios of pathogen spread in orchards can be proposed (Fig. 1). Thébaud et al.? showed that the most likely path of orchard contamination involved mature (i.e., immigrant) psyllids carrying
the phytoplasma at a sufficient concentration for inoculation (e.g., scenarios 3 and 4 in Fig. 1). Nevertheless,
this lab-based conclusion has not yet been confirmed by field studies that investigate the role played by the local
secondary spread of ESFY by immature (i.e., emigrant) or mature (i.e., immigrant) C. pruni involved in either
within-orchard tree-to-tree transmission (e.g., scenario 1 in Fig. 1) or acquisition of the phytoplasma in bushes
before transmission to a nearby orchard (e.g., scenario 2 in Fig. 1). The relative contribution of natural spread and
human transfer of contaminated plants is another major unknown in this pathosystem (scenarios 7,., and 8 in
Fig. 1). Finally, the spatial scale of these processes is unknown and, in combination with the landscape structure,
this may lead to more or less complex epidemiological networks that connect close or distant ecological compart-
ments (Supplementary Fig. $1). ‘The goal of the present work is to improve our understanding of the spatial scale and ecological compartments
involved in ESFY epidemics by investigating the spatial genetic structure of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ using comple-
mentary statistical approaches that combine genetic data and geographical distances. Our study was conducted
in three French growing regions [Pyrénées-Orientales (PO), Bas-Rhone (BR) and Valence (VA)] with different
agroecological conditions and strongly impacted by the disease. There, we intensively sampled the three main
hosts (psyllids, wild and cultivated Prunus) of the pathogen. Results

Genetic diversity of ‘Ca. phytoplasma prunorum’. _ In the three sampling regions, we collected: (i) plant
samples in infected orchards (mainly apricot); (ii) plant samples in wild Prunus bushes (mainly blackthorn) at
various distances from these orchards; and (iii) mature psyllids in these bushes (Supplementary Figs. $2, $3,
Sd and $5). A total of 6,342 samples were collected and tested for the presence of ‘Ca. P. prunorum (Table 1). The prevalence of ‘Ca. P. prunorum in bushes showed that: on average, 43.3% of the samples tested positive,

from which we obtained 339 sequences of the immunodominant membrane protein (imp) gene. From the 69
infected orchards, 750 samples tested positive for the phytoplasma, and 553 imp sequences were obtained. In the
15 orchards where a systematic sampling was undertaken, 14.3% of the 1,982 sampled trees tested positive for the
phytoplasma (Supplementary Table $1), and only 4.3% of these were asymptomatic. Among 117 samples from
symptomatic trees sampled several times (at different times or on different branches at the same date), six showed
distinct imp genotypes; in this case different branches of the same tree were considered as different samples. Among the 2,572 psyllids collected from 71 different bushes, 104 (4.8%) were found to carry the phytoplasma,
from which we obtained 99 sequences. Thus, 991 samples were successfully genotyped for the imp gene (Table 1). After sequencing, we identified 17 imp genotypes where genotypes I01 and 109 were the most prevalent (44.2%
and 30.0% of the samples, respectively; Supplementary Table $2). Four of other imp genotypes (i.e., 104, 110, I11,
113) reached a frequency above 4%. Thus, only these six major genotypes were considered in the subsequent
statistical analyses. Among the 11 other genotypes, 103 had already been described in Germany by Danet et al. *°,
and [10-310 was recently described in Slovenia by Dermastia et al.’ under the name 134. Nine genotypes (i.e.,
101-104, 101-248, 101-339, 104-9, 104-175, 104-407, 104-453, 110-307 and 111-267) had never been described
before (Supplementary Tables $2 and $6). Conversely, five genotypes (102, 106, 107, 108, 112) previously described
in France by Danet et al. ** were not found in our survey. The network illustrating the genetic relationships among
the genotypes shows that most of the genotypes obtained differ by only one or two single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs), whereas genotypes I13 and 105 widely differ from all the other genotypes (Fig. 2). The psyllid vector C. pruni is known to present two cryptic species currently referred to as A and B, which
show clear genetic differences despite being ecologically and morphologically indistinguishable*”“*. All the col-
lected psyllids were successfully assigned to either species. Among all of the regions combined, species A was
more frequent (62.6% of the samples; Supplementary Table $5), but the proportion greatly varies depending
on the region, particularly in BR where this species strongly prevails (97.3%). There was no significant differ-
ence in phytoplasma prevalence (grey cells in Supplementary Table $5) between psyllid species across all regions
(p=0.52; Fisher's exact test). The proportions of the six major genotypes significantly differed between the two
species (p=2 x 10°‘ across all regions; Fisher's exact test), mainly because of the over-representation of genotype
101 in species B. For the following analysis, the C. pruni complex was considered as a single epidemiological entity
because performing distinct analyses for species A and B strongly reduced the statistical power. Exploratory data analysis. In order to explore relationships among genotypes, compartments and regions,
we performed a correspondence analysis on the contingency table of genotype frequencies (Supplementary
Table $3). Since the first two axes of the correspondence analysis explain a large part (78.7%) of the variance
(Fig. 3), the dimension reduction obtained can be considered as very acceptable to interpret the data. The main
modalities contributing to axis 1 are genotype 109 and BR bushes and, to a lesser extent, genotype 101, while the
main modalities contributing to axis 2 are genotype I11, VA orchards and PO bushes (Fig. 3b). In the PO region,
all compartments appear to be very closely related and well separated from those of the VA region. The BR region
has an intermediate profile and the three compartments were dissimilar compared to other regions (Fig. 3a). In

with POPART software® (v.1.7), and the figure was finalized with Photoshop CS6 (https://www.adobe.com/
products/photoshop.html). addition, the genotypes from orchards were genetically more closely related (i.e., segregating only on axis 2) than
those of the other two compartments, which hints at orchard-specific processes. To assess the significance of the observed patterns (Fig. 3a), we first carried out multinomial logistic regres-
sions, which revealed a highly significant interaction (p = 6.5 x 10~’; likelihood ratio test) between compartments
(ie. bush, psyllid, orchard) and regions (i.e., PO, BR, VA). Consequently, we further studied these interactions by
comparing the distributions of genotypes between compartments for each region (Fig. 4a) and the distributions
of genotypes between regions for each compartment (Fig. 4b). In the PO region, there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference (p = 0.062; Fisher's exact test) between the visually homogeneous compartment profiles with very
close values of Simpson's diversity index D (Fig. 4a). This region was characterised by a high prevalence of geno-
type I11 in all three compartments, whereas it seemed less abundant or absent in the compartments of the other
two regions (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Tables $3 and S4). The BR region shows very contrasted genotype frequency
profiles among compartments (p = 5.1 x 10; Fisher's exact test) and strong differences between the values of
the diversity index D. The high prevalence of genotype 109 in the bushes and, conversely, the high prevalence of
genotype I01 in the orchards contribute to this highly significant genotype dissimilarity (Fig. 4a; Supplementary
Tables $3 and $4). Within the VA region, the contrasted genotypic composition (p = 6.3 x 10”; Fisher's exact test)
is also reflected by the higher value of the diversity index among psyllids than among bushes or orchards. Within
each compartment, the genotypic composition significantly differed according to the growing region (Bushes:
p<10"; Psyllids: p=5.3 x 10-4; Orchards; p = 2 x 10°), although the proportion of the main genotypes for the
orchards was very similar across regions (Fig. 4b), as mentioned above (Fig. 3b). SCIENTIFIC REPORTS |

between compartments, the relationship between genetic and geographical distances was tested at all distances
using a geostatistical method”. These spatial analyses were performed independently within each region because
the above-mentioned interaction between compartments and regions meant that the genotype frequency distri-
bution among compartments differed between the three growing regions. For the PO region (Figs. 5a and 6a), the tests indicated a strong spatial structure (i.e., a statistically highly
significant excess of genetic similarity) up to 45-50km for both the orchard and the bush samples, but not for
the psyllid samples. The diversity indices D and D’ indicate that genotypes are not genetically closer within than
between compartments. For BR, the significant genetic proximity extended only up to 8km for the orchard samples and 200 m for the
bush samples, and the psyllid samples were genetically closer up to 9km (Figs. 5b and 6b). The diversity indices
D’ for the three pairs of compartments varied in the range 0.68-0.79. This latter value for all orchard-bush pairs
of samples is higher than the diversity indexes D within these two compartments (0.47 and 0.68), confirming the
lack of genetic proximity between orchards and bushes. SCIENTIFIC REPORTS |

overall genetic differentiation between samples from orchards and psyllids. A striking common feature across all three regions is the absence of significant genetic proximity between
different nearby compartments (Fig. 6a), which suggests limited spread at short spatio-temporal scales. Discussion
In this study, we used complementary statistical approaches that combine genetic data and geographical distances
to identify spatial genetic patterns that provide insights into various scenarios regarding the eco-epidemiology of
‘Ca. P. prunorum, including the role of humans and vectors and the associated scales of pathogen spread. Several results of our study strengthen previous information on the functioning of the pathosystem. Firstly,
we show that the pathogen is highly prevalent in all of the 61 tested bushes, confirming previous reports from
other European countries***. Secondly, our study provides good estimates of the phytoplasma prevalence
among French populations of immigrant psyllids (3.56.49; Table 1). Overall, this low infection rate is in line
with those estimated in previous studies with psyllids also captured in the natural environment in spring in
France, Germany, Austria and Bulgaria®®. Much higher infection rates in psyllids were reported locally in Italy,
Switzerland and Spain, but they might have been caused by specific environmental conditions (e.g., very high
level of psyllid populations in blackthorn and in untreated orchards in Swiss Valais; higher host attractiveness
or palatability, as seen for Japanese plum trees in Italy), or specific local psyllid populations as seen with vectors

phytoplasma acquisition from blackthorn appears to be inefficient. Our study also provides new information about the vectors of ‘Ca. P. prunorum: The discovery that C. pruni is
actually a complex of two cryptic species*”** raised questions about their respective distribution area and vector
competence. In the present study, we observed balanced species proportions (Supplementary Table $5) in the
PO region (59% A) and in the VA region (55% A). In contrast, in the BR region, we found almost only species
‘A (97% A), and in northern Europe species B was the only species described". The PO and VA regions may
thus be part of a contact zone between the two species. The apparent absence of species A in areas where ‘Ca. P.
prunorum is found in wild and cultivated Prunus*** strongly suggests that species B is the vector of the patho-
gen. Moreover, the present study supports the hypothesis that species A is also a vector of ‘Ca. P. prunorum: the
six major genotypes were present in both psyllid species, pathogen prevalence was similar in psyllids of species
Aand B and, more importantly, in bushes from the three regions (including BR where species B is very rare). However, an additional study is needed to compare the transmission capacities of the two species. No previous study has addressed the key question of the spatial scale of ESFY epidemics. In our study, we
unambiguously show a sub-regional structure of the pathogen genotypes and provide new insights into the main
drivers of the epidemic. In particular, we demonstrate that the genotype distribution of the pathogen in bushes

differs very significantly between the three regions (Fig. 4b), which might imply that there are few or no natural
connections (i.e., psyllid dispersal) between the three major French regions where stone fruit trees are cultivated. One of the crucial unknowns in the different scenarios illustrated in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. $1 was the
scale of vector dispersal between pathogen acquisition and inoculation. Our study shows that pathogen genotypes
are more similar than expected by chance (i.e., sites are epidemiologically connected) within a radius of 50 km
or less (Fig. 5), which explains the observed strong genetic structure between the regions, which are >100km
apart. The most important result is arguably the absence of spatial dependence between the genotypes sampled
from bushes and orchards within each of the three regions despite (i) the strong spatial structure of the genotypes
within each compartment, and (ii) the high statistical power to detect this dependence. This means that the main
drivers of the epidemic in the regions studied are neither the direct transmission of pathogens between bushes
and orchards by psyllids (scenario 2) nor the successive inoculations by infectious vectors that would land in
bushes and then in surrounding orchards (scenario 6). In the same vein, this also rejects scenario 14 (ie., bounces
of infectious psyllids resulting in successive inoculations to orchards and nearby blackthorns; see Supplementary
Fig. 1). However, this result is unexpected because this scenario seemed compatible with the behaviour of the
insect (i.e., insects flying in early spring, landing randomly and passing from one plant to another to find food,
partners and egg-laying sites). The absence of spatial dependence between the genotypes sampled from bushes
and orchards also excludes a local or philopatric version of scenario 4 in which bushes and neighbouring orchards
would be connected through shelter sites. The presence of all major genotypes in all compartments (Fig. 4b) and
the similarities in genotype distributions between compartments at the regional scale (Figs. 3 and 4a) — par-
ticularly for the PO region where more samples were collected (Table 1) — implies regional gene flows between
wild and cultivated Prunus, ie., scenario 4 is necessary to explain this observed pattern. However, this scenario
is not sufficient to explain that the genotype composition of ‘Ca. P. prunorum is more similar across regions
for orchards than for the wild compartments (Figs. 3 and 4). This observation suggests a significant contribu-
tion of inter-regional exchanges of infected plants (for planting) to the long-distance spread of the disease in
orchards, i.e., scenario 8 is also necessary to explain this observed pattern. A logical consequence is that a more
local version of this scenario (i.e., scenario 7,,,,) must also contribute to the long spatial range of the genotype
similarity between orchards within each region (Fig. 5). The observed patterns are not directly informative about
scenarios 1, 3 and 5. However, both scenarios 1 and 3 are unlikely to significantly contribute to the observed pat-
terns because they rely on pathogen acquisition in orchards. Except in organic farming, psyllids are very rarely
observed in apricot orchards because of the probable combined effect of insecticides and the lower attractiveness
of cultivated Prunus compared to wild Prunus. Furthermore, stone fruit trees are much less abundant at the
regional scale than wild Prunus, and much less infected, as shown in our study. All these factors contribute to
making this cultivated compartment a poor reservoir of inoculum and/or insects. Finally, successive inoculation
events within orchards by infectious (mature) adults (scenario 5) are compatible with the persistent transmis-
sion mode. Indeed, successive inoculation events within either the orchard or the bush where an infectious vec-
tor first landed may explain (together with the planting of infected trees) that pathogen genotypes are spatially
clustered within, but not between, compartments. To summarise, this field study supports and refines previous
hypotheses derived from laboratory experiments’ by showing (i) that exchanges of infected plants contribute to
disease spread between regions (a risk pointed out by several studies*’”), and (ii) that pathogen spread within a
region involves acquisition (mainly from wild Prunus) by nymphs and immature adults, a first migration before
the summer to one of the regional shelter hubs (conifers in altitude within several tens of kilometres), a second
migration after the winter and (possibly multiple) inoculations within Prunus orchards after an effective latency
of eight months. ESFY may therefore be seen as a self-sustaining natural pathosystem that accidentally impacts
stone fruit species, particularly in apricot orchards where ESFY is essentially a monocyclic disease (i.e., with no
secondary spread within the cultivated compartment). Such an epidemic cycle is an extremely unusual feature for
plant diseases and evokes vector-borne zoonoses like Lyme disease or West Nile fever’. ‘These new insights into the pathosystem fill some gaps identified in an EFSA pest risk assessment’, includ-
ing the origin of contaminations in European orchards. Indeed, this study highlights the prominent role of wild
Prunus as an indirect source of infection for apricot trees. Given the endemic nature of this disease in Europe in
wild habitats and the wide distribution area of the psyllid vectors”, there is little doubt that the disease cycle
is similar in most diseased areas. Nevertheless, our study does not rule out the possibility that attractive Prunus
orchards could be a significant source of inoculum in some particular situations (e.g., abandoned or organic
orchards heavily infested by psyllids and the pathogen). Given the current state of knowledge about the patho-
system, once the disease is established in the natural environment, it would be unrealistic to consider eradication
at any scale (farm, production basin, country). Disease control should thus focus on the protection of orchards
against the psyllid vectors during the key period of their return migration after overwintering, and on the produc-
tion of healthy plants for planting (in particular, by the protection of nurseries). ‘The approach used in this study could be applied to other pathosystems, especially in the case of plant diseases
due to vector-borne bacteria (e.g., ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma spp, ‘Candidatus Liberibacter spp, Xylella fastid-
iosa), for which disease management strategies would strongly benefit from insights into the epidemiological
role of wild plants or the scale of disease dispersal", The top-down exploratory approach that we applied
here can be relatively easily implemented using a single molecular marker for a clonal organism sampled from
wild and cultivated compartments and a robust multi-scale statistical approach involving correspondence and
join-count analyses. Further insights may be gained on the complex interaction network among host plants and
insect vectors by the use of landscape genetic approaches”**“ to analyse the genotypes of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ from
insects collected in and at various distances from shelter sites. SCIENTIFIC REPORTS |

Methods

Study area and sampling. _ In each growing area, we mainly sampled (90%) apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.)
orchards (Supplementary Table $1); the remaining 10% of sampled orchards consisted of cultivated myrobalan
plum (Prunus cerasifera Ehrh. ), European plum (Prunus domestica L.), Japanese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) and
peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) trees. Most of the samples were collected from symptomatic trees during the
autumn and winter of 2010 and 2011 (Supplementary Table $1). We also included samples obtained in previous
years (2007, 2008 and 2009). From each tree, we sampled 2-3 lignified shoots from different main branches. After
molecular tests to assess the presence of the phytoplasma (see below), four to six plots were chosen in each region
for a more comprehensive sampling (Supplementary Table $1). This was done from winter 2010 to early spring
2011. In this second sampling, all the symptomatic trees were sampled (thus, some trees were sampled several
times for confirmation of previous molecular analyses; see below). To estimate the number of asymptomatic trees
(data unknown at the beginning of the study but crucial to estimate the potential role of orchards as inoculum
reservoirs), one out of every three trees was also sampled (i.e., systematic sampling). Between 78 and 244 trees
per plot were analysed, depending on the size of the plots (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 2,656 samples
collected in 69 different orchards were used in the study (Supplementary Table $1). In parallel, we sampled wild
blackthorn (Prunus spinosa L.) or myrobalan bushes around the plots, at up to 30-40 km (Supplementary Figs. $2,
$3 and $4). We collected between 5 and 46 branches in 61 bushes (21 branches per bush, on average), for a total of
1,114 samples (Table 1; Supplementary Table $1). We massively collected mature C. pruni adults using a beating
tray (80 x 80cm). Other congeneric species where sometimes caught but C. pruni individuals were easily recog-
nized by the colour of the forewing, which is dark brown at the apex and brown in the remaining part. Soon after
identification, we conserved the samples in 96% ethanol until DNA extraction. Phytoplasma-carrying insects
collected several years before in the three regions were also included in the analysis (Supplementary Table $1). Thus, a total of 2,572 psyllids sampled from 71 different bushes were analysed (Table 1; Supplementary Table $1). We recorded the GPS coordinates of all collected samples, except for the systematically sampled orchards where
we attributed a unique GPS coordinate — corresponding to the centre of each plot — to all the corresponding
samples (Supplementary Figs. $2, $3 and $4). Genetic analyses. The protocol used for the total DNA extraction from plant samples was adapted from
Ahrens and Seemiiller*’. Briefly, for each plant sample, the phloem was isolated by removing the outer bark with
a knife and by scraping off the layer of vascular tissue with a scalpel. Fresh phloem tissue was then ground in indi-
vidual bags (0.5 g per bag). Alll the Prunus samples were individually analysed. DNA from plant samples was then
purified using the CTAB method in 1.5-ml tubes. DNA pellets were diluted in 100 ul of pure water. Total DNA
of individual psyllids was purified from whole bodies, and each psyllid DNA sample was assigned to species A or
B by amplifying the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2), as previously described?” No individual showed two
bands, demonstrating that the sample was devoid of hybrids or contamination between species. To select samples for sequencing, ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ was detected in the insect and plant samples by using the
ESFY¢/r primers in a specific and sensitive PCR-based method, as described in Yvon et al.:. We then attempted
to sequence the 1,328 positive samples at the immunodominant membrane protein (imp) gene locus, which
was shown to be highly variable for ‘Ca. P. prunorum™® and assumed to be present at a single copy per genome
based on the known genome sequence of ‘Ca. P. mali”°, a closely related phytoplasma (i.e., belonging to the same
taxonomic group, 16SrX). DNA amplification performed well for almost all of the psyllid samples, but failed for
more than a quarter of the plant samples (Table 1), which we attributed to the presence of putative inhibitors
like polyphenols* in the unevenly infected woody material. Successfully amplified imp DNA was purified and
Sanger-sequenced in both directions by Genewiz (Takeley, UK). Chromatograms were trimmed, assembled, and
aligned using the Muscle algorithm, and visually checked under Geneious (version 5.5) (http://www.geneious. com). Sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession n° MN116709 to MN116718; Supplementary Table $6). SNPs between individual sequences were detected, and ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ genotypes were defined according to
Danet et al. *° When previously undescribed SNPs were detected, we performed a second independent extraction
from the same sample, followed by amplification and sequencing to ascertain the new imp sequence. To represent
genealogical relationships among sequences, we used POPART software* (v.1.7) to build a genotype network
using the integer neighbour-joining (IntNJ) algorithm, which is well adapted for low-divergence datasets. Each
infected individual contained a single imp genotype, except for six cultivated trees in which two different geno-
types were found (either from different branches or in different years) and kept for the analysis. Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using R 3.4.0°*. A correspondence analysis was
performed on the contingency table (Supplementary Table $3) using the coa function in the ade4 package”, and
we visualised the results with the factoextra package”’. The contingency table was also directly visualised using the
table.value function in ade4 to uncover specific association patterns. To test whether the distribution of genotypes
among compartments differed between the three regions, we carried out multinomial regressions with the nnet
package, and we tested the interaction between compartments and regions by comparing (using a likelihood ratio
test) the complete model (including the main effects and their interaction) with the model without the interac-
tion. Fisher's exact tests with simulated p-value (based on 10° replicates) were used to test the homogeneity of
the distributions of genotypes between compartments (within each region), and of genotypes between regions
(within each compartment). In order to assess whether the sampled genotypes were spatially structured within and between compart-
ments, the relationship between genetic and geographical distances was tested at all distances using a geostatisti-
cal method based on join counts™ and permutation tests. This approach is well adapted to an exploratory spatial
analysis of epidemiological data because no assumption or prior knowledge of the processes of disease spread is
needed (e.g., relative importance of several transmission pathways, distance and direction of spread, definition

of population units)***’. The genetic distance between two samples was fixed at 0 if the samples had the same
genotype, and at 1 if their genotypes differed. This definition corresponds to the join count between elements of
different classes of nominal data”. In cases where two different genotypes were detected in the same tree, their
geographical distance was set at 0 (and their genetic distance at 1). In the case of a single compartment with n
samples, the geographical distances between the n(n — 1)/2 pairs of samples were first calculated. Then, for each
calculated distance d, we computed the average genetic distance D, between the k, pairs of samples separated by a
geographical distance less than or equal to d (i.e., within a radius d). The average genetic distance was defined as:
Di= fa,
ka

where h is the number of pairs of samples with different genotypes among the k, pairs. The confidence intervals
(here, at level «= 0.05) were obtained from N (here, N= 10,000) random permutations of the genotypes of the
n samples. We calculated the N average genetic distances within each distance d, and the lower (respectively,
upper) limit was defined as the genetic distance with rank Na/2 (resp., N(1 — a/2)) among the N random genetic
distances. A significant reduction in genetic diversity at the beginning of the curve (i.e., for the smaller radii) is
expected when genotypes are spatially clustered, and the distance at which this reduced genetic diversity becomes
non-significant indicates the spatial extent of genetic similarity among samples. Significant genetic distances are
interpreted as false positives when non-significant genetic distances are observed at shorter geographical dis-
tances (except when these shorter distances are associated with a very low statistical power, i.e., wide confidence
envelopes). Considering the cumulative number of pairs separated by a distance less than or equal to d, rather
than the number of pairs falling in distance classes defined by intervals, provides more powerful tests and more
stable curves. When d is equal to the maximum distance d,,,,, between two samples, we have:

ky = n(n — 1)
le 2

and

 

n(n 1) E'n(n, — 1)

h
Max 2 2

where n; is the number of samples with genotype i and the summation is over all the genotypes. Thus, the value of
Dy, is:
_ Xaj(n; — 1)

D=1 >
n(n — 1)

which is Simpson's diversity index. D=0 if all the samples have the same genotype, and D=1 if all the samples
have different genotypes. Since h, does not change when the genotypes are permuted, the lower and upper
limits of the confidence interval aréequal to D when d= dq, When d < dyjq,, Dy can be considered as Simpson's
diversity index restricted to the pairs of samples separated by a geographical distance less than or equal to d.

In the case of two different compartments with n, and n, samples, a similar procedure was applied to the n,n)
pairs consisting of one sample of each compartment with the statistics:

y, = a
ae
where h', and k’, have the same definition as h, and ky, except that the two samples belong to two different com-
partments. However, for the computation of the confidence intervals, only the genotypes of the less structured
compartment were randomly permuted to prevent false positive tests caused only by breaking the structure of the
most structured compartment by permutation®*. When the less structured compartment was also significantly
structured, the tests were interpreted conservatively, ie., interpreting the points bordering the limits of the confi-
dence envelope as not being statistically significant. When d= dy.) the value of D'y _ is:

1 Dt
n

D

where 1, and n; are the numbers of samples with genotype i in each of the two groups. D’ = 0 if the two groups
have the same unique genotype, and D’ = 1 if the two groups have no common genotype. Data availability
