Summary: Preventing the diffusion of phytoplasma associated diseases until now is based
mainly on indirect control measurements against the transmitting insect vectors. Apple pro-
liferation, one of the economically most important pests in European apple cultivation is
caused by the apple proliferation (AP) phytoplasma (‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’), which
is spread by the psyllids Cacopsylla (C.) picta (Foerster, 1848) and C. melanoneura (Foerster,
1848). Current control measures primarily comprise treatments against these AP phyto-
plasma transmitting vectors. The surveillance of C. picta and C. melanoneura population dy-
namics, as well as the determination of their infection rate in the field are crucial prerequi-
sites to develop suitable and appropriate strategies to limit further spread of AP phyto-
plasma. Furthermore, the analysis of the species composition of the genus Cacopsylla present
in apple orchards provides important information about the presence of other insect vectors
potentially involved in spreading AP or other diseases. During an intensive monitoring
program realized in the valleys of Val Venosta and Burggraviato (South Tyrol, Italy), the
hotspots of apple proliferation epidemics, over 13,000 Cacopsylla individuals were captured
and the occurrence of 16 species of the genus Cacopsylla was confirmed. The presence of C.
picta was recorded in more than 50% of the investigated apple orchards and the natural in-
fection rate of this vector was about 21% in a three-year average. Conversely, C. melanoneura
was confirmed in more than 90% of the investigated sites but its low infection rate of about
1% further supports that it plays a rather secondary role in spreading AP phytoplasma in
South Tyrol. Keywords: apple proliferation, insect vectors, Cacopsylla, population dynamics

1. Introduction

Apple proliferation (AP) is one of the major economical important diseases in European
apple growing regions (Mattedi et al. 2007; Minarro et al. 2016). The causative agent of AP is
‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’ ('Ca. Phytoplasma mali’; AP phytoplasma), cell wall deficient
bacteria which belong to the 16SrX-phytoplasma group (Lee et al. 2000). Manipulating the
physiology of the infected plant, linked to profound disturbance in the normal balance of
growth regulators, the disease causes symptoms on leaves, roots, shoots and fruits (Rui
1950; Lepka 1999; Aldaghi et al. 2012; Kartte & Seemiiller 1988; Giorno et al. 2013; Zimmer-
mann et al. 2015; Janik et al. 2017). The impaired quality and quantity of the yield implies
severe economic losses on the production site (Strauss 2009). In South Tyrol (Alto Adige,
Italy), the largest continuous apple producing area in Europe covering more than 18.000 ha
(Dalla Via 2013), severe outbreaks were documented in 2001, 2006 and 2011/2012 that led to
high economic losses in the region (Osterreicher & Unterthurner 2013).

38 S. Fischnaller et al. Phytoplasma are mainly transmitted by phloem-sucking insects (Lee et al. 2000; Weintraub
& Beanland 2006), but transmission via root grafts (Baric et al. 2008; Ciccotti et al. 2008) or by
grafting infected propagation material to healthy plants (Seemiiller et al.1984) has also been
described. The interaction between phytoplasma and their insect vectors is very specific:
After the ingestion of the phytoplasma during feeding of the insect on an infected plant, the
bacteria must circumvent the immune defence system of the insect and replicates inside the
salivary glands. After this acquisition and replication phase, the bacteria can be transmitted
with the saliva by the infected insect vector by feeding on other, healthy host plants (Wein-
traub & Beanland 2006). Insect vectors of phytoplasma diseases are found in the order Hemiptera, especially in
the family of Cicadellidae (Wilson & Weintraub, 2007). Until now, confirmed vectors in the
family of Psyllidae are described mainly for phytoplasma diseases belonging to the 16SrX
group, comprising also AP phytoplasma (Seemiiller et al. 2004). Cacopsylla picta (Foerster,
1848) and C. melanoneura (Foerster, 1848) are two confirmed transmitting vectors of AP phy-
toplasma (Frisinghelli et al. 2000; Tedeschi et al. 2002; Jarausch et al. 2003; Tedeschi 2004). The latter seems to have no impact on the AP transmission in Germany (Jarausch et al. 2007;
Mayer et al. 2009) and seems to play only a secondary role in South Tyrol considering low
infection rates in the field (Baric et al. 2010). Psyllid species are predominantly associated with perennial dicotyledonous angiosper-
ma and are narrowly host-specific (Hodkinson 1974; Hodkinson 2009). C. melanoneura is
described as widely oligophagous on hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) and on apple (Malus spp.) (Ossiannilsson 1992; Tedeschi et al. 2008). The dietary behaviour of C. picta is not fully clear,
yet. It is assumed that C. picta is narrowly oligophagous on Malus spp. (Lauterer 1999) or
strictly monophagous on M. domestica (Ossiannilsson 1992). Both insect vector species are
monovoltine and, as most temperate psyllid species, they disperse and overwinter as adults
on evergreen shelter plant (Burckhard et al. 2014). During winter, they undergo a reproduc-
tive diapause (Hodkinson 2009) and the hibernation of emigrant C. picta usually takes place
on conifers, whereas it is still unknown, if they feed on those shelter plants. From the winter
shelter plants C. picta (“remigrants”) migrates into the apple orchards. Beside the obligate planting of certified pathogen-free stocks and the instant eradication
of infected plants, management of AP is primarily based on insecticide applications during
vector presence (Weintraub & Beanland 2006). Thus, vector monitoring is fundamental to
obtain reliable data on their diffusion, abundances and population dynamics for the devel-
opment of suitable and appropriate phytosanitary control strategies. Furthermore, elucidat-
ing the species community of the genus Cacopsylla in the agroecosystem at a regional level is
of great interest, to provide data on the occurrence of other vectors possibly involved in
insect-mediated disease spread (Tedeschi & Alma 2007; Mattedi et al. 2008; Baric et al. 2010;
Peusens et al 2014; Minarro et al. 2016). The aim of this study was (i) to identify the species
community of Cacopsylla present in the agroecosystem “apple orchard”, (ii) examine occur-
rence, population dynamics and natural infection rates of the two confirmed AP vectors C.
picta and C, melanoneura and (iii) elucidate the presence of Cacopsylla-species mentioned
previously in the context of AP and possibly involved in the spreading of the disease. Occurence of different Cacopsylla species in apple orchards in South Tyrol (Italy) 39

2. Study sites
The monitoring was performed from 2014 until 2016 in “Burgraviato” and “Val Venosta”,
the main areas of AP occurrence in South Tyrol. The sample sites were chosen regarding the
incidence of infected trees in previous years (from 0.0% up to 20.1% infected trees/site; data
provided by “Siidtiroler Beratungsring fiir Obst- und Weinbau”), environmental surround-
ing (woodland, fallow, other crops) and coverage of different absolute altitudes, ranging
from 200 to 900m a.s.l. The cultivars were restricted to the main apple varieties in the respec-
tive area ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Gala’. From 44 (sampling year: 2014) to 50 (2015, 2016)
sample sites were investigated during the monitoring program (Fig. 1, Table 2). In 2015, two
orchards had to be replaced because of the eradication of all apple trees in these sites. Thus,
a total of 52 different orchards was examined during the whole vector monitoring program:
46 orchards were intensively managed according to the national and regional guidelines of
integrated fruit production (Agrios 2017), four apple orchards were under organic-biological
cultivation. To obtain important information on dynamics of the natural population devel-
opment, a non-insecticide treated site and an abandoned apple orchard were included in the
monitoring program. 3. Material and Methods

3.1 Field monitoring

Beat tray sampling was carried out every 7-14 days from end of February until end of Octo-
ber and 100 to 200 randomly chosen branches (one branch per tree) per site and day were
sampled. Sampling was conducted under dry and mostly wind-still weather conditions
(Horton 1999), Additionally, yellow sticky traps (150x80 mm Rebell®giallo, Andermatt Bio-
control AG, Switzerland) were placed at a height of approximately 1.5-2 m from end of
February until mid-July and replaced every 7-14 days (Kaloostian 1961; Jenser et al. 2010). AUSTRIA

(white dots) and “Burgraviato” (grey dots). 40 S. Fischnaller et al. On each sampling date the phenology parameters of the apple trees in the orchard were
recorded, following the scoring system of Hack (1992). Psyllidae caught by yellow sticky
traps were removed, cleaned from glue using n-Hexan (295%) and Aceton (299%) and
stored in Ethanol (75% v/v). Beat tray samples were dry-stored at -80°C. Specimens belong-
ing to Cacopsylla were sexed, and, if possible, identified up to species level (Ossiannilsson
1992; Hodkinson & White 1979; Conci & Tamanini 1990, Burckhardt & Lauterer 2009;
Burckhardt 2010). Dominance (Engelmann 1978) and frequency of every Cacopsylla species
was determined in the sampled area. 3.2 Molecular Analysis (Infection rate)

DNA from collected C. picta and C. melanoneura individuals was extracted using the DNeasy
Blood & tissue kit following the kit instruction for DNA extraction from insects (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). The presence of AP phytoplasma specific DNA in the samples was de-
termined using AP-specific PCR primers from Monti et al. (2013) and the SYBR-based PCR-
protocol described in Mittelberger et al. (2017). 4, Results

A total of 13,000 adults belonging to the genus Cacopsylla was sampled during field monitor-
ing from 2014 to 2016, 88.4 % of which were captured by the beat tray method. Only 11.6 %
were captured by yellow sticky traps. As females of the genus Cacopsylla could not always be unambiguously identified at spe-
cies level, for some species only adult males were considered in the faunistic analysis; this
applies to C. brunneipennis, C. elegantula, C. iteophila, C. peregrina, C. pulchra, C. pyrisuga, C.
rhamnicola and C. saliceti. Furthermore, the correct identification for C. cf. ambigua, C. of. pro-
pinqua and C. cf. pyricola is not ascertained as only females had been recorded. Due to the
resemblance of some species, a molecular tool for identification of ten Cacopsylla species has
been developed recently (Oettl et al. 2015). In total 94% Cacopsylla individuals could be determined at species level and the presence
of 16 different Cacopsylla species could be confirmed in the investigated area of “Burgravi-
ato” and “Val Venosta”. Some species were rare and have been registered in less than one
third of the investigated sites. Frequent species in the agroecosystem “apple orchard” (Ta-
ble 1) were C. melanoneura (98.1%), C. pruni (65.4%), C. pulchra (63.5%), C. pyri (59.6%), C.
picta (55.8%), C. pulchella (51.9%), and C. affinis (46.2%). According to the classification of Engelmann (1978) C. mali, C, melanoneura and C. pulchra
can be considered as the main species (index >3.2: main species) in the area. Eight species
were less abundant and only sporadically detected in the investigated orchards (index <
0.32). C. mali was the most abundant species (79.1% of total catches), but records were re-
stricted mostly to an abandoned apple orchard in “Val Venosta” (91.6% of total catches). Considering only male catches, 3.8% of total captures were identified as C. pulchra and their
presence was confirmed in more than 60% of all sampled sites. More than 16% of C. pulchra
adults were detected on apple by beat tray sampling. Occurence of different Cacopsylla species in apple orchards in South Tyrol (Italy) 41

The presence of the confirmed psyllid AP vectors was verified in almost all sites investigat-
ed (Table 2): With over 800 individuals caught, C. melanoneura was one of the most abundant
Cacopsylla species in the apple orchards. Its frequency varied from 52.3% in 2014 to 92% in
2016. In contrast, C. picta occurred in 56% of the orchards, with 147 adults captured in the 3
years. More than 90% of all C. picta adults were sampled in 2014, but contrary to other inves-
tigations in previous years, no more than 0.08 individuals per branch at one sample day
were registered. In 2015 and 2016 C. picta remigrants were rarely found, and their presence
was recorded only in 8 and 5 orchards, respectively. In these two years, no filial generation
(emigrants) of this species was caught. 42 S. Fischnaller et al. Table 2: AP vector presence and species record for each site investigated from 2014-2016. Alt. = Alti-

Absolute numbers of beat tray captured individuals were much higher for both, C. mela-
noneura and C. picta, compared to catches by yellow sticky traps (Table 3). Furthermore, only
4% of emigrant C. melanoneura and no emigrants of C. picta had been captured by yellow
sticky traps. Flight periods varied between the years for both, C. melanoneura and C. picta (Fig. 2). In gen-
eral, remigrants of C. melanoneura were captured from February until the end of April. First
emigrants appeared at the end of April, last individuals in the middle of June. Adults of C.
picta, returning from their overwintering shelter plants, were not detected before mid-March
in the orchards. In 2014 the last remigrants were recorded in the beginning of June, whereas
the presence of the emigrant generation was captured from mid-June until the end of July,
in some cases until the begin of August (Table 2: site SCH, TAR). Flight periods of the AP vectors were correlated with the physiological state of the apple
trees in the respective orchards (Fig. 3): Highest densities of C. melanoneura remigrants were
recorded during the end of the dormant status (A), but decreased drastically during first
stages of the development of flowering buds (B= silver tip, Chalf inch green). The presence
of C. melanoneura was recorded until bloom (F=full bloom, G= petal fall). First adults of the
filial generation appeared during bloom, whereas highest densities were recorded during
the end of blooming (G, H) and beginning of fruit setting (I). Due to low densities of C. picta
in 2015 and 2016, flight periods could be only determined in one year: Highest densities
were recorded during bloom (F-G), whereas first emigrants appeared at the beginning of
fruit setting (I). Cacopsyila picta_

Occurence of different Cacopsylla species in apple orchards in South Tyrol (Italy) 45

5. Discussion

The field monitoring performed in 52 apple orchards from 2014 to 2016 confirmed the pres-
ence of 16 different Cacopsylla species (Table 1). The occurrence of these insects was proven
by beat tray sampling and the use of yellow sticky traps. Most species were only occasional-
ly recorded in the sampling sites; thus, they can be categorized as sporadical or subrecedent
species in the apple orchards of “Val Venosta” and “Burgraviato” (Engelmann 1978). A previous monitoring surveillance conducted 2006 in apple orchards located in South
Tyrol confirmed the presence of 10 Cacopsylla species (Walch 2006). Considering further two
species (C. pyricola and C. nigrita) captured by Walch (2006), the occurrence of 18 different
Cacopsylla species can be confirmed in the apple growing region of South Tyrol. Our results revealed that C. mali, C. melanoneura and C. pulchra were the most abundant
species (Table 1). These three species represented 94 % of all Cacopsylla catches, similar to the
results obtained in apple orchards located in southwest Germany, where these species ac-
counted to 85% of the total Cacopsylla fauna (Jarausch et al. 2009). In contrast to Lauterer
(1999) describing C. mali as one of the most abundant psyllid species in some European
areas, we confirmed its presence in only 21% of the sample sites. In total, 99 % of the C. mali
individuals were caught in an abandoned apple orchard (Table 2: site TRS), indicating that
this species is prone to insecticide treatment. Our survey showed a relatively high presence
of C. pulchra, since this species was detected in more than 60% of the sample sites. This
palearctic species hibernates on conifers and is associated with various Salicaceae (Ossian-
nilsson 1992, Lauterer 1999). Over 16 % of C. pulchra individuals (both remigrants and emi-
grants) were caught using the beat tray sampling method (Table 1), suggesting that this
species completes its developmental cycle in the apple orchards. Nevertheless, a potential
host plant should be evaluated regarding its suitability for the insect to complete its life
cycle on this plant. Thus, feeding, oviposition, larval development and survival rates must
be determined to judge whether a certain plant can be considered a host plant for a respec-
tive insect (Hodkinson 2009). Interestingly, during the field study conducted in 2006 C.
pulchra was not determined in the sample sites (Walch 2006). Both confirmed AP vectors, C. melanoneura and C. picta, are present in the investigated
region (Table 2). C. melanoneura was considered as the main vector, until Frisinghelli et al. (2000) and Jarausch et al. (2003) revealed the importance of C. picta during disease transmis-
sion. The presence of C. picta in the South Tyrolean apple growing region was confirmed in
2004 by Wolf & Zelger (2006). Despite its status as an extremely rare species in Italy (Conci
et al. 1992), subsequently conducted surveys in 2006 revealed relatively high densities of C.
picta in the region of “Burgraviato” (max 1.8 adults/branch) (Walch 2006; Wolf 2013). In 2014
abundances were relatively low and drastically decreased in the following two years (Ta-
ble 1, Table 4), Our results regarding the population dynamics for both, C. melanoneura and
C. picta, are comparable to those obtained by previous investigations in Italy and Germany
(Tedeschi et al. 2002; Tedeschi et al. 2003; Jarausch et al. 2003; Wolf & Zelger 2006; Mattedi et
al. 2008; Tedeschi et al. 2012). In 2015 and 2016 the population densities of C. picta were
mostly under the detection limit. However, caution must be taken in interpreting the results,
as employed monitoring tools could underestimate the actual insect population in the field:
Beat tray captures are instantaneous, but are influenced by temperature and daytime,
whereas sticky traps are cumulative, but there catching efficacy is affected by the position in
the orchard and thus hamper the acquisition of correct results (Adams et al. 1983; Adams &

46 S. Fischnaller et al. Los 1998). Krysan & Horton (1991) showed a poor correlation between trap and beating tray
catches of pear psyllid, as well as sex, seasonal and morphotype-biased differences between
the results achieved with the two different methods. We showed that the numbers of
C. melanoneura and C. picta caught with the beat tray method were much higher than with
yellow sticky traps (Table 1, Table 3). Interestingly, emigrants of both, C. melanoneura and C.
picta were captured only sporadically with sticky traps (Table 3). Host plant finding by her-
bivorous insects includes chemical and visual clues (Bernays & Chapman 2007) and remi-
grants show other orientation behaviour than emigrants due to their differential host and
shelter plant preferences (Sutton 1984, Horton 1994, Hodkinson 2001). This differential be-
haviour may be the reason why emigrants of C. picta and C. melanoneura were only captured
in low numbers on yellow sticky traps but in higher numbers using the beat tray method
(Table 3). Until now, no selective and efficient trap systems are available for psyllid insect
vectors. However, they would be of great benefit to get more reliable data about psyllid
abundances. Determining first appearance and population peaks of insect vectors returning from
shelter plants are crucial for the development of an adequate phytosanitary strategy. This is
particularly important to impede the transmission of AP phytoplasma to healthy plants by
insects. According to Malagnini et al. (2010) C. melanoneura starts to emigrate when the aver-
age maximum temperature in the orchard lies above 9.5°C for 7 days. Based on these find-
ings, Tedeschi et al. (2012) developed a prediction model for the remigration of overwinter-
ing adults of C. melanoneura for “Valsugana”, Italy. For C. picta no validated prediction mod-
el exists. Furthermore, the knowledge of hibernation sites to identify triggers inducing the
migration to the apple orchards seems crucial for the development of suitable prediction
models. Despite the efforts to identify overwintering sites of the AP vectors, the exact triggers
(photoperiod, temperature) that lead the insects to leave the overwintering sites remain
unknown. In South Moravia, Cermak & Lauterer (2008) recorded overwintering adults of
C. melanoneura on Picea spp. and Pinus spp., whereas C. picta was only present on Picea spp. In South Tyrol, the overwintering plants neither of C. picta nor of C. melanoneura could be
identified yet, impeded by the evidence that psyllids effectively disperse over long and
short distances (Hodkinson 1972). This is supported by the observation that emigrants of C.
picta can be found on conifers at high altitudes in Germany (Jarausch & Jarausch 2014). Obviously, flight periods varied between years and altitude and are biased for example
due to insecticide treatments as well as weather and climate conditions (Table 3). Host plant
growth and psyllid development are essentially linked to each other and the host plant is
indispensable for the insects’ successful life cycle completion (Hodkinson 2009). The inves-
tigated area covers different altitudes, from 200 to 900 m a.s.l. and this affects the phenologi-
cal stages of apple trees. Consequently, correlating flight periods of AP vectors with the
growing stage of apple trees seems appropriate to elucidate their population dynamics (Fig. 3): High densities of C. melanoneura were observed at the end of the dormant stadium and in
the beginning of flower bud development, whereas the population peak of C. picta was
highest during bloom. In 2013 the vector control strategy was extended and an application
of insecticides of the (non bee-harming) tau-fluvalinate group during bloom was recom-
mended to reduce C. picta in the orchards. In the following years upon this measure C. picta

densities decreased, indicating that the insecticide treatment during bloom efficiently re-
duced the C. picta population. C. picta infection rates were much higher than the infection rates of C. melanoneura (see
Table 4). These findings differ from results obtained in north-eastern and north-western
Italy where the infection rates of C. melanoneura are higher and this insect is supposed to be
the main AP-transmitting vector (Tedeschi et al. 2002; Tedeschi et al. 2003; Tedeschi et al. 2012). In contrast, Mattedi et al. (2006) showed only low transmission capability of C. mela-
noneura. Mayer et al. (2009) found, that C. melanoneura has no impact on spreading the dis-
ease in Germany, due to low infection rates in the field. These results were comparable to
data obtained by Baric et al. (2010) in South Tyrol: C. picta specimens captured in 2006 in
South Tyrolean apple orchards showed an average natural infection rate about 11.1%. C.
melanoneura sampled in the same year demonstrated an infection rate of 0.6 % (Baric et al. 2010), although occurring in higher numbers than C. picta (Walch 2006). The involvement of
other Hemiptera species in spreading AP phytoplasma other than C. picta and C. melanoneu-
ra is not clear. The present study confirmed the occurrence of C. affinis, C. crataegi, C. mali
and C. peregrina previously reported to carry ‘Ca. phytoplasma mali’ (Tedeschi & Alma 2007;
Tedeschi et al. 2009; Mattedi et al. 2008; Baric et al. 2010; Peusens et al. 2014; Minarro, et al. 2016). However, a successful transmission of AP phytoplasma by these species has never
been shown. The monitoring program conducted from 2014 to 2016 revealed low population densities
of C. picta in the surveyed area of South Tyrol. Nevertheless, high percentages of about 21 %
of infected adults of C. picta in the field, as well as the laboratory-proven ability of females to
transmit AP phytoplasma to its progenies (Mittelberger et al. 2017), indicates the high poten-
tial risk even at low population densities. Additionally, the survey of Cacopsylla species
present in the region of South Tyrol confirmed the presence of other putative vectors possi-
bly involved in the spreading of AP. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate their
potential role in AP transmission in Europe and at local scale, to prevent a further spread of
the disease. 7. Zusammenfassung,

Die Eindammung der Ausbreitung von Phytoplasma-induzierten Krankheiten an Kultur-
pflanzen basiert derzeit hauptsdchlich auf indirekten Ma&nahmen, welche v.a. auf die
Ubertrager dieser Krankheiten selbst gerichtet sind. Apfeltriebsucht (AP) ist eine der wich-
tigsten Krankheiten im europaischen Apfelanbau. Sie wird von dem zellwandlosen Bakteri-
um ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’ verursacht, welches von Cacopsylla picta (Foerster, 1848)
und Cacopsylla melanoneura (Foerster, 1848) (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) auf Apfelbaume iiber-
tragen wird. Kenntnisse iiber deren Populationsdynamiken in betroffenen Gebieten sowie
die Bestimmung ihrer Infektionsraten im Feld sind wichtige Bausteine, um effiziente und
angepasste Strategien zu entwickeln, die eine weitere Ausbreitung der Krankheit verhin-
dern. Auch ist die Analyse des in Apfelanlagen vorkommenden Artenkomplexes der Gat-
tung Cacopsylla von Bedeutung, um die Prasenz weiterer méglicher Vektoren zu ermitteln,
die bei der Verbreitung von AP oder anderen Krankheiten eine Rolle spielen kénnten. Im
Zuge eines dreijahrig angelegten Monitoring-Programms in Vinschgau und Burgrafenamt
(Siidtirol, Italien), den Kernzonen der AP-Epidemiologie, wurden iiber 13.000 Cacopsylla-
Individuen gesammelt und die Prasenz von 16 Arten dieser Gattung bestatigt. C. picta wur-

 

48 S. Fischnaller et al. de in iiber 50% der untersuchten Apfelanlagen nachgewiesen, wobei iiber 20% der im Feld
gefangenen Tiere nachweislich mit AP infiziert waren. Im Vergleich dazu wurde die Pra-
senz von C. melanoneura in 90% der untersuchten Anlagen nachgewiesen. Die niedrige In-
fektionsrate von ca. 1% bestatigt jedoch die untergeordnete Rolle von C. melanoneura bei der
Verbreitung der AP-Phytoplasmose in Siidtirol. Acknowledgements
