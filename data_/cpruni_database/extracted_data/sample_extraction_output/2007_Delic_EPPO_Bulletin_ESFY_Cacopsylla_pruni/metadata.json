The occurrence of psyllid vectors was also considered. The detection of phytoplasmas in plant and insect samples and their identi\ufb01cation were carried out by symptom observations in the \ufb01eld, double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA), nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. Laboratory analyses showed the presence of phytoplasmas belonging to: (i) 16SrX group, subgroup A (\u2018   Candidatus    Phytoplasma mali\u2019) in 23 out of 25 apple samples, in 4 groups out of 18 of    Cacopsylla picta    (synonym    Cacopsylla costalis   ) and in 2 groups out of 9 of    Cacopsylla melanoneura   ; (ii) 16SrX group, subgroup C (\u2018   Candidatus   Phytoplasma pyri\u2019) in 11 out of 30 pears samples and in 2 groups out of 9 of    Cacopsylla pyri   ; (iii) 16SrX group, subgroup B (\u2018   Candidatus    Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019) in 4 apricots, 2 peaches out of 42 stone fruit samples and in 1 group out of 14 of    Cacopsylla pruni   . The presence of different subtypes of    Candidatus    Phytoplasma mali, both in apple trees and in insects, was proven.   Introduction   Phytoplasma diseases cause serious damage to fruit trees in areas with a temperate climate. Phytoplasma-like symptoms have been observed on fruit trees in Bosnia and Herzegovina during recent years. No phytoplasma expertise and detection facilities were available locally, thus other biotic or abiotic factors were usually held responsible for the diseases. Only recently has the presence of pear decline been con\ufb01rmed by PCR and RFLP analyses (Duduk    et al   ., 2005a) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Phytoplasma diseases \u2013 apple proliferation associated with \u2018   Candidatus    Phytoplasma mali\u2019, pear decline associated with \u2018   Candidatus    Phytoplasma pyri\u2019 and European stone fruit yellows associated with \u2018   Candidatus    Phytoplasma prunorum\u2019 \u2013 have been detected in neighbouring countries (Saric & Cvjetkovic, 1985; Tanaskovic & Carraro, 2003; Duduk    et al   ., 2005b) with which plant material is frequently exchanged. Taking this into account, the main objective of the present paper was to detect the presence and quantify the incidence of phytoplasma diseases in fruit trees in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A further objective was to assess the presence of the known psyllid vectors of fruit tree phytoplasmas, because phytoplasma diseases are particularly dangerous in areas where both infected plants (sources of inoculum) and insect vectors are present.   Materials and methods   Field surveys   Surveys were carried out during autumn (October 2004) and spring (April 2005). Stone fruit, apple and pear trees were checked for symptoms of phytoplasma infection. The symptoms considered were: leaf roll, yellowing and phloem necrosis for European stone fruit yellows; witches\u2019 broom, small leaves, enlarged stipules and reddening for apple proliferation; leaf roll, small leaves, yellowing/reddening and decline for pear decline. Several hectares of orchards in the north-western (Gradiska-Banjaluka),  southern  (Mostar)  and  central (Sarajevo-Maglaj) areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina were inspected. Samples were collected from cultivated apple (   Malus pumila   ), pear (   Pyrus communis   ), peach (   Prunus persica   ), apricot (   Prunus armeniaca   ), European plum (   Prunus domestica   ) and from wild myrobalan (   Prunus cerasifera   ) and blackthorn (   Prunus spinosa   ). Apple and pear samples were only collected from symptomatic trees. Different cultivars on different rootstocks from private or commercial orchards were chosen; some bordering trees were also considered. To better understand the epidemiology of fruit tree phyto- plasmas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, surveys were also carried out during April 2005 in the same areas to detect the presence of known psyllid vectors.

Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 OEPP/EPPO,    Bulletin OEPP/EPPO Bulletin       37   , 444\u2013448   melanoneura, Cacopsylla pyri    and    Cacopsylla pruni    were collected using the beating tray method. One old pear orchard was chosen for collecting    C. pyri   .    C. picta    and    C. melanoneura   were captured in abandoned apple orchards, and    C. pruni    in abandoned plum and apricot orchards. After identi\ufb01cation of the collected insects under a binocular microscope, they were split into groups of 10 and 20 individuals and kept at    \u2212   20    \u00b0   C (in 70% ethanol) for successive laboratory analyses.   Serological and PCR/RFLP analyses   DAS-ELISA was carried out to detect \u2018   Ca   . P. mali\u2019 in the apple samples, using the 1F4/1E2 monoclonal antibody (Loi    et al   ., 2001). Two procedures were used for DNA extraction. The phytoplasma enrichment procedure modi\ufb01ed by Malisano    et al   . (1996) was adopted for DNA extraction from leaves collected from different trees. The DNA extraction from insects was carried out according to Doyle & Doyle (1990). Nested PCR was employed for the detection of phytoplasmas both in plants and psyllids using the universal primers P1/P7 (Deng & Hiruki, 1991) followed by R16F2n/R16R2 (Gundersen & Lee, 1996). The R16F2n/R2 amplicons were then digested with    Mse   I restriction enzyme. Another nested PCR procedure using 16SrX phytoplasma group speci\ufb01c primer pair f01/r01 (Lorenz   et al   ., 1995) was performed, in which the PCR products were digested with the endonucleases    Bsa   AI and    Ssp   I.   \u2018   Candidatus    Phytoplasma mali\u2019 subtypes   Both apple trees and psyllid vectors    C. picta    and    C. melanoneura   were analysed for the presence of \u2018   Ca.    P. mali\u2019 subtypes. Two PCR/RFLP procedures were adopted: the method described by Jarausch    et al   . (2000) based on nonribosomal DNA fragments that distinguish the subtypes AP, AT-1 and AT-2; the method developed by Martini    et al   . (2005), based on ribosomal protein (rp) gene sequences    rpl22    and    rps3   . The rp genes-based method distinguishes four different \u2018   Ca   . P. mali\u2019 subtypes, indicated as rpX-A, rpX-B, rpX-C and rpX-D, by RFLP analysis using the   Alu   I enzyme.   Results   Field surveys   Phytoplasma symptoms were observed on fruit trees in all orchards surveyed, with the exception of apricot and peach orchards in Banjaluka where symptomatic plants were not found. The percentage of symptomatic trees was: 20\u201390% in apple orchards; 6\u201370% in pear orchards; 0\u201350% in stone fruit orchards (Tables 1, 2 and 3). The wild    Prunus    species as well as the European plum trees were symptomless. Altogether, 97 samples were collected: 25 symptomatic apples, 30 symptomatic pears and 42 stone fruits.

Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 OEPP/EPPO,    Bulletin OEPP/EPPO Bulletin       37   , 444\u2013448   In April 2005, a total of 690 individuals of    C. pruni   ,    C. picta   ,   C. melanoneura    and    C. pyri    were captured (Table 4).    C. pyri   had reached the end of its annual life cycle (overwintering generation) and therefore was not very abundant. In stone fruit orchards, psyllids were mostly captured from suckers (   P. domestica   ,    P. cerasifera   ) or from wild    P. spinosa   . In some of the orchards where psyllids were collected, pear decline, apple proliferation and European stone fruit yellows were present.   Detection and identi\ufb01cation of phytoplasmas in fruit trees  and psyllids   Using ELISA (Table 1), 17 out of 25 (68%) of the tested apple trees were positive for the presence of \u2018   Ca.    P. mali\u2019. Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 show the results obtained using two PCR procedures (with universal and group speci\ufb01c primer pairs) for the detection of the three phytoplasmas in both plants and insects. The two PCR procedures adopted were equally sensitive. All the R16F2n/R2 amplicons, when digested with    Mse    I restriction enzyme, showed the typical restriction pro\ufb01le of the 16Sr-X phytoplasma group, both in plants and insects. RFLP analyses of f01/r01 PCR products using    Bsa   AI and    Ssp   I enzymes con\ufb01rmed the presence of: \u2018   Ca.    P. mali\u2019 in apple samples,    C. picta    and    C. melanoneura   ; \u2018   Ca.    P. pyri\u2019 in pear samples and in    C. pyri   ; \u2018   Ca.    P. prunorum\u2019 in apricot and peach samples and in    C. pruni   .   \u2018   Candidatus    Phytoplasma mali\u2019 subtypes   The subtypes AP, AT-1 and AT-2, as de\ufb01ned by Jarausch    et al   . (2000), were identi\ufb01ed in the apple samples which had tested positive for apple proliferation. Following the method proposed by Martini    et al   . (2005), two subtypes (rpX-A and rpX-B) were identi\ufb01ed in the same apple proliferation infected trees. Combining the results obtained using the two procedures, we identi\ufb01ed in the 23 trees infected by apple proliferation the following subtypes: 14 (61%) AP/rpX-A; 6 (26%) AT-2/rpX-A; 2 (9%) AT-1/rpX-A, 1 (4%) AT-1/rpX-B. Regarding the positive batches of vectors,    C. picta    and    C. melanoneura   , positive results were only obtained with the method based on ribosomal protein gene sequences while it was not possible to amplify phytoplasma DNA with the procedure by Jarausch    et al   . (2000). In both vectors, the subtype rpX-A was found.   Discussion   Regarding \u2018   Ca.    P. mali\u2019, PCR was found to be more sensitive than ELISA. However, serological tests can be used for large- scale diagnosis, and PCR as a con\ufb01rmation in the case of ELISA-negative or doubtful results. The high correlation between the presence of symptoms on collected plant material and the presence of the disease agent (more than 90% of the tested samples were found infected) as well as the presence of apple proliferation-infected vectors (   C. picta    and    C. melanoneura   ), strongly indicate that the disease is epidemic in the country. The absence of strict phytosanitary controls in nurseries and fruit orchards and a widespread occurrence of psyllid vectors are facilitating the spread of apple proliferation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Identi\ufb01cation of fruit tree phytoplasmas in Bosnia and Herzegovina 447 \u00a9 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 OEPP/EPPO, Bulletin OEPP/EPPO Bulletin 37, 444\u2013448 mali\u2019 subtypes was found to be similar to that described in Germany (Jarausch et al., 2004) where AP subtype was predominant, followed by AT-2 and AT-1 but completely different from the situation in the Trentino Alto Adige region (Italy), where the AP subtype was sporadically found (Cainelli et al., 2004). Results obtained by using the typing method proposed by Martini et al. (2005) which showed rpX-A was the predominant subtype, should be considered as preliminary and need to be con\ufb01rmed by extended surveys in different apple-growing areas. Although all 30 pear samples were collected from trees showing pear decline symptoms, only 11 (37%) were positive for the presence of \u2018Ca. P. pyri\u2019. This con\ufb01rms that symptoms of pear decline are not highly speci\ufb01c and can be confused with other disorders such as graft-incompatibility, chlorosis, fungal, viral or bacterial diseases. Although only 37% of the symptomatic samples were positive in laboratory analyses, pear decline was detected in almost all locations inspected. In north-western Bosnia and Herzegovina, C. pyri was found to be infected by the disease agent. In terms of single insects, the minimum rate of psyllids carrying phytoplasmas was 1.4%. Vector control appears to be of fundamental importance for reducing the spread of pear decline. The infection rate of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in symptomatic samples was 25%, and in symptomless samples 10%. In routine diagnosis and in order to obtain reliable results on the presence of the causal agent in Prunus species, the optimal time for sampling leaves is from July to September (Jarausch et al., 1999). The rather late period chosen for our survey probably in\ufb02uenced the low-rate detection of the phytoplasma in symptomatic apricot samples. Symptom severity of European stone fruit yellows is in\ufb02uenced by the rootstock. The main apricot rootstocks in Bosnia and Herzegovina are European plum and myrobolan which show intermediate susceptibility and sensitivity (Carraro et al., 2004). This could be the cause of the occurrence of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in some symptomless trees. European stone fruit yellows is a serious problem in the Mediterranean area (France, Italy, Spain), where the cultivation of susceptible and sensitive Prunus species (apricot and Japanese plum) is widespread. Consequently, the low incidence of \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 in Prunus species in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be correlated to the limited cultivation of these highly susceptible species. Despite its low incidence, \u2018Ca. P. prunorum\u2019 was recorded in northern and southern parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Infected C. pruni were collected in an apricot orchard where European stone fruit yellows was diagnosed. Adults were more numerous on wild Prunus species and rootstocks than on apricots. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that wild Prunus species, especially Prunus spinosa, are the preferred host plants of the vector (Carraro et al., 2002). Our results desmonstrate that both the disease and the vector are present in Bosnia and Herzegovina even if the disease incidence and the level of infectivity of C. pruni seem to be low. In conclusion, we determined the presence and the incidence of three dangerous phytoplasma diseases and their respective vectors in Bosnia and Herzegovina which represent a serious threat to the local fruit tree industry.
