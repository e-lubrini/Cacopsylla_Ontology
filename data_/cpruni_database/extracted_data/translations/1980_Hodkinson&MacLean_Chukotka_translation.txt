THE PSYLLIDS (HOMOPTERA: PSYLLOIDEA) OF
CHUKOTKA, NORTHEAST USSR

I. D. Hopxnson* anv S. F. MacLean, Jr.t

 

ABSTRACT

Psyllids—small, phloem-feeding homop-
tera—were collected at five sites in the north-
east USSR. The sites form a natural transect
from arctic tundra to subarctic forest. Twelve
species were recorded. Eight of these also oc-
cur in Alaska. The tundra fauna consists en-

tirely of circumpolar and amphi-Beringean
species that also occur in Alaska. In contrast,
none of the three species found in subarctic
coastal forest occurs in Alaska. The subarctic,
high-elevation forest is similar to the tundra
rather than to the much closer coastal forest. INTRODUCTION

The Chukotka region of northeast USSR
represents the easternmost extremity of the
palaearctic zoogeographical region. Within
recent geological time this region was re-
peatedly linked by a land bridge across the
Bering Strait to Alaska, the westernmost out-
post of the nearctic region. The psyllid fauna
of Alaska is reasonably well known (Hodkin-
son, 1978; MacLean and Hodkinson, 1980,
this volume) as are those of Northern Europe
and northwest Siberia (Loginova, 1964;
Klimaszewski, 1973). This paper fills a geo-
graphical gap in our knowledge of the distri-
bution of boreal psyllid species and provides
evidence for faunal connections in the past
across the Bering land bridge (see also Hod-
kinson, 1980). Collections were made at coastal tundra
sites at Chaun Bay Station and Pevek on
Chaun Bay, an inland shrub tundra site at
Kiperveem and two taiga forest sites, one in
Snow Valley (Snezhnaya Dolina), near Maga-
dan, the other at Aborigen, near tree line in
the Kolyma Highlands (Figure 1). Collections
at Pevek, Kiperveem, and Snow Valley were
made during brief visits to the sites and are
probably not complete; collections at Abori-
gen and Chaun Bay sites of biological field sta-
tions operated by the Institute of Biological
Problems of the North, USSR Academy of
Sciences, were made over a number of days in
a variety of habitats and are more nearly com-
plete records for these sites. SPECIES RECORDED

Table 1 summarizes the known distribution
of Chukotkan psyllids. The species are cate-
gorized into faunal elements in Table 2. The
fauna includes six species of circumpolar dis-
tribution, three amphi-Beringean species
known only from Chukotka and Alaska, and
three palaearctic species. The two sites with
reasonably complete collections, Chaun Bay
and Aborigen, each produced six species, four

of which are common to the two sites. Al-
though the collection from Pevek may not be
complete, the apparent reduction in species
from Chaun Bay to Pevek is consistent with
our observations in arctic Alaska (MacLean
and Hodkinson, 1980, this volume). All of the species found at the three tundra
localities, and five of the six species from
Aborigen, are either circumpolar or amphi-

Beringean in distribution. Thus, overlap in
species between northern Chukotka and
Alaska is very high, an observation already
made at the level of genus by Hodkinson
(1980). MacLean et al. (1978) recorded soil
Acari and Collembola at the Chaun Bay sta-
tion, and found a similar high degree of over-
lap with the Alaskan fauna. In contrast, none
of the three psyllid species found in the coastal

forest near Magadan was found at any of the
other collecting locations in Chukotka, nor
have any been recorded in Alaska, although
Psylla betulae does occur in more southerly
areas of North America. The high-elevation
(ca. 500 to 1242 m) forest site at Aborigen is
more similar in its psyllid fauna to the arctic
tundra than it is to the coastal forest near
Magadan. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
