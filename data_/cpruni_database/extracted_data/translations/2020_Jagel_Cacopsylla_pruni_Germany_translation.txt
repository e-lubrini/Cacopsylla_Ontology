From May 2018 to July 2019, flora, fauna and funga were recorded on a 0.5 ha large orchard on
Schattbachstrasse in Bochum-Querenburg/Laer. The list of species should serve as the basis for being able to
analyze changes in the number of species and their composition in a later investigation. These changes are made
by transforming the fallow grassland with occasional grazing and mowing (twice per year) into a tall oatgrass
meadow in the sense of a "historic meadow'. A total of 710 species were identified, including 183 plant species
(168 vascular plants, 13 mosses, 2 algae), 32 fungus species, 13 lichen species and 482 animal species. In the
case of animals, the focus was on insects (400 species), in particular the proportion of pollinators (158 species,
40%). Due to the transformation process from grassland into a flowery meadow, positive changes are most likely
to be expected in this group. The pollinators are analyzed with regard to their flower visits and the most important
plant species on which they were observed. In addition to the fruit trees, five herbaceous species (Senecio
jacobaea, Heracleum sphondylium, Daucus carota, Anthriscus sylvestris and Cirsium arvense), each with 20 or
more different pollinators, turned out to be the most visited species. Pollination is dominated by 38%
hymenoptera species, followed by the true flies (Diptera, 26%), beetles (Coleoptera, 18%) and butterflies
(Lepidoptera, 18%). The proportions of the endangered species with 9 (1.7 %) (additionally 9 species from the
pre-warning list) and the Neobiota with 32 species (4.5 %, 19 neophytes, 10 of which are volatile, and 13 animal
species) are relatively low. The selected development measures of the meadow, which in addition to mowing also
include sowing, are explained and number of species and prospects of success are also discussed against the
background of climatic changes. contents

1 Introduction

If you deal with orchards, you inevitably come across statements like 'orchards
are among the most species-rich habitats in Central Europe" and there are numbers of species
from 3000 (e.g. B. MUNLV 2009, HINTERMEIER & HINTERMEIER 2017, INGENHORST 2019) or
even 5000 (e.g. B. KONIGS 2017, BUND NIEDERSACHSEN 2016). exact species lists,
which support these figures and in which all groups of species are listed apparently exist
not, so there are no comparative values. The numbers mentioned are based on most
of today's orchards can hardly be reached in their current state. In 2017, the two first authors planned a grazing and
otherwise unkempt meadow under fruit trees in Bochum's Siden into a classic one
two-sheared smooth oat meadow to transfer, which due to their botanical diversity and the
abundance of flowers is particularly attractive for pollinating insects. The meadow is in
Owned by the city of Bochum and was leased by the BUND Bochum in 2015,

but until then only considered with regard to welfare. Since at the planned
development of the meadow, sowing should also take place, the question arose right at the beginning
what is the best way to measure the success of such care measures. So became
decided to capture not only the plants but also the fungi, lichens and animal species, too
driven by curiosity. how many species were already present in the orchard. The determination of the species inventory of the meadow should serve to identify the changes in the
to be able to check the fauna at a later date. It was between
Mapped May 2018 and July 2019. Even if not all taxa found down to species level

se planted, three trees (quince, mirabelle plum, cherry) were planted in 2016,
a pear in 2019. In the case of a plum tree, the rootstock is cherry plum (Prunus

Hawthorn (Crataegus spec.) and two 18-20 m tall spruces (Picea abies, Fig. 2 & 3). In 2015, BUND Bochum cut down a hedge on the western border

Ilex aquifolium, Rosa canina, Sambucus nigra, S. racemosa, Viburnum opulus). close your door
At the border of a footpath, look at some large planted trees: sycamore (Acer
pseudoplatanus), English oak (Quercus robur) and field elm (U/mus minor). Soil is Léss Uber Carboniferous solid-
rock. The clayey silt soil type causes a very high effective field capacity
(Storage capacity for plant-available soil water), which is a relatively good
water supply for the plants even in dry periods. Together with one
great rooting depth and a high cation exchange capacity, this results in
an overall high soil quality (GEOLOGISCHER SERVICE NRW 2019). However is
the soil has been anthropogenically over-formed, since it is not just the foundations of the house that are here
are in the ground, but during the demolition apparently also trimmers of the house Uber parts of the
Flat were distributed. The pH value therefore indicates after measurement with the Hellige pH meter
very different values ​​in different places. In the area of ​​​​the house foundation and
in the northern part the values ​​are between pH 6-7, in the south a pH value was higher
measured in the acidic range around 4-5, under the spruce the pH value is even lower. 3 Nursing measures and development goals

Care

The aim of the maintenance measures, apart from the zoning, is the development of a species-
rich smooth oat meadow (Dauco-Arrhenatheretum), as it used to be in the lowlands of North Rhine-
widespread in Westphalia (FOERSTER 1983, VERBUCHELN 1992, DIERSCHKE 1997,
NETZKE 2011). This company became the first “Plant Company of the Year” in 2019
chosen (TISCHEW & al. 2018, UNTERLADSTETER 2020). Due to the border location of the
search area to the low mountain range, montane elements such as e.g. the meadow
Kummel (Carum carvi, HUMPERT 1887: "generally widespread") or lady's mantle (A/chemilla
vulgaris agg., HUMPERT 1887: "Alchemilla vulgaris: [...] not common") appear in it. The maintenance measures took place from the summer of 2017 as a two-barreled mowing. The mowing finds —
as far as time permits — with a scythe (Fig. 4). Remaining areas are marked with a
Bar mower mowed to complete mowing at a reasonable time. At everyone
A part of the area is left out during mowing and only during the following mowing, partly during the
Mowing the next day, cut again. Such flats are available from year to year
different places in order not to damage the meadow in its development (cf. MULLER &
Bosshard 2010). The grass cuttings are left on the field for a few days so that
Diaspores can fall out. A part of the cuttings is disposed of via a container. Since
From the spring of 2019, the material from the fenced area will be dried (here
if it is not contaminated by gauze and dog excrement) on haylofts (Fig. 5). The hay will

search area, this is currently the case around the beginning of June due to climate change (cf. WIDEN
2004). Phanologically oriented mowing has the advantage over fixed-term mowing
that the course of the weather in the spring is taken into account and that the hay is
obtained at the optimal time in terms of seed maturity and feed value
(DROBNIK & POSCHLOD 2011). The mowing period lasts about three to four weeks
there. The autumn mowing is carried out more flexibly between mid-September and the beginning of October

Table hairy bittercress (Cardamine hirsuta) or Cuban spinach (Claytonia

Within the plants, the vascular plants take 92% compared to the mosses (7%).
and algae (1%) make up by far the largest part (Tab. 1 & 2). Conifers and ferns are
represented by two species each: spruce (Picea abies) and yew (Taxus baccata) or Horsetail (Equisetum arvense) and Lady Fern (Athyrium filix-femina). Species that, as part of the meadow development that has already been initiated, by seeding or

bees (Apidae) dominate with 29 species. The vast majority of them are poly

39 species of bugs have been identified, 14 of which are (predominantly) predatory and

the soft bugs (Miridae). Most species are polyphagous, but some species are on

oleraceum, Fig. 70) for cruciferous plants (Brassicaceae, but was also used on the orchard

on sweet grasses (Poaceae): Amblytylus nasutus, Megaloceroea recticornis, Aelia acuminata,
Notostira elongata, Pachytomella parallela and Stenodema laevigata (information according to
WACHMANN & al. 2004, 2007, 2008)

Cicadas were predominantly collected by net trapping. 31 species were identified
of which 26 (84%) are dwarf planthoppers (Cicadellidae). Neozoa were not detected. 13 species (42%) can be considered typical for meadows (or Greenland) are considered, such as B.
the meadowfoam planthopper (Philaenus spumarius, Fig. 75). The other species are predominantly
bound to Gehdlze (MUHLETALER & al. 2019), such as B. the leopard leafhopper
(Typhlocyba quercus, Fig. 76) and the firehopper (Zygina flammigera,
fig 77). The majority of the species is polyphagous, the forest

When maintenance and development measures are planned, there are often discussions
between the various interest groups, which measures and how often
and on which dates should be elected in order to achieve which goal. Often
the zoological position dominates, also because species groups are in the planning area

the area is mowed* by the competent authorities without professional conditions, because
this appears to be less time consuming and less expensive than a targeted one

have different flora and fauna. When selecting the development measures for the orchard on Schattbachstrasse
we were not subject to any constraints, since no species were known at the beginning of the project,
to which care had to be coordinated. The decision fell on the development

At the beginning of the maintenance measures, the meadow was to be classified as eutrophic fallow land. It was dominated by overweight grazers, was densely matted due to lack of mowing,
wisely a 10-15 cm layer of moss covered the ground between the grazers. Various types indicated an omission, e.g. B. Large nettle (Urtica dioica) and
ground elder (Aegopodium podagraria). Areas with flowering herbs were only isolated
represented and were often shaped only by individual species. But as the species list of Gefa plants shows, the orchard is on the Schattbachstrake

only to emphasize that there are "very many species", which means for orchards,
which are managed and cared for in a traditional way, certainly applies. to the
potentially already high numbers of species in a well-developed smooth oat meadow
an orchard also add the species that are directly or indirectly affected by the presence
because the trees hang down. These include e.g. B. Species by tree as habitat

but are traditionally dovetailed with the structural variety in the rural area

affect biodiversity (cf. STEFFAN DEWENTER 2001). A number of animal species depend
not directly from the meadow plants or fruit tree species, but from the
Edge structures as habitat. It therefore belongs to the fauna of an orchard in the
historical sense. Against the background that many orchards today but in the undergrowth
("Underuse") a poorly or incorrectly maintained meadow or have an ornamental lawn,
the idea of ​​a species number of 5000 is absurd (cf. also UNTERLADSTETTER 2018). There are exact numbers of species with lists of groups of organisms that reach such numbers
apparently not yet from at least one single area. Clues to the number of species
selected groups of organisms on orchards can be found e.g. B. RUHL (1978), MADER
(1982), MOHR et al. (1992), KORNPROBST (1994), BUNGER & KOLBACH (1995), SSYMANK
(2000), ACID (2016). Although orchards at the moment in official and voluntary nature conservation as well

figures are available. Reasons for this are probably to be found in the fact that it is becoming increasingly difficult

on the other hand, more and more zoological species lists are being made using DNA barcoding
