A nod to the Hémipteéres in the Faculty Park
from Gembloux

by Jean-Yves BAUGNEE™

Summary

A list of Hemiptera, observed from 1999 to 2003 in the park of the Faculty
University of Gembloux, is presented. One hundred fifty-six species are
reported, i.e. 11 psyllids, 62 Auchenorhynchans and 83 Heteroptera. The occurrence of
10 species is documented for the first time in Belgium: the psyllid Cacopsylla
brunneipennis (Edwards leafhopper), Alebra coryli Le Quesne, Edwardsiana
plurispinosa (Wagner), Empoasca affinis Nast, Eupteryx artemisiae (Kirschbaum),
Eupteryx florida Ribaut, Placotettix taeniatifrons (Kirschbaum), Ribautiana debilis
Douglas, Zyginella pulchra Loew and the mirid Europiella decolor (Uhler). The presence
leafhoppers Eupteryx zelleri (Kirschbaum), Idiocerus herrichii (Kirschbaum) and
Lindbergina aurovittata (Douglas) is confirmed. Keywords: Hemiptera, Heteroptera, Auchenorhynchae, Psyllids, botanical garden,
faunistic, Belgium. Introduction

Since 1999, we have been making episodic observations of the entomofauna of the
Park of the University Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of Gembloux (province
from Namur; U.T.M. : FS 2002). Extending over twenty hectares, this estate
is located on the silty plateau of Hesbaye, at an average altitude of
160m. It revolves around the old abbey and more recent buildings, which
have housed the institution since 1860 (Anonymous, 1997). The park, very heterogeneous in its
spatial structure, today shelters a great diversity of biotopes both
artificial (greenhouses, buildings, walls) than semi-natural (orchard, old trees,
hedges, fallow land, ponds, etc.). If the site hosts many ornamental plants,
native species are also well represented. The greatest diversity
is concentrated in the botanical garden (more than 150 plant families), in which
we have also made most of our observations. Among the taxonomic groups more specifically sought are the
Hemiptera, whose inventory is presented below. These insects meet
generally abundant, whether in terrestrial or aquatic environments,
but their existence most often goes unnoticed. It must be said that with a size
often reduced to a few millimeters, a delicate body, discreet mores and
neutral colors, the Hemiptera have often been neglected by entomologists, if
although their regional diversity is still partially unknown. They constitute
nevertheless good indicators of the biological diversity of the environments because they are, for
most of them, closely related to plants, often with a food specialization
more or less strict. This is how all Auchenorhynchae (leafhoppers and allies)

and Sternorhynchuses (aphids, psyllids, a.o. ), often grouped under the term
of Homoptera, are exclusively phytophagous (sap suckers). At the
Heteroptera, or bugs, the diet is more varied and we meet as many
phytophagous than predatory or mixed-diet species. Although still fragmentary, our census brings together several elements
rare, even new for the Belgian fauna, whose presence deserves, in our opinion,
to be noted and commented on. This is all the more motivated as parks and gardens
of our country have only very rarely been inventoried so far in terms of
entomological. List of Hemiptera observed

Hemiptera species observed from 1999 to 2003 are presented in the
Table 1. The main collection method has been sight hunting, but nets and
Japanese umbrellas were also used on certain occasions. The
observations took place mainly during the summer period and are distributed
over a total of fifteen days. In this table, we have also specified the number of occurrences (N. ok. ), the
total number of specimens caught or observed (N. ex. ), month(s) of observation and
finally the plants on which the insects were noted (plant-hdetes sensu lato). The taxa considered in this work as non-indigenous, i.e. related

Discussion

This inventory was established during irregular surveys,
carried out mainly by hunting by sight or with a net, by a single person,
over a period of four years. However, the results were more
encouraging with the discovery of at least 10 Hemiptera new to the
Belgian fauna, as well as several other species considered rare or whose
presence in the country had yet to be confirmed. Table 2: Comparative diversity of groups of Hemiptera identified in the Parc de la

The specific diversity of the families of Hemiptera identified is quite variable
(Table 2). Some are surprisingly well represented, such as the family of
Anthocoridae with 11 species (1/3 of Belgian fauna! ), to which we could

even add 3 others, namely Anthocoris gallarumulmi (De Geer), Anthocoris
simulans Reuter and Xylocoris galactinus (Fieber) observed in the vicinity
immediate to the park. As predators, these bugs are probably there
favored by the abundance of their usual prey (aphids, mites, etc.),
a phenomenon that is moreover frequently encountered in (peri-)urban sites. Among the leafhoppers, the diversity of the genus Eupteryx is to be emphasized more
especially: the site contains at least 7 species, including two new to the
country and a third confirmed, out of a total of 16 taxa cataloged by Van Stalle
(1989). “Sources for Belgium: Baugnée et al. 2002 (Psylloidea); Van Stalle 1989 and data
later published (Auchenorrhyncha); Baugnée and a/. 2003 (Heteroptera). 10 J.Y. Baugnee

Conversely, entire families were not noted (Cixiidae, Membracidae,
Aradidae, Cydnidae, Berytidae, Scutelleridae, etc. ), others have only very
few representatives (a.a. Delphacidae, Tingidae, Lygaeidae, ...). Likewise, none
aquatic or rivular bugs (except a species of Gerridae) were not found but
these insects have, to tell the truth, not been specially sought. Certain species are linked more or less strictly to cultivated plants;
they are observed only very occasionally outside parks and gardens and
are therefore not considered indigenous. Eupteryx artemisiae (on Artemisia
abrotanum), Eupteryx zelleri (on Lamiaceae), Opsius stactogalus (on Tamarix spp. ),
Europiella decolor (on Artemisia abrotanum) and Orsillus depressus (on
Cupressaceae) are in this case: they are southern elements that take advantage of
plantations of their respective feeder plants, while also probably being
favored by the effects of global warming. As for the northern leafhopper
American Graphocephala fennahi, introduced in the middle of the 20th century (Synave,
1977), it is now widely distributed on rhododendrons grown in
Belgium. Specific comments

Cacopsylla brunneipennis (Edwards) [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 1 9, 11.viii.2001 (det. & coll. D. Burckhardt); 2 9, 9.viii.2003. Species widely distributed in Europe (Ossiannilsson, 1992, e.a.) being added
without great surprise to the 64 Psylloidea reported so far in Belgium (Baugnée and
al., 2002). It is univoltine, lives on Salix spp. and presents a cycle of
very short spring development, the imagos quickly leaving their plants-
hdtes to take refuge on conifers (Lauterer & Malenovsky, 2002). Kelisia sabulicola Wagner

Material: 1 3’, 9.viii.2003; 1d 1 2, 15.ix.2003. This species related to the sand sedge Carex arenaria has been reported recently from
Belgium in the maritime district (Baugnée, 2004). It is a Delphacidae largely
distributed on the coast of different European countries: British Isles, Netherlands,
Scandinavia, France, etc.. (Le Quesne, 1960; Gravestein, 1976; Ossiannilsson,
1979; Giustina & Remane, 2001). Its discovery in the botanical garden of
Gembloux is quite surprising since the host plant of the insect is not there.
represented only in the form of a massif of one square meter at most! Alebra coryli Le Quesne [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 1 of 4 9, 9.viii.2003; 1 3 1 9, 15.viii.2003. Species described from England (Le Quesne, 1977), rediscussed more recently by
Dworakowska (1993) and currently reported from several other European countries:
Netherlands, France (Ardennes, a.o. ), Germany, Switzerland, Poland (Nast, 1987;
Guistina & Remane, 2001; Nickel & Remane, 2002). monophagous leafhopper on
Corylus spp., producing a single annual generation and overwintering in the
embryonic. Aguriahana stellulata (Burmeister)

Material: 1 ex., 11.viii.2001 (not rec.). Eurosiberian species appearing rare or at least very discreet in Belgium. It was reported in the past in two localities in the Brussels region (Uccle and Jette)
(Maréchal et a/., 1930; Fagel, 1949). The file of H. Synave (deposited at the I.R.S.N.B.) also mentions "Miss". More recently, we captured her in Angleur, in
the moor of Streupas. In total, this is only 5 data points for the territory! Good

large, its range is not continuous. For France, Ribaut (1936)
specifies that this leafhopper seems to exist almost exclusively in the northeast of the
country. It is a monovoltine species that overwinters in the egg stage. She lives
mainly on Tilia spp. but also on other hardwood species (Betula, e.a). Edwardsiana plurispinosa (Wagner) [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 1 3, 9.viii.2003; 1 4, 15.viii.2003. European species, once considered a variety of E. lethierryi (Edwards), and
raised to specific rank by Wilson & Claridge (1999) who indicate it from France,
Germany and Great Britain. However, as these authors point out, this
distribution must be much wider. It is a bivoltine leafhopper living on
Alnus glutinosa and Corylus avellana. Empoasca affinis Nast [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 1 3, 15.ix.2003. Little-known Euro-Siberian species, mainly reported from central and eastern Europe:
Germany, Poland, former Czechoslovakia, Russia, Austria, Hungary, Ukraine,
Moldova (Nast, 1987). Its presence has also been established with certainty in France,
in the Paris region, by Giustina (1989). It lives on various plants
shrubby and herbaceous, with no apparent specialization (Nickel & Remane, 2002),
often mixed with E. decipiens Paoli and E. pteridis (Dahlbom). The male imago
is quite easily distinguished from other Empoasca by the flared and tapered end
appendages of the lobes of the pygophore. Possible confusion with E. pteridis
when the appendages are examined from certain angles, but these show
in this species a narrow preapical tooth and the anal tube appears much more
bulky (cf. Guistina, 1989). Eupteryx artemisiae (Kirschbaum) [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 2 9, 27.vi.2001; 5 3 2 9, 25.vii.2003. European species not reported to date in Belgium where its presence is hardly
surprising since it is noted in several neighboring countries: Netherlands
(Gravestein, 1976), the British (Le Quesne & Payne, 1981) and Germany (she
is considered to be highly threatened there, cf. Nickel & Remane, 2002). More at
north, it is found as far away as Sweden and Denmark (Ossiannilsson, 1981). By
However, its occurrence on French territory indicated by Dworakowska (1970) has
not been confirmed (Giustina, 1989). It is a leafhopper closely related to Artemisia
abrotanum and A. maritima, which develops in two annual generations and
overwinters in the egg stage. Note that the aedeagus of individuals captured at Gembloux
has certain affinities with that of E. semipunctata (Fieber), a taxon from Europe
eastern (cf. Dworakoswka, 1970: figures 21-22). Eupteryx florida Ribaut [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 7 48 ©, 9.viii.2003; 20 39, 15.ix.2003. Holo-Mediterranean species distributed as far away as Great Britain and Germany
(Le Quesne & Payne, 1981; Nickel & Remane, 2002), mentioned here for the
first time in Belgium, at least under this name because it was formerly confused in the
literature with E. collina (Flor) (cf. Giustina, 1989, and others). However, she is fine
characterized by the radial rib of the homelytra which penetrates deeply into the
black spot posterior to the waxy area as well as by the unique shape of the aedeagus of the
male. This leafhopper develops on various Lamiaceae and in particular Melissa
officinalis, on which we have observed it in numbers, not only a
Gembloux but also in the parental garden located in Grand-Leez. She hibernates
at the egg stage and generally has two generations per year. 12 J.Y. Baugnee

Eupteryx zelleri (Kirschbaum) [Belg. not. sp. ?] Material: 1 9, 4.viii.2003. In Belgium, this Mediterranean species was reported by Fagel (1949) on the basis
of a female captured at Jette on 2.ix.1923 by G. Vreurick (in coll. I.R.S.N.B.). This
individual, subsequently identified as E. zelleri var. decussata Ribaut and
E. stachydearum (Harris), has recently been re-examined: it is, in our opinion,
of. Melissae Curtis. The design of the head is similar to that of E. stachydearum,
with posterior patch of vertex broad and slightly notched; but the rib
radial of the homelytra is not covered by the brown color behind the waxy area
(cf. Ribaut, 1936). The scutellum bears at the base two triangular black spots, which
are only exceptionally present in E. zelleri. On the other hand, the anteclypeus
is fully browned. The imago of the real E. zelleri can be recognized by its ornate vertex,
in both sexes, 4 small rounded black spots, the posterior pair
can however be (rarely) merged, hence possible confusion with
other Eupteryx. This rectification made, the capture of Gembloux would represent
therefore the first certain occurrence of the species on Belgian territory. In France
E. zelleri is very abundant in the South (Ribaut, 1936) and goes back quite far in
the north, reaching at least the Paris region (Giustina, 1989). However, she does
default in Germany, the British Isles, the Netherlands and the
more northern regions (Nast, 1987). The species lives on the Lamiaceae (Salvia,
Ballota, etc.). Idiocerus herrichii (Kirschbaum)

Material: 1 3, 16.ix.2003. This species, widely distributed in the western Palearctic region, is
generally considered rare in various countries. This is the case in Germany,
or it is classified as vulnerable on the national red list (Nickel & Remane,
2002). In the Netherlands, only two very old captures and two more
are known (Bieman & Rozeboom, 1993). In France, the insect is not
reported only in 6 rather southern departments (Ribaut, 1952). The first (and
unique) Belgian indication goes back to Van Stalle (1979) who points out, with reserve, a
female captured in Bihain in 1978. The presence of /. herrichii in the country is therefore
confirmed here on the basis of a male specimen which presents all the characteristics
of this species (in particular the side with very dense white hairiness and the veins of the
white-spotted homeolytra). It's a willow-leaved leafhopper
(especially Salix alba, Salix fragilis and their hybrids), which overwinters in the
of imago. Lindbergina aurovittata (Douglas fir)

Material: 1 3, 24.ix.2003. This Holo-Mediterranean element was reported for the first time in Belgium,
Vrasene (in East Flanders) by Van Stalle (1979) who nevertheless has reservations
on its identification based on a single female specimen. The aedeagus of
the specimen from Gembloux is identical to that of L. pandellei Lethierry sensu Ribaut
(1936: fig. 283), a taxon now considered synonymous with L. aurovittata (cf. notably Giustina, 1989). The leafhopper is bivoltine and occurs on different
leafy trees and shrubs (Rubus, Quercus, Carpinus, Fagus, etc.). She winters at
the embryonic state (Nickel & Remane, 2002). Gembloux Faunal Notes, No. 52 (2003) 13

Linnavuoriana decempunctata (Fallén)

Material: 1 3, 15.viii.2003. Widely distributed Eurosiberian species, but generally considered rare
in western Europe. It is thus only known from two French localities
(Giustina, 1989) and is considered vulnerable in Germany (Nickel &
Remane, 2002). In Belgium, the only reported capture comes from the region
Liège region, more precisely Sart-Tilman (Synave & Van Stalle, 1980). She lives on
Betula spp. and is univoltine. Hibernation takes place in the adult stage. Placotettix taeniatifrons (Kirschbaum) [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 1 3, 5.viii.1999. European species with patchy distribution, lacking in particular in Germany
(Nickel & Remane, 2002), in Denmark and Fenno-Scandinavia (Ossiannilsson,
1983), but existing on the other hand in the British Isles and in the Netherlands (Le
Quesne & Payne, 1981; Gravestein, 1976). In France, this leafhopper seems
widespread almost everywhere except for the northern portion and the regions
mountains (Giustina, 1989). The species lives on Quercus spp. (Ribaut, 1952) and
other leafy trees and shrubs. It is also reported in several
regions on cultivated rhododendrons. Ribautiana debilis Douglas [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 1 3, 15.viii.2003. European species reported to date in France, Switzerland, Netherlands, Czechia,
Italy, the British Islands (Nast, 1987) and recently also in Germany or its
presence was first mentioned 4 Cologne by Frommer (1996). He
seems surprising to us to find this leafhopper so late in our country then
that in her time, Ribaut (1936) already indicated that she lives all over France. We there
We also know about ten other Belgian localities. It is a species
bivoltine, overwintering in the egg state, which seems to be essentially linked to rosaceae
shrubs (Rubus, Malus, Pyrus, Prunus, ...). Zyginella pulchra Loew [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 1310 9, 15.viii.2003. This Mediterranean leafhopper, not yet mentioned from Belgium, was
observed on various occasions in the Gembloutoise region but also in at least
6 other dispersed localities (obs. pers.). It currently reaches in our country
as well as in Germany (Frommer, 1996, e.a.) the northern limit of its range. The species, monovoltine and arboreal, lives more particularly on Acer spp. She
overwinters as an adult. The pigmentation of the homeolyters of males is quite
variable. The form mariannae, described from France by Giustina (1989), is found
also in Belgium. Alloeotomus germanicus Wagner

Material: 1 3, 5.viii.1999. Species widely distributed in continental Europe and Turkey (cf. Kerzhner &
Josifov, 1999), which seems however uncommon and very localized in Belgium or the
number of known localities is less than 4 10 (Viskens, 2002). It's a bug
entomophagous living on Pinus spp. and wintering in the embryonic state. The images
appear in summer (Wagner & Weber, 1964). Europiella decolor (Uhler) (= Plagiognathus abrotani Wagner) [Belg. not. sp.] Material: 19, 27.vi.2001; 1 41 9, 4.viii.2003. Belonging to a group of Miridae (the subgenus Poliopterus sensu Wagner &
Weber, 1964) whose taxonomy is complex and the distinction of the different

14 J.Y. Baugnee

often delicate representatives (Schuh ef a/., 1995), our specimens were subjected to a
F. Chérot who confirmed their specific identity. Although not previously noted
(cf. Aukema et al., 2002), its occurrence in Belgium was expected since
reported from many European countries including the Netherlands, G.-D. from Luxemburg,
etc (cf. Kerzhner & Josifov, 1999). This bug lives on Artemisia maritima and
Artemisia abrotanum, non-indigenous plants in Wallonia. According to Wagner & Weber
(1964), imagos are present in September and October and there are probably
two annual generations. In Gembloux, the adult bugs were found
only from June to August! Acompocoris alpinus Reuter

Material: 4 3 2 ©, 5.viii.1999. As in the case of A. germanicus, this species has a wide distribution area,
while appearing rare in our country. Its presence was only noted in four
localities so far: Boitsfort in 1923, Mont-Rigi in 1977, Antheit in 1989 and
Arlon/Landbruch in 1998 (Bosmans & Peéricart, 1989; Baugnée, 1999; Dethier and
al., 2003). However, we have found it in recent years in a
fifteen other stations that have remained unpublished, indicating that the bug is
probably more common than you think. It lives on Pinus sylvestris or it
hunts aphids (Péricart, 1972). Anthocoris butleri Le Quesne

Material: 2 31 ©, 5.viii.1999; 1 3, 9.viii.2003. This European species, very close to A. nemoralis, was only mentioned once
only once in Belgium, at ‘s Gravenvoeren, in the Fourons (Bosmans & Péricart,
1989). Very recently, Dethier et a/. (2003) mentioned it with reservations by d'Antheit-
Corphalia, ot its presence is, however, little doubtful. We have also noted it as
several times in the Meuse valley (Yvoir, Dinant) and in Calestienne
(Dourbes, Roly, Dion). It is a bug strictly subservient to Buxus
sempervirens or it hunts Psylla buxi and perhaps other small insects. She
usually produces two generations per year and overwinters in the imago state
(Pericart, 1972). Liorhyssus hyalinus (Fabricius)

Material: 1 9, 15.viii.2003. This cosmopolitan Rhopalidae has, in Europe, a distribution mainly
Mediterranean. In Belgium, it is known from 6 scattered localities, including
Gembloux where a capture had already been made in 1999 on the site of the former
sugar factory (Baugnée ef a/., 2001). The species growing on all kinds of
ruderal plants (more particularly Compositae), seems to be expanding and
could well have been favored by the periods of heat that we experienced these
last years. Rhaphigaster nebulosa (Poda)

Material: 1 ex., 15.ix.2003 (not rec.). Considered as the largest Pentatomidae in our regions (14-16 mm), this
Holo-Mediterranean species appears very localized although the number
observations has been increasing significantly over the past decade (Dethier &
Gallant, 1998). We thus note its presence even in the region of Antwerpen
(comm. pers. G. Viskens) when it was once confined to the south of the country
(Bosmans, 1975). It lives on various trees and shrubs (Acer spp., Pinus sylvestris,
etc.). Gembloux Faunal Notes, No. 52 (2003) 15

Conclusion

The inventory that we have just presented brings together a total of 156 species
of Hemiptera, i.e. 11 psyllids, 62 Auchenorhynchae and 83 bugs, which is
considerable for a (peri-)urban site. However, there is no point of
comparison with other situations, given that no study has been
devoted, to our knowledge, to the hemipterological fauna of parks and gardens
from Belgium. With regard to the Auchenorhynchae, the number of new species for the
country (9) is remarkably high, but above all this indicates the degree of
ignorance of this group. On the other hand, it is certain that new
research would make it possible to significantly lengthen the list. As an indication, Frommer
(1996) listed, in a botanical garden located in Cologne, no less than 75
Auchenorhynchus species! The diversity of Heteroptera is also to be underlined. At this stage of
inventory, it is comparable to certain stations reputed to be biologically very
rich, such as the site of Corphalie or Dethier et a/. (2003) identified 78 species
(essentially through the use of traps). The sustainability of this biodiversity, the study of which has only just begun, will only be guaranteed
only through careful management of the site with the maintenance of refuge areas, the
conservation of native plant species, respect for old trees, the
limitation of the use of phytosanitary products, etc. The establishment of a
“ecoscope” (Anonymous, 1997) indicates that the authorities of the Faculty seem well
aware of the interest and fragility of this natural heritage. Summary

A preliminary list of Hemiptera (Heteroptera, Auchenorrhyncha and Psylloidea)
observed in 1999 to 2003 in the park of the “Faculté universitaire des Sciences
agronomic” at Gembloux (Belgium, province of Namur) is provided. A total of 11
species of Psylloidea, 62 Auchenorrhyncha and 83 Heteroptera has been observed. 10
species are recorded as new from the Belgian fauna: the psyllid Cacopsylla
brunneipennis (Edwards); the leafhoppers Alebra coryli Le Quesne, Edwardsiana
plurispinosa (Wagner), Empoasca affinis Nast, Eupteryx artemisiae (Kirschbaum),
Eupteryx florida Ribaut, Placotettix taeniatifrons (Kirschbaum), Ribautiana debilis
Douglas and Zyginella pulchra Loew and the plant bug Europiella decolor (Uhler). The occurrence in Belgium of the leafhoppers Eupteryx zelleri (Kirschbaum),
Idiocerus herrichii (Kirschbaum) and Lindbergina aurovittata (Douglas), is confirmed. Key words: Hemiptera, bugs, leafhoppers, jumping plant-lice, botanical garden,
faunistics, Belgium. Thanks

We would like to especially thank Dr. Daniel Burckhardt (CH-Basel) for the
determination of certain Psylloidea, Mr. Armand Matocq (F-Paris) for that of
Trigonotylus coelestialium, and Dr. Frédéric Chérot (ULB) for his review of one of
our specimens of Europiella decolor and his constructive criticisms of the manuscript. 16 J.Y. Baugnee
