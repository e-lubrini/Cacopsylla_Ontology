SUMMARY

European Stone Fruit Yellows (ESFY) phytoplasma disease on apricot was identified by molecular methods for the first time in 1992 in
Hungary. Currently, the pathogen is known as ‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum ’. Since, the pathogen become wide-spreaded and many of the
apricot-plantations had to be eliminated. In 2009 and 2010 in the countryside of Boldogkévéralja the infection of the apricot-plantations was
about 77%. As the disease spreading and causing large damages, we studied the role of possible vector, the plum psyllid (Cacopsylla pruni
Scopoli) in the areas of Boldogkévaralja, North-East-Hungary. Studies were done in the year of 2016, monitoring the behavior of the
psyllids in four different areas, and caught 41 them for further examination, We collected plant samples from those apricot trees, on which the
