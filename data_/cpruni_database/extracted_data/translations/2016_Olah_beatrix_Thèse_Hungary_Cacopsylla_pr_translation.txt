2.1 Characteristics of phytoplasmas

The phytoplasms of the cell wall are inaccessible to bacteria that report quantitative and
they can cause health damage in many cultivated cultures, including the genus. According to their current taxonomic classification, they belong to the class Mollicutes. Their dimensions are 500 nm

kGriili, their genomes vary between 500 and 1000 kb (BAI ET AL, 2006). They are found in a single cell gut bounded by a three-layer cytoplasmic membrane. Phytoplasmas a

due to their teens, the cochlea was previously thought to be a virus. 2.1.1 Systematic classification of phytoplasmas

The taxonomic placement of phytoplasmas is not yet fully elucidated. Until the 1960s
the applicant was kept as a virus (SAMUEL ET AL. 1933, SZIRMAI 1956), this a
classification was based on the fact that at the time of their occurrence they were similar to
on anofas infected with viruses. In 1967, Doi and colleagues believed he was infected with the virus
unicellular unicellular unicellular cells have been found in the phloem of anthems (DOI ET AL., 1967). Immune and genetic tests have been established (LEE ET AL., 1993, SEEMULLER
ET AL., 1994) that the cormorants belong to the class Mollicutes, the most close relatives of which are
Acheloplasmas, therefore phytoplasma (‘Candidatus phytoplasma’) was proposed in 1994.
(SEARS ET AL., 1994). 16S rDNA is the method currently used for the detection and identification of phytoplasmas

amplifiers (LEE ET AL., 1992; AHRENS & SEEMULLER, 1992). Based on the analysis of the sequences, 14 groups (16S groups) and 32 subgroups were eluted,
which can be found in Annex 1. From the 16S group, the witch sweeping of the 16SrX apple tree
I illustrate the most significant members of the group (Table 1). Table 1. The most significant members of the 16 SrX Apple Tree Witch Sweeping Group. As a consequence of the related kinship relationship, the DNA of the three phytoplasmic groups

selection of propagating material during installation. Another defensive solution is the restriction of vectors. Resistance breeding would be an option in the future, but it still has many difficulties
(AUDERGON, 1997, SULE 2014). The vector is the plum leaf flea (CARRARO ET AL., 2001d, FIALOVA ET AL.,
2007, TEDESCHI ET AL., 2006, TORRES ET AL., 2004). 12

In order to develop effective control, we need to be familiar with the spread of leaf fleas
determinants and population dynamics (number of individuals, direction of vandallas,
major populacids and developmental time points) (BOZSIK, 2014a). These have already been clearly defined in most European countries (CARRARO ET AL.,
2001e, TEDESCHI ET AL., 2006, FIALOVA ET AL., 2007, MARCONE ET AL., 2010b). In Hungary, no one has yet handled accurate data. The defense should start in the early spring against the imagdk and then the ovaries

4.6 Sequencing of purified samples

For further analysis, 3 samples were selected that are fO1 / rOl 16SrX group-specific.
were amplified with primers. PCR products were excised from gel gels, purified and

sequenced. Of the 16SrX group, only ‘Ca. The entire genome of Phytoplasma mali ’is known and is therefore sought after

in this sequence, the gene region flanked by the primers f01 / rO1. This ‘Ca. Phytoplasma mali ’specific 16S rRNA gene region was compared 6 times in the NCBI
Using the BLAST program, you can find sequences in the NCBI database. The
Comparison showed that this DNA segment was best treated with ‘Ca Phytoplasma prunorum’.

‘Ca. Phytoplasma pyri ’and‘ Ca. Phytoplasma mali ’16SrRNA sequences. With the help of the Clustal Omega adapter program, you can assume that certain
sequences, how similar they are, how different they are from each other and from the base bar

break it down to see where the difference in sequences is. Thus, the sequences extracted using the BLAST program were copied into the Clustal Omega

to the program that created the joints. The parts marked with an asterisk are a complete match

33

represent between sequences where there is no asterisk where there is a base pair difference of one or more

also in sequence. For sequence matching, not only the deleted pieces from the database
We used it, but from our samples from the orchard (T1, T5, T9).
PCR products prepared with amplified f {O1 and rO1 primers. The sequencing

it is reasonably clear that ‘Ca Phytoplasma prunorum’ is present in our sample because

an integrated anonymisation technology should be developed. It would be further recommended

to assess possible sources of infection in the environments of plantations. Both the literature and our own results show that the 16SrX phytoplasmic group

that the samples containing the phytoplasma examined by us belong to this group

infected. In summary, the spread of phytoplasmas in Hungary should not be overlooked. To this end, it would be advisable to effectively regulate the arrival and presence of the country
