1 | INTRODUCTION

‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum'’ (‘Ca Phytoplasma prunorum) is a
widespread pathogen of Prunus spp. in Europe and the Mediterranean
region (IPWG, 2018; Steffek, Follak, Sauvion, Labonne, & MacLeod,

 

Abstract

The epidemiology of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ was studied in Austria and
Hungary from 2014 to 2018. Testing of root samples showed average infections rates of
61 and 40% of the Austrian Prunus spinosa and Prunus domestica spp. insititia samples,
respectively. In Hungary, on average 21% of the P. spinosa and 13% of the feral Prunus
cerasifera samples were infected. The pathogen was found in 18 out of 19 apricot
orchards and PCR positive Cacopsylla pruni were observed at 11 out of 17 sampling loca-
tions in both countries. In cage experiments with C. pruni remigrants successful pathogen
transmission to Prunus armeniaca, P. domestica and P. spinosa seedlings in budding and
foliated developmental stages was recorded, an inoculation access period of 4 hr was
sufficient for transmission. A field experiment with ungrafted apricot seedlings planted
in 2012 and 2014 indicated a prominent role of the insect vectors for disease spread. In
2017, 40 and 28% of the trees planted in 2012 and 2014, respectively, were infected. Molecular characterisation based on the genes aceF and imp allowed the discrimination

between 10 phytoplasma types in apricots. Around 70% of the phytoplasma types in

 

apricots were also common in P. spinosa, in P. domestica spp. insititia and in remigrant
C.pruni pointing to a possible pathogen exchange by insects between wild and cultivated
Prunus spp. For disease control, vector management over the entire flight period of the
remigrants seems necessary; when selecting active compounds, the short inoculation

access period of not more than 4 hr should be considered. KEYWORDS

RIEDLE-BAUER er at. Disease symptoms can vary greatly among plant species, rootstocks,
climatic conditions, involved phytoplasma types or tree age, but gen-
erally infected plants share common symptoms in form of premature
bud break, leaf yellowing and reddening in summer and eventually
death of trees (Marcone et al., 2010). In apricots, the pathogen causes
chlorotic, conically rolled leaves, sparse foliation, small, tasteless fruits
as well as dieback and decline of trees (Lederer & Seemiiller, 1992). Early bud break is typical for infected apricot trees in Mediterranean
areas (Marcone et al., 2010; Morvan, 1977) but seems less common in
Hungary (Siile, 1999). Based on sequence analysis of 16S rDNA, ‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum’ is classified into the Apple proliferation group
(16SrX), together with other important fruit tree phytoplasmas such
as ‘Ca. Phytoplasma mali’ and ‘Ca. Phytoplasma pyri’ (Seemiiller &
Schneider, 2004). The only known insect vector transmitting the pathogen is the plum
psyllid Cacopsylla pruni (Scopoli, 1763) (Carraro, Osler, Loi, Ermacora, &
Refatti, 1998). Molecular analyses suggest that C. pruni actually is a com-
plex of two cryptic species that are not yet distinguished morphologically
and have a similar biology (Peccoud, Labonne, & Sauvion, 2013; Peccoud,
Pleydell, & Sauvion, 2018; Sauvion, Lachenaud, Genson, Rasplus, & Lab-
onne, 2007). The plum psyllid is a univoltine species that completes its
immature to adult life cycle on Prunus spp. In spring, the insects mate and
lay eggs on wild and cultivated Prunus species. In late spring or at the
beginning of summer, the new generation of C. pruni adults leaves the
Prunus hosts and migrates to conifers in mountainous regions (emi-
grants). In the following year, at the end of winter or at the beginning of
spring, the insects migrate back to Prunus spp. plants (remigrants), repro-
duce and die (Ossiannilsson, 1992; Thébaud, Yvon, Alary, Sauvion, &
Labonne, 2009). These results on C. pruni life cycle were confirmed by
observations in a permanent rearing of the species under experimental
conditions (W. Jarausch & Jarausch, 2016). Recent investigations on the
factors responsible for the regulation of migration revealed that migrat-
ing psyllids do feed on overwintering hosts but the nymphs are unable to
develop on conifer diet (Gallinger & Gross, 2018). C. pruni transmits ‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum’ in a persistent
propagative manner as the pathogen was shown to multiply in both
immature and mature insects (Thébaud et al., 2009). Several studies
suggest that in the field the remigrants are the crucial life stage for
phytoplasma transmission (Carraro, Ferrini, Labonne, Ermacora, & Loi,
2004; Thébaud et al., 2009). For successful phytoplasma transmission,
an acquisition access period of 2-4 days, minimum latent periods of
2-3 weeks and inoculation access periods (IAP) of 1-2 days were
reported (Carraro, Loi, & Ermacora, 2001; Thébaud et al., 2009). Basic strategies for ESFY management include the use of healthy
propagating material and the uprooting of infected trees in orchards. In
some regions, however, the success of these measures is compromised
as wild Prunus species hosting both the vectoring insects and the phy-
toplasma might play a significant role as phytoplasma sources (Carraro,
Ferrini, Ermacora, & Loi, 2002; Maier et al, 2013; Marcone et al.,
2010). In a recent study in the Baix Llobregat area of Spain, feral Prunus
mahaleb plants were suspected as the infection source for the nearby
P. salicina orchards (Sabaté, Lavina, & Battle, 2016). Investigations in

Germany estimated wild Prunus spinosa as a major source of infection
in stone fruit orchards (W. Jarausch et al., 2019). A multilocus sequence analysis approach based on the genes aceF,
pnp, secY and imp allowing the analysis of genetic diversity of ‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum’ has been developed by Danet et al. (2011). Among the four genetic loci used in this and a recent Slovenian
(Dermastia, Dolanc, Mlinar, & Mehle, 2018) study, the genes imp
(34 characterised haplotypes) encoding for an immunodominant sur-
face protein and aceF (26 haplotypes) encoding for dihydrolipoamide
acyltransferase, a protein involved in glycolysis, showed the highest
variability and discriminative power. In Austria, apricots are currently produced on an area of approxi-
mately 1,000 ha, of which more than 65% are located in the Federal
Province of Lower Austria, approximately 16% in Styria and around 10%
in Burgenland (Statistik Austria, 2018). In the past two decades, ESFY
has become a major concern in all these areas, around the year 2000
infection rates of up to 40% were reported in apricot orchards (Laimer
Da Camara Machado et al., 2001; Richter, 1999, 2002). The highly sus-
ceptible "Klosterneuburger Marille” (variety group "Hungarian Best’) is
the most important apricot variety in Austria (30%), followed by
“Orangered” (13%), Goldrich (10%), Bergeron (8%), “Pinkcot” and "Sil-
vercot” (both 5%) (Statistik Austria, 2018). In intensive orchards, plants
are predominantly grafted on plum rootstocks (mostly “TORINEL®
avifel,” "St. Julien A.” "WAVIT® Prudom’), in extensive production plum
seedlings “Brompton” and apricot seedlings are also used (Wurm, 2018). Often apricot orchards are small scale structured without any vector
management. Many production areas are located in close vicinity to
mountainous regions with high densities of conifers presumably serving
as overwintering hosts for the vectors. From 2011 to 2013, PCR analyses
in the Wachau region of Lower Austria based on leaf testing showed a
disease incidence of 9.8 to 63.3% in apricot orchards, 20-40% in plum
orchards and occasional infections of P. spinosa (Maier et al., 2013). High
numbers of C. pruni (up to 25 individuals) were observed on blackthorns
ona single branch with one sampling effort (beating tray method). Phyto-
plasma infection rates ranged between 11.5% for the remigrants and
3.4% for the emigrant insect generation (Maier et al, 2013). In Hungary, apricot is produced on about 5,400 ha (KSH, 2018). Commercial apricot production covers about 4,100 ha. The largest
growing district (34% of the total apricot area) is located mainly in the
northeastern hills, while another 35% are situated on the slopes of
several counties in the western part (Transdanubia), where wild Prunus
species, such as P. spinosa and P. cerasifera are common. Apricot is
grown on sandy soils of the Great Plain (18%) where also wild Prunus
species can be frequently found. Nowadays, the majority of varieties
belong to the variety group of “Magyar kajszi" ("Hungarian Best”);
however, the share of foreign varieties is continuously increasing in
newly established plantations. Most often the trees are grafted on
P. cerasifera seedlings (about 80%), for sandy soil preferably
P. armeniaca is used (about 20%). In the last years, a new highly
grafted interstem system approach gained importance. In this system,
the apricot variety is grafted on Prunus domestica “Fehér besztercei”
(interstem) grafted on P. cerasifera seedlings. A study on the occur-
rence of ESFY in 2009 revealed a widespread and frequent presence

of the disease in several areas of the country. Based on visual symp-
toms, disease incidences of up to 85% were reported for apricot
orchards (Tarczali, Kévics, & Kiss, 2014). Recent surveys on the pres-
ence and the infection status of C. pruni at several locations in Hun-

 

gary showed a wide distribution of the insect species and average
rates of PCR-positive specimens of 15% (Mergenthaler, Kiss, &
Viczian, 2017), 7% (Czibulys, Konez, & Pénzes, 2018) and 35%
(Lepres, Mergenthaler, Viczién, & Téth, 2018). Extensive knowledge on the presence of the pathogen in
orchards, on the relevance of vector-mediated pathogen spread as
compared to transfer via propagation material, on the role of wild Pru-
nus spp. as pathogen sources, on the exchange of phytoplasmas
between the compartments of the epidemic cycle as well as on the
exact times of the year at which the insects transmit the pathogen is a
requirement for well-adapted management strategies. Knowledge on
the length of the IAP is crucial for the selection of insecticides
intended to reduce pathogen spread. In general, a control of pathogen
vectors by insecticides aims to keep vector populations low and thus
to minimise phytoplasma spread. However, in the case of pathogen
vectors moving into a crop from outside, additionally a direct effect of
the insecticide on pathogen transmission is essential. The treatment
should ideally disrupt pathogen inoculation either by a rapid knock-
down effect or by altering the phloem feeding activities to minimise
transmissions (Paleski¢ et al., 2017). As a basis for the development of suitable control strategies, our
study focused on the following aspects of epidemiology and charac-
teristics of vector transmission:

 

Infection rates of wild or feral (initially introduced as cultivated
plants but now naturally spreading) Prunus species and apricot trees in
orchards in Austria and Hungary were determined. Obtained phyto-
plasma types were characterised by aid of aceF and imp gene
sequencing. Phytoplasma types in wild Prunus spp., C. pruni and culti-
vated apricots were analysed to describe the phytoplasma genotypes
in the vector and the wild and cultivated host plant species. A further
objective was to trace the vector-mediated pathogen spread under
field conditions in order to assess the need of insect control measures. ’

Applied Biology

For this purpose, plantations consisting of ungrafted apricot seedlings
were established and monitored for several years. The efficiency
of phytoplasma transmission to different plant hosts at different
developmental stages of trees and insect vectors and the duration of
IAP were studied by aid of transmission experiments under semi field
conditions. 2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1 | Sampling of plants and insects in Hungary and
Austria

Sampling was restricted to apricot producing regions and apricot
orchards in both countries over a wide area, as illustrated in Figure 1
and Supplemental Table $1. Samples of apricots (P. armeniaca), Ger-
man plum (P. domestica ssp. insititia (L.) Bonnier & Layens), myrobalan
plum (P. cerasifera Ehrh,) and blackthorn (P. spinosa L.) were collected
in July-September 2015-2018. All sampled German plums,
myrobalan plums and blackthorns were free of disease symptoms. For
analysis of these plant species, roots located 10-30 cm below the sur-
face were dug out by aid of a shovel. Each sample consisted of at least
two root pieces (diameter 2-10 mm) collected from different sides of
the tree (each tree sampled individually). At sites A2, A3, A5, and A6
in addition to root samples leaf samples of P. spinosa and P. domestica

 

spp. insititia from identical plants were collected for comparison pur-
poses (5-10 leaves from different branches). In contrast to the wild and feral Prunus species at the time of sam-
pling, the P. armeniaca trees showed disease symptoms such as rolling
and/or yellowing of the leaves and sparse foliation. At sampling sites
A10-A13 as well as at sites H1, H2 and H4-H11. sampling in apricot
orchards was based on these symptoms. Suspicious and symptomless
trees were included in the study (Tables 1 and 2, Table $1). In contrast
to that, samples were randomly collected in the orchards at sites A2,
A3 and A7-A9. The small orchard at site A2 was entirely inspected
and included in the random sampling; in case of all other (bigger)
orchards, a sector was randomly selected for inspection and within
that sector random sampling was carried out (Table 1 and Table $1). H3

All apricot samples consisted of 5-10 leaves collected from all sides
of single trees. C. pruni were sampled from March to April in the years
2014-2017 on P. spinosa, P. domestica, and P. cerasifera by the beating
tray method (Table 3). 2.2 | Transmission trials

All insects used for the transmission trials were field-collected from
2012 to 2014 and in 2016. Seed transmission of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ has
never been reported, therefore Prunus spp. seedlings were used as
host plants. One part of test plants (apricot, plum and blackthorn
seedlings for experiments simulating field conditions after blooming
and transmission by emigrant generation insects) was raised from
seeds in our lab. Apricot seeds were harvested in an apricot orchard
(variety “Klosterneuburger Marille’), P. domestica seeds were
harvested from a plum orchard and P. spinosa seeds were collected in
the hedgerows at site A4, The seeds were at first kept at 4°C in moist
sand for 2-3 months and then cultivated in a growth chamber at
21-23°C for approximately 3 months until they had 8-10 fully
expanded leaves. Because these seedlings were produced under

controlled conditions, we were able to rule out any phytoplasma
infections before the start of the experiments. The other part of test
plants consisted of potted 1-year-old certified seedling rootstocks
from a commercial nursery cultivated until BBCH stages 03-09 (end
of bud swelling/development of green tips; BBCH scale according to
Meier et al., 1994). The plants were produced from seeds in a certifi-
cation system which allows to assume with a reasonable degree of
probability that the plants were healthy at the beginning of the experi-
ments. However, infections in the nursery cannot be entirely
excluded. In the transmission experiments on the length of the IAP,
control trees were included. At the end of the experiments, the sur-
viving insects were collected and tested by PCR. Results are given as
average of PCR positive insects per sampling site in Table 4. 2.3 | Experiments simulating field conditions in late
winter and early spring

The objective of the first test series (2012-2014) was to study the
ability of C. pruni to transmit the pathogen to trees at very early devel-
opmental stages at the end of winter or in early spring. Dormant, cer-
tified, 1-year-old apricot seedlings (without closer specification of
cultivar) and “Brompton” plum seedlings (size approximately 50 cm)
were obtained from a commercial nursery and cultivated in pots. The
trials were carried out in March and at the beginning of April under

 

outdoor conditions in a paved courtyard covered with a roof
protecting trials from rain. Ten insects per experiment (remigrants col-
lected by beating tray method on P. spinosa at site Ad) were intro-
duced into cylindrical cages (diameter 3 cm, length 10 cm) attached to
the plants and allowed to feed for 7 days. 2.4 | Experiments simulating field conditions after
bloom

The second group of tests carried out during 2012-2014 aimed to
simulate vector activity after flowering at already warmer outdoor
conditions on foliated trees. Foliated apricot, plum and blackthorn
seedlings raised in our lab were entirely covered with cylindrical cages
(diameter 9 cm, height 25 cm). Per cage, 10 remigrant insects (col-
lected on P. spinosa at site A4 simultaneously with the insects for the
experiments described above) were allowed to feed for 7 days. Before, during and for 2 months after the trials, the test plants were
maintained in a growth chamber at 21-23°C. 2.5 | Transmission by emigrant generation insects

The third group of experiments carried out in June 2012-2014
targeted the question whether the emigrant generation of C. pruni is
capable of transmitting the disease. The test plants and the experi-
mental conditions were the same as for the second group of tests
(experiments simulating field conditions after bloom). Emigrant gener-
ation insects were collected on suckers of the plum rootstocks in the
apricot orchard at site A3 (40 experiments) and on P. spinosa at site
‘Ad (46 experiments). RIEDLE-BAUER Er AL. ‘Annals of

2.6 | Studies on length of IAP

The fourth series of tests carried out in April 2016 aimed to
enlarge our insight into the length of the IAP in practically orien-
tated conditions. In 2012-2014, the highest transmission rates
were recorded in the tests simulating conditions in late winter or
early spring. Therefore, the length of IAP was studied on certified
1-year-old apricot seedlings in BBCH stages 03-09 obtained from
a nursery and maintained outdoors as described for the first test
series. Per cage, 20 remigrant insects were allowed to feed for
4 hr and 3 days. Remigrant insects were collected on suckers of
the plum rootstocks in the apricot orchard at site A3 (nine experi-
ments feeding duration 4 hr, seven experiments feeding duration
3 days) and on P. spinosa at site A4 (22 experiments with feeding
duration 4 hr; five experiments with feeding duration 3 days). Six-
teen seedlings from the same batch of purchased seedlings served
as control plants. After the transmission trials, all plants were kept in pots in a foil
tunnel under an insect proof net at outdoor temperatures. Annually in
August-September, all plants were visually inspected and 2-3 root
pieces (diameter 2-5 mm) per plant were excised taking particular
care to maintain a functioning root system in order to keep the plants
alive for further analyses. 2.7 | Monitoring of infection risk in the field

The objective of this experiment was to trace the vector-mediated
pathogen spread and the development of ESFY under field conditions. The experiment was carried out in Krems (Lower Austria). At this loca-
tion, an examination of the remigrant vector population in 2012 by
direct PCR had demonstrated an infection rate of 8.6% (Maier et al. 2013). Dormant certified 1-year-old apricot seedling rootstocks (iden-
tical to plants described above for transmission experiments) were
obtained from a commercial nursery and left ungrafted during the
entire experiment. Plantings were carried out both in spring 2012
(March 28) and in spring 2014 (March 10) as illustrated in Figure 2. In
the 2014 planting two times, five apricot seedlings were protected
from C. pruni by an insect proof net. The nets entirely covered single
plants and were installed every year from the beginning of March until
July. Samples of each individual plant were taken annually in August
or September. In 2013-2016 leaves (5-10 leaves randomly collected
from all sides of the tree) and in 2017 roots (2-3 root pieces diameter
2-10 mm) were collected. Visual inspection of the trees based on
yellowing and rolling of the leaves and sparse foliation was carried out
in summer. Trees were classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic. Because of significant signs of drought stress, no visual inspection
was carried out in 2017, but only in 2018. Dead trees were also
recorded. In the area, early bud break seems less common than in
other regions (Stile, 1999), thus an explicit assessment of early bud
break was not included in the study. In any case, no observation in

this regard was made while maintaining the test orchards. al WILE Y— Arnica tiotogy RIEDLE-BAUER er at. Outline of test orchards N mm FIGURE 2 Map of the

2.8 | PCR analysis

DNA extraction from plant and insect samples was carried out by a
CTAB procedure as described previously (Maixner, Ahrens, &
Seemilller, 1995). Each plant or insect was analysed individually. In
case of leaf samples, midrib and petiole tissue of five leaves per sam-
ple was combined. Roots were exhaustively washed by aid of a rough
sponge. Each sample consisted of two cross sections per root piece. The presence of phytoplasmas was detected by direct PCR,
nested PCR and/or qualitative real real-time PCR. For the direct PCR
procedure, we used the primer pair f01/r01 (Lorenz, Schneider, Ahrens, &
Seemiller, 1995). All samples yielding the expected PCR fragment were
characterised by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using
Rsal to differentiate ‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum’ from other 16SrX
phytoplasmas and to exclude unspecific PCR products (Seemiiller &
Schneider, 2004). For nested PCR, primers P1/P7 (Deng & Hiruki, 1991;
Smart et al., 1996) and R16(X) F1/ R16(X)R1 (Lee, Bertaccini, Vibio, &

Tree positive in nested PCR (16S rRNA), undetermined type of ,Ca.P. prunorum’

Gundersen, 1995) were used. R16(X) fragments were further
characterised by RFLP as described above. The assignation of C. pruni
to genetic groups A or B was performed with PCR of the ITS2 region
using primer sets ITS set 1 and ITS set 3 as described (Peccoud et al.,
2013). For qualitative real-time PCR, we followed the procedure of
Christensen, Nicolaisen, Hansen, & Schulz (2004) using SensiFAST
Probe No.Rox Kit (Bioline, London, UK) according to the manufacturer's
instructions and an MIC thermocycler (Biomolecular Systems, Upper
Coomera, Australia). One microliter of template preparation was
included in 20 pl reaction volumes. Samples yielding Ct levels <30 were
considered as phytoplasma-infected. The three PCR methods have different characteristics. The nested
PCR protocol presumably is the most sensitive, but in general nested
protocols suffer from the risk of contamination and thus false positive
results. The direct PCR protocol is less sensitive, and the qPCR proto-
col is not specific for ‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum’ but a universal phy-

toplasma test. We have tested different types of samples with all

protocols as listed in Table S2a and tested for significant differences
as described in Table $2b. Overall, data presented for C. pruni samples
were obtained by direct PCR (Austrian samples) or qPCR (Hungarian
samples). The phytoplasma species in positive qPCR samples was con-
firmed by the nested PCR protocol. All data for plant samples were
derived from nested PCR. 2.9 | Characterisation of phytoplasma strains

Infected plant and insect samples from Austria were further
characterised by aid of the genes aceF and imp. The analysis com-
prised plant and insect samples from the locations shown in Figure 1
and Table $1 and in addition P. armeniaca samples identified as
infected in previous investigations in Lower Austria (Maier et al.,
2013), namely from Rohrendorf (43 samples), Krustetten (four sam-
ples), Krems (two samples) and Rossatz (three samples). All in all,
211 samples were analysed. Fragments of the genes aceF and imp
were amplified in nested PCR procedures using the primers AceFf1/
AceFri, AceFf2/AceFr2 and IMPF1/IMPR1, IMPF2/IMPR2 (Danet
et al., 2011) and sequenced (Sanger method performed by GATC Bio-
tech, now Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) with the primers
AceFr2 and IMPR2 after purification by the Qiaquick® PCR purifica-
tion kit (Mo Bio, Qiagen). 3 | RESULTS

3.1. | Suitability of PCR methods

As illustrated in Table S2a, in case of P. armeniaca (leaves and roots)
and P. cerasifera root samples, all three PCR methods led to largely
comparable results. In contrast, in case of P. spinosa and P. domestica

 

nested PCR gave higher numbers of positive PCR reactions than the
other two methods. Statistical analysis confirms a significant higher
number of positive nested PCR results compared to single PCR in
P. spinosa and P. domestica ssp. insititia (Table S2c,d). 3.2 | Analysis of plants and insects in Hungary and
Austria

PCR analyses of apricot and P. cerasifera rootstocks samples from
both countries demonstrated the presence of the pathogen in all
orchards except site H7 (Tables 1 and 2). A random sampling effort in
the apricot orchards at sites A2, A3 and A7-A9 revealed infection
rates between 30 and 70%. In both countries, the phytoplasma was found in roots of wild or
feral Prunus spp. In Austria, the infection rates of P. spinosa reached
up to 70% and in Hungary up to 50%. In Austria, the infection rates of
P. domestica spp. insititia were as high as 62.5% (Table 1), in Hungary
up to 25% of the feral P. cerasifera samples also showed a positive
PCR reaction (Table 2). In case of P. spinosa and P. domestica spp. insititia, comparative
analyses of root and leaf material taken from identical plants at identi-
cal time points were carried out. In P. spinosa, the phytoplasma was

detected in roots only, in case of P. domestica spp. insititia, roots sam-
ples resulted in higher rates of PCR positive plants (Table 1). Statistical
analysis confirmed the significant effect of the plant material on the
PCR result for both plant species (Table $2d,e). Phytoplasma infections of C. pruni were detected at 9 out of
12 locations in Austria and 2 out of 5 locations in Hungary. Infection
rates amounted up to 10.9% in Austria (average of 12 sites 6.1%) and
14.2% in Hungary (average over five sites 2.9%) (Table 3). All phyto-
plasma positive C. pruni and at least five individuals from each origin
(except H4 with only one collected individual) were tested by PCR
with ITS set 1 and ITS set 3 primers. All individuals belonged to
genetic group B of the C. pruni complex. 3.3 | Transmission trials

3.3.1 | Experiments simulating field conditions in
late winter and early spring

In transmission trials with 1-year-old seedlings obtained from a com-
mercial nursery at BBCH stages 03-09 and 10 C. pruni remigrants per
cage feeding for 7 days, the pathogen was transmitted to 15.7% of
the P. armeniaca and to 7.7% of the P. domestica plants (Table 4), PCR
testing of the insects showed an infection rate of 14.3% for the
remigrants collected at site A4 on P. spinosa. The median value for the

number of insects surviving the test duration of 7 days was six. 3.3.2 | Experiments simulating field conditions after
bloom

The experiments with foliated test plants raised from seeds in our lab
and 10 remigrant C. pruni per plant feeding for 7 days led to 5.3% of
PCR-positive P. armeniaca seedlings and 33.3% of PCR-positive
P. spinosa seedlings, plum seedlings were not infected (Table 4). Insects
in this study were from the same collections as for simulating field condi-
tions in late winter and early spring, thus infection rates of insects were
identical to the ones stated above (14.3%). A median value of six insects

per experiments survived the test duration of 7 days. 3.3.3 | Transmission by emigrant generation insects

No phytoplasma transmission by new generation psyllids was
observed (Table 4). A 28.3% of the insects originating from plum root-
stock suckers in the apricot orchard at site A3 were PCR positive, but
0% of the individuals captured at site A4 on P. spinosa. A median value
of six individuals per cage survived the test period of 7 days. 3.3.4 | Studies on length of IAP

To evaluate the necessary IAP, 20 C. pruni remigrants were kept on
41-year-old apricots seedlings at BBCH stages 03-09 for 4 hr and 3 days,
respectively. Inoculation access for 4 hr resulted in successful phyto-
plasma transmission to 2 out of 31 test plants (6.5%), inoculation access
for 3 days led to 1 infected test plant out of 12 (8.3%). No infections of

control plants were found (Table 4). Positive transmissions were only
observed with insects captured on P. spinosa (site A4, rate of PCR posi-
tive individuals 5.8%), whereas all experiments including insects collected
on P. domestica rootstock suckers (site A3, rate of PCR positive individ-
uals 3.3%) remained uninfected. A median number of 17 individuals were
still alive after the 4 hr transmission experiments, after the 3 day experi-
ments the median value of living individuals per cage was eight. 3.4 | Monitoring of pathogen spread and ESFY
development in the field

The objective of the experiment was to monitor pathogen spread and
appearance of ESFY symptomatic trees under field conditions. Testing
of leaf samples collected from 2013 to 2016 resulted in no detection
of phytoplasmas in any of the trees (data not shown). In contrast, the
analysis of roots in 2017 demonstrated that 24 out of 60 trees (40%)
planted in 2012 and 14 out of 50 trees (28%) planted in 2014 and
grown in open air were infected by the phytoplasma (Figure 2). As
opposed to that, no phytoplasma was detected in any of the trees
protected by an insect proof net. In 2018, 25.4% of the trees (15 out
of 59) planted in 2012 showed disease symptoms, one had died. Of
the trees planted in 2014 and maintained in open air, 4.5% (two out
of 44) were symptomatic and 13.6% (six) had died. A 54.1% (13 out of
24) of the PCR-positive trees planted in 2012 were without symp-
toms, and out of the trees tested as healthy by PCR, 4 of 36 (11.1%)
had been scored as symptomatic. The trees planted in 2014 showed
an even higher rate of latent infection, 81% of the PCR positive trees
(nine out of 11) appeared healthy. All symptomatic trees planted in
2014 also gave a positive PCR result (Figure 2). 3.5 | Phytoplasma strains

A total of 211 phytoplasma infected samples was characterised by aid
of the genes aceF and imp. Sequence analysis led to the discrimination
of five different aceF and five different imp variants (Figure 3)
resulting in 10 different phytoplasma types ATPRU 1-10 (Figure S1
and Table 5). All of them were present in apricot trees, and ATPRU
1-6 were found in remigrant C. pruni. For some P. domestica spp. insititia and P. spinosa samples as well as for samples from transmis-
sion trials in the field and in the lab, successful amplification of the
imp gene was not obtained, despite positive 16S rRNA and aceF gene
amplifications. In such cases, based on aceF gene only, an unambigu-
ous ascription of the phytoplasma to a type was only partially possi-
ble. Nevertheless the analysis allowed to identify at least five
different types (ATPRU1-ATPRUS) in P. domestica spp. insititia and
four (ATPRU2-ATPRUS) P. ATPRU2-ATPRUS
accounted for almost 70% of the infections of P. armeniaca trees in

spinosa plants. orchards and for 87% of the phytoplasma types in C. pruni remigrants. Less than 5% of the phytoplasmas in commercial apricot orchards
were not detected in any other compartment of the epidemic cycle. ATPRU1 accounts for 20% of the phytoplasma samples in
P. armeniaca, but has been detected only once with Prunus spp.,
namely in P. domestica spp. insititia (Figure $1 and Table 5). At least

four types (ATPRU 2-4, ATPRU 10) were transmitted in the field
experiment aiming to monitor pathogen spread and at least two types
were found in the host plants included in laboratory transmission
experiments (Figure 3 and Figure $1). 11 was the most prevalent imp
haplotype in P. domestica spp. insititia (>40%), P. spinosa (67%) as well
as in C. pruni remigrants (50%), while 15% of the ESFY positive
P. armeniaca contained this genotype. 14 was the most common type
in P. armeniaca (55%) and it was also present in P. domestica spp. insititia (30%), P. spinosa (17%) and C. pruni (42%). 110 was regularly
found in P. armeniaca (23%) but only occasionally in C. pruni (8%), in a
single case in P. domestica spp. insititia and not at all in P. spinosa

common haplotype in P. armeniaca, A6, occurred at 40%. This haplo-
type was also identified in P. domestica spp. insititia (20%), P. spinosa
(7.,7%) and in C. pruni (25%) (Figure 3b). An unambiguous detection of
different strains from single individuals (multiple infections) was not
recorded. 4 | DISCUSSION

The data obtained in the present study provide an insight
into the current dissemination and the epidemiology of ‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum’ in Hungary and in Austria. Strikingly high pro-
portions of wild and feral Prunus species at several locations in both
countries were found to be infected, although none of the tested
plants showed any disease symptom. A fundamental role of wild Pru-
nus spp. for disease epidemiology was already emphasised previously
(Carraro et al., 2002; W. Jarausch et al., 2019; Maier et al., 2013). The
data obtained in the current study support the assumption that beside
infested nursery plants also natural contaminations play a role in ESFY
occurrence in apricot orchards in several respects. First, at some loca-
tions the root testing carried out in this study showed pathogen pres-
ence in up to 70% of the P. spinosa and up to 62.5% of the feral
P. domestica plants. Infection rates comparable to our findings were
also reported from Belarus, where root analysis led to the detection
of phytoplasmas in two out of three P. spinosa samples (Valasevich &
Schneider, 2016). Having regard also to the fact that myrobalans,
blackthorns and plums are among the most preferred hosts for the
vector (B. Jarausch, Fuchs, et al, 2007; B. Jarausch, Miihlenz, et al.,
2007; Labonne & Lichou, 2004; Maier et al., 2013; Mergenthaler
et al., 2017), the role of wild or feral Prunus spp. as sources for infec-
tious psyllids seems crucial. Second, as illustrated in Figure S3 and
Figure 3 and discussed in detail below, the molecular characterisation
of the phytoplasma types in this study showed a high degree of corre-
spondence of pathogen types in wild and cultivated Prunus spp., in
C. pruni as well as in the test plants in the transmission experiments. Although only a descriptive observation, this indicates a possible phy-
toplasma exchange between wild (blackthorn, German plum) and culti-
vated Prunus spp. in a joint epidemic cycle. Third, in our transmission
experiments, the highest rate (33%) of infected plants was observed
for P. spinosa, Apart from the conclusion that blackthorn is a suitable
host both for the insect species and the pathogen, this observation
indicates that pathogen dissemination, maybe also to so far pathogen-
free regions, could also happen independently from cultivated
Prunus spp. Corresponding to the infection rates of their preferred host plants,
a significant share of the remigrant C. pruni at the majority of sampling
sites in both countries was also phytoplasma positive. The average of
all sites in Austria was 6.1%, in Hungary 2.9%, at specific sites up to
11% in Austria and up to 14% in Hungary. In previous investigations
in Italy, remigrant insects in areas with infected orchards were in a
similar range of up to 9% infection (Carraro et al., 2004), whereas, for
example, in Germany recently lower rates have been recorded (1-2%;
W. Jarausch et al., 2019). C. pruni consists of a complex of cryptic

2 | WILEY ieee,

RIEDLE-BAUER er at. species, of which in Europe East of France, Western Switzerland and
Italy, only genotype B has been reported (Peccoud et al., 2013). In
confirmation of this result, all analysed C. pruni collected in Austria
and Hungary were genotype B of the C. pruni complex. In accordance with the high infection rates in vector insects and in
wild host plants, the pathogen was identified in the majority of
analysed apricot orchards in both countries, as reported previously
(Steffek et al, 2012). Random sampling in several Austrian orchards
proved infection rates ranging between at least 30 and 70%, a dimen-
sion capable of seriously compromising apricot cultivation. The infec-
tion rates observed in this study coincide with previous reports on
high infection rates both in Austria and in Hungary (Maier et al., 2013;
Tarczali et al., 2014). In our transmission experiments, C. pruni remigrants transmitted
the pathogen to P. armeniaca, P. domestica and P. spinosa plants. In
case of P. armeniaca, the highest infection rate (15.7%) was observed
for the trees in BBCH stages 03-09 kept under outdoor conditions. Applied to practical field conditions, this indicates that there is a high
infection risk from the start of insect remigration in early spring even
when trees are still dormant or growth has hardly started. The trials limiting the stay of the remigrant insects on trees in
BBCH stages 03-09 to 4 hr only led to successful transmission of the
pathogen in 2 out of 26 experiments. It can therefore be concluded
that the IAP can be much shorter than the previously reported
1-2 days (Carraro et al., 2001). In none of our experiments, the
insects started to feed right after their transfer into the cages. The
insects seemed to be under stress and walked around in the cages for
1-2 hr before they settled. Therefore, IAP under field conditions
could be even shorter than the experimental 4 hr. In our trials, no phytoplasma transmission by field captured spring-
time generation insects was recorded, a finding coinciding with previ-
ous reports indicating no or at the best a very low transmission rate
by adults before overwintering (Carraro et al, 2004; B. Jarausch,
Mithlenz, et al., 2007; Poggi Pollini et al., 2010; Thébaud et al,, 2009). Interestingly, in this experiment, 28.3% of the emigrant insects cap-
tured at site A3 on plum rootstocks suckers of apricot trees, but 0%
of the insects collected at site A4 on P. spinosa gave a positive PCR
result. The transmission rates observed in the current study are lower
than those in previous reports. In experiments in the Friuli Venezia
Giulia region of Italy, groups of 3-20 remigrant insects transmitted
the pathogen to 20-100% of micropropagated P. salicina plants,
groups of 50 individuals infected 80% of P. spinosa and P. cerasifera
seedlings and 100% of apricot seedlings cultivated in the greenhouse
(Carraro et al., 2002, 2004). In Germany, field captured remigrants
transmitted the pathogen to 23% of micropropagated P. marianna
plants (B. Jarausch, Mithlenz, et al,, 2007). The lower transmission
rates in our experiments (15.7% for 1-year-old apricot seedlings in
BBCH stages 03-09, 7.7% for plum seedlings in BBCH stages 03-09
and 5.3 and 33.3% for foliated P. armeniaca and P. spinosa seedlings,
respectively) could be because of differences in the vector capacity of
the insects in different parts of Europe, to varying numbers of insects
in the transmission experiments, to different ages and stages of the

recipient test plants in the experiments or to the cultivation under
outdoor conditions. The marked role of vector transmission for disease spread was
confirmed by the experiments aiming to monitor the infection risk and
the appearance of ESFY symptoms under field conditions. A 40% of
the seedlings planted in 2012 and 28% of the seedlings planted in
2014 were PCR positive after 5 and 3 years, respectively. Around a
quarter of the trees planted in 2012 had developed disease symptoms
after 6 years. Four different phytoplasma types were transmitted. Extrapolated over the lifetime of an apricot orchard, these results
show clearly that in regions with high infection pressure substantially
all trees become infected within their desired life cycle. For this field
study, we considered it as necessary to establish a plantation of
ungrafted 1-year-old apricot seedlings. Generally, fruit trees are gen-
erated using vegetatively propagated planting material (scions and in
most cases also rootstocks) as in commercial orchards uniformity of
planting material and predictability of genetic traits are essential. For
observations on phytoplasma spread via insect vectors, however, such
orchards are less appropriate. The danger of disseminating the phyto-
plasma by vegetative propagating material can be relevant (Marcone
et al, 2010; Riedle-Bauer et al., 2012) and, as shown in previous stud-
ies, PCR does not always give sufficiently clear-cut results to exclude
low infections of young trees. A deeper characterisation of phytoplasmas in plants and insects in
Austria revealed the presence of 10 different types based on aceF and imp
genotypes (Table 5), of which five, namely the types ATPRU1-ATPRUS,
were frequent (Figure 3 and Figure S1). These frequent types consist of
the aceF genotypes (according to Danet et al., 2011) A3, AS, Aé and A8
and the imp genotypes 11, 14 and 110 (Table 5). These more common geno-
types have been also documented in several other Central and South
European countries (Danet et al, 2011; Dermastia et al., 2018) and have
been more frequently found in a recent investigation in Slovenian
orchards (Dermastia et al., 2018). In contrast to that, the rarer aceF and
imp genotypes (A27, 13, 134) have been previously reported at most from
few individuals in single countries or not at all (A27). ATPRU2-ATPRUS
were the four types in wild or feral P. spinosa and P. domestica spp. insititia
and in the field and laboratory assays monitoring vector transmission. Also
in remigrant C. pruni, the types ATPRU2-5 were prevalent. It is therefore
possible that these types spread via an epidemic cycle in which C. pruni
transmits the pathogen from wild Prunus spp. to cultivated P. armeniaca,
and likewise between wild Prunus spp. ATPRU1 with imp genotype 110
was frequent and widespread (at 8 of 12 tested locations all over Eastern
Austria) in P. armeniaca and was sometimes found in remigrant C. pruni. However, we have detected the corresponding imp type (110) only once in
wild Prunus spp. in P. domestica spp. insititia) and never in the transmission
trials. The corresponding aceF type of ATPRU1, B7, has also only rarely
been found in the wild Prunus spp. Although in our experiments we have
not been able to successfully amplify the imp gene of all samples, it
appears that vector transmission of ATPRU1 does less likely occur. There-
fore, the question arises whether some phytoplasma types such as those
containing 110 are prevalently disseminated by propagating material. The
frequent occurrence of ATPRU1 could indicate that in addition to vector

transmission in practice, propagating material is also a relevant source of

the phytoplasma in the Austrian and Hungarian P. armeniaca orchards. Previous experiments have shown that grafting of visually healthy but
latently infected plant material leads to significantly infected progeny and
that infected progeny may remain free of symptoms for several years
(Riedle-Bauer et al., 2012). Simultaneous analysis of blackthorn and German plum leaf and
root samples led to higher rates of positive PCR results, the role of
the plant material was statistically significant. It seems that root sam-
ples are particularly appropriate for the detection of weak phyto-
plasma infections, for example, in wild Prunus hosts, even though the
sampling procedure is more time consuming. The results of the current study allow a number of practical con-
clusions with regard to control strategies. In Austria and, to a lesser
extent, also in Hungary, wild Prunus species were found infected to a
large extent. Phytoplasma types observed in wild Prunus spp. were
also prevalent in apricot orchards. Being at the same time, a preferred
host for the insect vectors wild Prunus species likely accounts for con-
siderably infected C. pruni populations threatening the health status
of cultivated Prunus trees. Our field experiments with apricot seed-
lings clearly show the speed of pathogen dissemination and underline
the need for efficient vector control. According to the transmission
experiments, there is a high risk of phytoplasma transmission from the
first day of remigration onwards as in our experiments the most effi-
cient transmission was recorded on trees in BBCH stage 03-09 kept
outside. In consequence, vector management by insecticides or repel-
lents must start at this time point and last until the end of the
remigrant flight period. In contrast to that, control of the emigrant
generation does not appear necessary. The duration of the IAP is a crucial point for successful manage-
ment of the pathogen spread by insecticides. The principal goal of
insecticide application is to keep vector populations inside the orchard
as low as possible and in consequence to minimise the pathogen
spread. However, in case of high vector numbers and continuous
immigration from overwintering sites, a direct effect of the insecticide
on pathogen transmission is essential as well. Only insecticides with a
“knock down" or instant effect on feeding behaviour and acting faster
than the minimum IAP seem suitable to provide at least some protec-
tion against inoculation of healthy trees (Paleskic et al., 2017). Based
‘on our results, compounds disrupting the insect feeding behaviour in
less than 4 hr are necessary to keep infection rates low. Last but not
least, our study indicated at least some spread via propagation mate-
rial; thus, continued efforts are needed to warrant the health status of
the planting material. All in all, control of ESFY is impeded by several factors. First,
large-scale eradication of wild Prunus species with the aim to minimise
vector populations seems hardly feasible and from an ecological point
of view which is not desirable. Second, infectious vectors migrate into
orchards for many weeks at the end of winter and at the beginning of
spring at cool temperatures and during early developmental stages of
trees. Successful vector control therefore requires active ingredients
that are effective at low temperatures at early developmental stages
of the trees and have a long lasting effect allowing insect control over

several weeks with a small number of treatments. Third, it can be
assumed that only the minority of the available insecticides disrupts
insect feeding behaviour in less than 4 hr at cool temperatures. This
applies especially for the effect of aged spraying residues (Paleskié
et al., 2017). Strategies based on clearing measures in orchards together with
the use of certified propagating material and insecticides directed
against the remigrants will likely reduce pathogen spread, but they will

 

not entirely stop new infections in orchards. Future research should
focus on long-standing field experiments proving the benefit of
insecticides and repellents against pathogen spread (Marcone et al.,
2010; Paleski¢ et al., 2017), on the effects of antagonistic microorgan-
isms (Trivedi, Trivedi, Grinyer, Anderson, & Singh, 2016) and on
the selection and/or the breeding of suitable rootstocks (Marcone
etal., 2010). ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
