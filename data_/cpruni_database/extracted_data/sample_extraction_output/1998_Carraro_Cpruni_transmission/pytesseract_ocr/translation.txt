Ermacora and E. Refatti Dipartimento di Biologia Applicata alla Difesa delle Piante, Universita degli Studi di Udine, Via delle Scienze 208, I-33100 Udine, Italy SUMMARY Experimental transmission of European stone fruit yellows phytoplasma to Japanese plum cv. ‘Ozark Premier’ was achieved using Cacopsylla pruni, caught in the field or raised on infected plants under controlled conditions. Using different groups of infectious psyllas, 89% of the inoculated test plants were infected. Both nymphs and adults were able to transmit. Insects exposed to test plants immediately after capture or raised in cages transmitted the disease. After an incubation period of 4-5 months the first test plants showed typical symptoms. Sources of inoculum, test plants and vectors were examined by PCR for the presence of phytoplasmas. Following digestion of the amplification products with restriction enzymes, isolates from plants and insects showed the same restriction profiles. Interestingly, pear decline and European stone fruit yellows, members of the apple proliferation cluster, are both transmitted by Cacopsylla spp. RIASSUNTO TRASMISSIONE DEL FITOPLASMA ASSOCIATO AL GIALLUME EUROPEO DELLE DRUPACEE A MEZZO DI CACOPSYLLA PRUNI. Si riferisce su una serie di esperimenti condotti in ambiente controllato al fine di individuare il vettore del giallume europeo delle drupacee (ESFY). Attraverso una serie di esperienze condotte in passato ed utilizzando varie tecniche di trasmissione, non era stato possibile trasmettere la malattia con nessuna delle numerose specie di insetti, principalmente cicaline, prese in considerazione. Anche mediante tecniche di biologia molecolare (PCR) non era stata messa in evidenza la presenza del fitoplasma in insetti catturati in zone infette. In seguito, in una zona del nord-est Italia ove si pratica l'agricoltura biologica, si € potuta osservare, a inizio di primavera, la presenza di Cacopsylla pruni su impianti Corresponding author: R. Osler Fax: +39.0432.558501 E-mail: osler@pldef.uniud it di susino giapponese con evidenti sintomi di ESFY. Nelle prove di trasmissione successivamente condotte si é potuto dimostrare che tale specie di psilla é vettore del fitoplasma associato a ESFY. Oltre agli adulti svernanti ed alle ninfe ¢ adulti della nuova generazione raccolti direttamente in frutteti infetti, anche ninfe ed adulti allevati in cattivita hanno trasmesso il patogeno in studio. Dopo inoculazioni multiple, 89% delle piante test (susino cv. ‘Ozark Premier’) sottoposte ad analisi mediante il test DAPI e PCR-RFLP é risultato infetto. Le stesse piante hanno anche manifestato dopo 4-5 mesi i tipici sintomi della malattia, fatta eccezione per la necrosi del floema. Sottoponendo a digestione enzimatica il DNA amplificato di fitoplasmi ottenuto dalle piante sorgente di inoculo, dalle piante test e dai vettori animali, sono stati ottenuti costantemente gli stessi profili di restrizione. Sulla base dei dati finora a disposizione, emerge che i fitoplasmi inclusi nel gruppo genetico degli scopazzi del melo (es. moria del pero e giallume europeo delle drupacee) sono trasmessi da psille. Key words: psyllids, phytoplasmas, Japanese plum, PCR, detection. INTRODUCTION Phytoplasmas are considered to be the causal agents of several stone fruit disorders, including plum leptonecrosis, decline of European plums, apricot chlorotic leaf roll, Moliére’s disease and other yellows and decline diseases of stone fruit trees (Sanchez-Capuchino and Forner, 1973; Morvan, 1977; Giunchedi e¢ al., 1982; Rumbos and Bosalidis, 1985; Dosba et al., 1990; Poggi Pollini et al, 1993; Lee et al, 1995; Marcone et al, 1996; Carraro et al., 1998b). According to Lorenz et al., (1994) such European stone fruit phytoplasma diseases are believed to have a common aetiology. The name ‘European stone fruit yellows phytoplasma’ (ESFY-P) has been proposed for the pathogen. On the basis of sequence and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA, the agent of ESFY is placed within the apple 234 Cacopsylla pruni vector of ESFY proliferation (AP) group (Schneider ef al., 1993; Seemiiller e¢ a/., 1994; Lee et al, 1995; Seemiiller e¢ al., 1998). This cluster also includes phytoplasmas associated with several perennial fruit tree diseases present in Europe such as AP and pear decline (PD). These phytoplasmas are closely related but distinguishable from each other (Jarausch ef a/., 1994; Malisano et al., 1996). ESFY-P is also distinctly different from the agents of Xdisease and peach yellow leaf roll, major phytoplasma diseases of stone fruit trees in North America which have not been shown to occur in Europe (Sinha and Chiykowsky, 1980; Kirkpatrick e¢ al, 1990; Kison et al, 1997). The possible role of any secondary phytoplasmas in the decline of stone fruit trees is under discussion (Lee et al, 1995). European stone fruit yellows was first described in Ttaly by Goidanich (1933) under the name of ‘plum leptonecrosis’. Although several species of stone fruits are susceptible to ESFY (Giunchedi et al, 1982; Poggi Pollini e¢ a/., 1995), the disease is particularly devastating for Japanese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) and apricot (P. armeniaca L.) (Desvignes and Cornaggia, 1982). The Japanese plum cultivar ‘Ozark Premier’ is highly susceptible to ESFY and was thus used as a test plant in our experiments. ESFY has caused epidemics in several areas of northeastern Italy where 50-70% of the plum trees became infected within the first three or four years of planting (Carraro ef al., 1992). In spite of the high infection pressure and the rapid spread of the disease, the natural vector(s) of ESFY remained unknown. In the early 1990s we began investigations to identify these vector(s). Initially we examined leafhoppers, but with no success (Carraro et al., 1992). More recently, many different species of leafhopper from several infected orchards in the sampling area were analyzed by PCR using AP group-specific primers. All were found to be negative for this phytoplasma (G. Firrao, personal communication). Consequently, in 1996 we started to focus attention on psyllids. In the past, several Cacopsylla spp. were found associated with pear, apple and stone fruit trees in the orchards monitored. Recent molecular work has shown that ESFY-P is affiliated to the AP group and is closely related to PD (Seemiiller et a/., 1998), which is known to be transmitted by at least two species of Cacopsylla (Jensen et al., 1964; Lemoine, 1991; Carraro et al., 1998a). C. pruni appeared to be the most common psyllid on stone fruit in the areas investigated, This paper reports the transmission of the ESFY-P by C. pruni Scopoli, either caught in an infected area and immediately used for inoculative feeding on test plants, or raised in cages under controlled conditions for transmission experiments. Journal of Plant Pathology (1998), 80 (3), 233-239 MATERIALS AND METHODS All insects tested and inoculum sources were obtained from an area where different phytoplasmas are associated with perennial fruit trees and weeds (Osler et al., 1994). Furthermore the three most prominent diseases of the AP group, i.e. AP, PD and ESFY have frequently been detected in the last 15 years in this region (Refatti e¢ al, 1986; Carraro et al., 1992; Carraro et al. 1998a, b). Except for the experiments performed with caught insects (reported in Table 1), all procedures involving C. pruni feeding were carried out in an environmentally controlled greenhouse with supplementary light to 16 h/day at 23-25°C. After inoculation, the test plants were held in separate sectors of the greenhouse. Test insects and phytoplasma transmissions. Starting from March to April, groups of overwintering adults of C. pruni were periodically captured in the sampling area, with a moving net. They were then confined in groups on the test plants. Five groups of nymphs and young adults of C. pruni, hatched on infected stone fruit trees from eggs laid in spring by the overwintering females, were also used to directly inoculate test plants (Table 1). Eight groups of 30 insects from the transmission trials were analyzed by PCR using the primers f01/r01 (Lorenz e¢ al., 1995). The amplification products were then subjected to RFLP analysis after restriction with Sspl and BsaAI. In a second experiment, hibernating insects were confined for a few days for ovideposition on two young infected ‘Ozark Premier’ plants (sources of inoculum), protected in ventilated plastic net cages. Nymphs of the third/fourth instar or young adults born in captivity on infected hosts were grouped and transferred for inoculative feeding to test plants for 13 to 20 days (Table 2). For comparison, groups of C. pruni recovered at the end of the inoculation period reported in Table 2 were exposed to either three pear or three apple seedlings, as tests plants for PD and AP. In addition, three groups of infectious C. pyri L. were transferred to ‘Ozark Premier’ test plants. After inoculative feeding, all test plants were sprayed with insecticide and held in the greenhouse for symptom development and for phytoplasma detection tests. Sources of inoculum. Experimental sources of inoculum were potted young ‘Ozark Premier’ plants inoculated by grafting in the greenhouse using ESFY-infected budwood derived from trees of symptomatic ‘Ozark Premier’ and asymptomatic but infected ‘Myrobalan’ (P. cerasifera Ehth.).

Ten pl of the PCR products were digested separately with SspI and BsaAI according to the manifacturer’s instructions (BioLabs). Restriction fragments were resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the DNA was stained with silver nitrate. Amplified DNA obtained from AP-infected apple trees and PD-infected pear trees was used for comparison in RELP analyses. RESULTS Natural host/sources of C. pruni. During March and April, overwintering adults of C. pruni were mostly Journal of Plant Pathology (1998), 80 (3), 233-239 captured on ‘Myrobalan’ suckers and plum trees. Some were also captured from apricot trees, but none were found on cherry, peach, pear or apple trees. The first captures of hibernating adults from stone fruit trees were made at the beginning of March. In May large populations of nymphs were present, expecially on ‘Myrobalan’. Test insects and phytoplasma transmission. Overwintering adults captured in spring survived in captivity for up to 2 months. The average survival during the inoculation access periods was above 90%. Judging from the large colonies of offspring, the females were very fertile and the general rearing conditions were suitable. In the first trial 2240 adults of C. pruni were caught in the field and used to inoculate 21 test plants. When analyzed by DAPI and PCR, 17 of these plants were phytoplasma-infected (Table 1). More particularly, 13 out of 16 and 4 out of 5 test plants became infected after being inoculated in spring by overwintering adults of C. pruni or nymphs and young adults born from eggs (new generation), respectively. All 17 test plants of the second experiment (Table 2) became infected after exposure to infectious psyllas, either adults or nymphs hatched in cages. Transmission efficiency of adults and nymphs was similar. The negative results of PCR analyses indicated that none of the six groups of the ESFY-P infected psyllas transmitted to pear or apple test plants. Similarly, negative results were obtained when PD-infected C. pyri were transferred to ‘Ozark Premier’ test plants. Phytoplasma detection. DAPI tests and PCR analyses gave the same results. Using primer pair fO1/rO1, ESFY-P DNA was amplified from all samples from sources of inoculum as well as from 89% of the test plants used in inoculative feeding, and from the 8 groups of infectious psyllas tested. After the digestion with SspI and BsaAI, the PCR products obtained from samples of psylla and Japanese plum always showed the same restriction profiles, distinguishable from AP and PD profiles (Fig. 1). Disease development. Four to five months after inoculation, the first symptoms of ESFY appeared on the ‘Ozark Premier’ test plants. They consisted of faint but typical leaf reddening, small leaves, irregular leafing, leafroll and thickening of the leaf blade. The partial defoliation of several plants was attributable to insect feeding damage rather than to the disease. Carraro etal. 237. Fig. 1.

The lanes 1-3 are undigested DNA respectively from ESFYp infected Japanese plum (1), AP infected apple tree (2) and PD infected pear tree (3). M: marker (Bio Rad). DISCUSSION The results show that C. pruni is a vector of the European stone fruit yellows agent. Following digestion with SspI and BsaAl, all samples (symptomatic inoculum sources, groups of psylla, and symptomatic test plants) consistently showed the same restriction profiles, which were identical to those of ESFY isolated on Catharanthus roseus by dodder (Loi et al., 1995). The data in Table 2 show the ability of C. pruni to transmit ESFY from infected to healthy plum trees under controlled conditions. In fact the vectors used for transmission were raised from eggs layed on the experimentally infected plum trees. The young adults and nymphs were then removed from these trees and used for separate inoculation experiments. It is largely accepted that vertical (=transovarial) transmission of phytoplasmas in their vector is an exception rather than the rule (Purcell, 1982). The transmission efficiency of the groups of C. pruni caught in nature and transferred to infect the test plants (Table 1) was comparable to that of insects reared on ESFY-infected ‘Ozark Premier’ plants in controlled greenhouse conditions (Table 2). This indicates that C. prunt is not only an experimental vector of ESFY-P but also a natural vector. Furthermore, C. pruni did not transmit ESFY to apple or pear test plants specific for AP and PD, nor did C. pyri transmit PD to Prunus. These data suggest that the three diseases are caused by different phytoplasmas. In fact the agents of AP, PD, and ESFY are considered to be closely related but dis238 — Cacopsylla pruni vector of ESFY tinct, all belonging to the apple proliferation cluster (Seemiiller e¢ al., 1998). The data obtained underline the biological similarities between ESFY and PD and AP: the natural spread of ESFY and PD are both mediated by Cacopsylla spp. ; recently in our laboratory the AP agent was also detected in Cacopsylla spp. (Carraro et al., unpublished results), ESFY and PD are host species-specific and we have found no cases of mixed infection, either in the host plants or in the psylla vectors. In conclusion, in the rather typical area studied, where AP, PD and ESFY spread naturally and are present in the same orchard, the three diseases are clearly distinct. Our results show that both nymphs and adults of C. pruni can transmit ESFY but we do not know yet whether in nature the overwintering adults found in spring can carry over infection from the previous year. The important question remains, whether infectivity may persist from spring to spring in psyllas, without intermediate reacquisition (recharging) (Sylvester and Osler, 1977). The potential influence of alternative host plants is also unknown. On the basis of the positive transmissions by the groups of psylla born in spring on stone fruit trees (Table 1, groups 17-21) we can assume that in nature C. pruni can acquire infectivity from infected stone fruit trees before abandoning these principal hosts. Our results show that in spring all insects can be infectious, including those found on the principal host after overwintering and those of the spring generation on infected stone fruit trees. We emphasize that the vector of ESFY-P was found in an area of organic farming where insect populations are not influenced by use of insecticides. Further investigations are necessary to study the main transmission parameters of ESFY and the life cycle of the vector. It will be necessary to rear a phytoplasma-free colony of C. pruni, taking into account that this psylla is oligofagous on Prunus, overwinters on wild plants such as conifers and has a single generation per year (Conci ef al., 1992).
