Phytoplasma-like symptoms have been observed on fruit trees in Bosnia and Herzegovina during recent years. No phytoplasma expertise and detection facilities were available locally, thus other biotic or abiotic factors were usually held responsible for the diseases. Only recently has the presence of pear decline been conﬁrmed by PCR and RFLP analyses (Duduk ., 2005a) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. et al Phytoplasma diseases – apple proliferation associated with Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’, pear decline associated with ‘ Candidatus ‘ Phytoplasma pyri’ and European stone fruit Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ yellows associated with ‘ – have been detected in neighbouring countries (Saric & et al Cvjetkovic, 1985; Tanaskovic & Carraro, 2003; Duduk ., 2005b) with which plant material is frequently exchanged. Taking this into account, the main objective of the present paper was to detect the presence and quantify the incidence of phytoplasma diseases in fruit trees in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A further objective was to assess the presence of the known psyllid vectors of fruit tree phytoplasmas, because phytoplasma diseases are particularly dangerous in areas where both infected plants (sources of inoculum) and insect vectors are present. Field surveys Surveys were carried out during autumn (October 2004) and spring (April 2005). Stone fruit, apple and pear trees were checked for symptoms of phytoplasma infection. The symptoms considered were: leaf roll, yellowing and phloem necrosis for European stone fruit yellows; witches’ broom, small leaves, enlarged stipules and reddening for apple proliferation; leaf roll, small leaves, yellowing/reddening and decline for pear decline. Several hectares of orchards in the north-western (Gradiska-Banjaluka), central southern (Sarajevo-Maglaj) areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina were Malus inspected. Samples were collected from cultivated apple ( Prunus persica pumila ), Prunus domestica apricot ( ) and from wild myrobalan ( ) and blackthorn Prunus spinosa ). Apple and pear samples were only collected ( from symptomatic trees. Different cultivars on different rootstocks from private or commercial orchards were chosen; some bordering trees were also considered. ), peach ( ), European plum ( Prunus cerasifera Prunus armeniaca Pyrus communis ), pear ( (Mostar) and To better understand the epidemiology of fruit tree phytoplasmas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, surveys were also carried out during April 2005 in the same areas to detect the presence Cacopsylla of known psyllid vectors.

Identiﬁcation of fruit tree phytoplasmas in Bosnia and Herzegovina 445 and C. picta C. pyri . Cacopsylla pruni melanoneura, Cacopsylla pyri were collected using the beating tray method. One old pear orchard C. melanoneura was chosen for collecting C. pruni were captured in abandoned apple orchards, and in abandoned plum and apricot orchards. After identiﬁcation of the collected insects under a binocular microscope, they were split into groups of 10 and 20 individuals and kept at C (in 70% ethanol) for successive laboratory analyses. and 20 − ° Serological and PCR/RFLP analyses Ca DAS-ELISA was carried out to detect ‘ samples, using the 1F4/1E2 monoclonal antibody (Loi . P. mali’ in the apple et al ., 2001). Two procedures were used for DNA extraction. The et al . phytoplasma enrichment procedure modiﬁed by Malisano (1996) was adopted for DNA extraction from leaves collected from different trees. The DNA extraction from insects was carried out according to Doyle & Doyle (1990). Nested PCR was employed for the detection of phytoplasmas both in plants and psyllids using the universal primers P1/P7 (Deng & Hiruki, 1991) followed by R16F2n/R16R2 (Gundersen & Lee, 1996). Mse The R16F2n/R2 amplicons were then digested with I restriction enzyme. Another nested PCR procedure using 16SrX phytoplasma group speciﬁc primer pair f01/r01 (Lorenz et al ., 1995) was performed, in which the PCR products were Bsa digested with the endonucleases AI and Ssp I. Candidatus ‘ Phytoplasma mali’ subtypes et al and C. picta Ca. C. melanoneura Both apple trees and psyllid vectors were analysed for the presence of ‘ P. mali’ subtypes.

The percentage of symptomatic trees was: 20 –90% in apple orchards; 6 –70% in pear orchards; 0 –50% in stone fruit orchards (Tables 1, 2 and 3). The wild species as well as the European plum trees were symptomless. Altogether, 97 samples were collected: 25 symptomatic apples, 30 symptomatic pears and 42 stone fruits.

Combining the results obtained using the two procedures, we identiﬁed in the 23 trees infected by apple proliferation the following subtypes: 14 (61%) AP/rpX-A; 6 (26%) AT-2/rpX-A; 2 (9%) AT-1/rpX-A, 1 (4%) AT-1/rpX-B.

Regarding ‘ P. mali’, PCR was found to be more sensitive than ELISA. However, serological tests can be used for largescale diagnosis, and PCR as a conﬁrmation in the case of ELISA-negative or doubtful results. The high correlation between the presence of symptoms on collected plant material and the presence of the disease agent (more than 90% of the tested samples were found infected) as well as the presence of C. melanoneura apple proliferation-infected vectors ( ), strongly indicate that the disease is epidemic in the country. The absence of strict phytosanitary controls in nurseries and fruit orchards and a widespread occurrence of psyllid vectors are facilitating the spread of apple proliferation in Bosnia and Phytoplasma Herzegovina.

Identiﬁcation of fruit tree phytoplasmas in Bosnia and Herzegovina 447 vectors in Bosnia and Herzegovina which represent a serious threat to the local fruit tree industry. Identiﬁcation de phytoplasmes pathogènes des arbres fruitiers et de leurs vecteurs en Bosnie-Herzégovine Des prospections ont été menées à l’automne 2004 et au printemps 2005 dans les zones traditionnellement dédiées à la culture des fruits à pépins et à noyaux en Bosnie-Herzégovine pour évaluer la présence, la distribution et l’incidence des maladies à phytoplasme dans les arbres fruitiers. La présence de psylles vecteurs a également été étudiée. La détection de phytoplasmes dans les échantillons de végétaux et d’insectes et leur identiﬁcation ont été menées par l’observation de symptômes au champ, et des analyses DAS-ELISA (double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), nested-PCR (nested polymerase chain reaction) et RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism). Les analyses de laboratoire ont montré la présence de phytoplasmes appartenant au : i) groupe 16SrX, sous-groupe A (‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’) dans 23 des 25 échantillons de pommiers, dans 4 groupes sur 18 de Cacopsylla picta (synonyme Cacopsylla costalis) et dans 2 groupes sur 9 de Cacopsylla melanoneura ; ii) groupe 16SrX, sous-groupe C (‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’) dans 11 des 30 échantillons de poiriers et dans 2 groupes sur 9 de Cacopsylla pyri ; iii) groupe 16SrX, sous-groupe B (‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’) dans 4 échantillons d’abricotiers, 2 de pêchers sur les 42 échantillons d’arbres fruitiers à noyaux et dans 1 groupe sur 14 de Cacopsylla pruni. La présence de différents sous-groupes de Candidatus Phytoplasma mali a ainsi été prouvée à la fois dans les pommiers et les insectes. mali’ subtypes was found to be similar to that described in Germany (Jarausch et al., 2004) where AP subtype was predominant, followed by AT-2 and AT-1 but completely different from the situation in the Trentino Alto Adige region (Italy), where the AP subtype was sporadically found (Cainelli et al., 2004). Results obtained by using the typing method proposed by Martini et al. (2005) which showed rpX-A was the predominant subtype, should be considered as preliminary and need to be conﬁrmed by extended surveys in different apple-growing areas. Although all 30 pear samples were collected from trees showing pear decline symptoms, only 11 (37%) were positive for the presence of ‘Ca. P. pyri’. This conﬁrms that symptoms of pear decline are not highly speciﬁc and can be confused with other disorders such as graft-incompatibility, chlorosis, fungal, viral or bacterial diseases. Although only 37% of the symptomatic samples were positive in laboratory analyses, pear decline was detected in almost all locations inspected. In north-western Bosnia and Herzegovina, C. pyri was found to be infected by the disease agent. In terms of single insects, the minimum rate of psyllids carrying phytoplasmas was 1.4%. Vector control appears to be of fundamental importance for reducing the spread of pear decline. The infection rate of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in symptomatic samples was 25%, and in symptomless samples 10%. In routine diagnosis and in order to obtain reliable results on the presence of the causal agent in Prunus species, the optimal time for sampling leaves is from July to September (Jarausch et al., 1999). The rather late period chosen for our survey probably inﬂuenced the low-rate detection of the phytoplasma in symptomatic apricot samples. Symptom severity of European stone fruit yellows is inﬂuenced by the rootstock. The main apricot rootstocks in Bosnia and Herzegovina are European plum and myrobolan which show intermediate susceptibility and sensitivity (Carraro et al., 2004). This could be the cause of the occurrence of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in some symptomless trees. European stone fruit yellows is a serious problem in the Mediterranean area (France, Italy, Spain), where the cultivation of susceptible and sensitive Prunus species (apricot and Japanese plum) is widespread. Consequently, the low incidence of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in Prunus species in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be correlated to the limited cultivation of these highly susceptible species. Despite its low incidence, ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ was recorded in northern and southern parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Infected C. pruni were collected in an apricot orchard where European stone fruit yellows was diagnosed. Adults were more numerous on wild Prunus species and rootstocks than on apricots. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that wild Prunus species, especially Prunus spinosa, are the preferred host plants of the vector (Carraro et al., 2002). Our results desmonstrate that both the disease and the vector are present in Bosnia and Herzegovina even if the disease incidence and the level of infectivity of C. pruni seem to be low. In conclusion, we determined the presence and the incidence of three dangerous phytoplasma diseases and their respective © 2007 The Authors.
