Preface

Since going to press a second Hippophaé-feeding Psylla species, zetterstedti (Thom-
son, 1877), has been discovered in Britain. While it has been possible to add the
species to both the check list and host plant list it has not been possible to incorporate
details in the main text. Appendix III should be consulted for a discussion of the
separation of this species. Introduction

The Psylloidea, or jumping plant-lice, are an important component of the hemip-
terous fauna of many dicotyledenous plants. At present 77 species are known to
occur in Britain. Psyllids, in general appearance, resemble miniature cicadas, and
vary in size from about 1.5 to 4.5 mm overall in length. They are characterized by
their strongly developed hind legs which are adapted for leaping. The first comprehensive work on the British Psylloidea was the monograph of
Scott (1876). This was superseded 20 years later by Edward’s (1896) monograph on
‘the Hemiptera: Homoptera of the British Isles’. Subsequent work on the British
fauna has been confined to the description of new species, publication of distribution
records and occasional additions to the British species list. Consequently, Edwards’
monograph has until now remained the standard reference work on the British
species. Most recent taxonomic work on the Psylloidea has originated on the
continent, particularly eastern Europe, and keys or monographs are now available
to the psyllids of Poland (Klimaszewski, 1969, 1975), European U.S.S.R. (Loginova,
1964), Rumania (Dobreanu & Manolache, 1962), Czechoslovakia (Vondracek,
1957), Spain (Ramirez-Gomez, 1956a, b, 1960), Austria (Haupt, 1935) and
Switzerland (Schaefer, 1949a). From these later works a much more soundly based
system of psyllid classification has emerged. The generally accepted system of classification divides the Psylloidea into six
families; namely, Triozidae, Carsidaridae, Liviidae, Aphalaridae, Spondyliaspidae
and Psyllidae. The relationships between the families and the evolution of the
group as a whole have been discussed in detail by G. Heslop-Harrison (1949c,
195ic, d, 1952b, 1958, 1959), Klimaszewski (1964), Szelegiewicz (1971) and Becker-
Migdisova (1973). All six families are known to occur in Britain although the
Carsidaridae and Spondyliaspidae are not indigenous. Most of the British species are reasonably cosmopolitan in their distribution and
occur throughout Europe. However, Aphorma bagnalli is known only from British
material. A number of species have been introduced into Britain on ornamental
trees and shrubs. These include Homotoma ficus on figs, Calophya rhois on Cotinus
cogeygria, Trioza alacris on bay, Psylla pulchella on the Judas tree, P. alaterni on
Rhamnus alaternus and Ctenarytaina eucalypti on Eucalyptus species. The latter
species belongs to the Australasian family Spondyliaspidae. The geographical
distribution of the British species both in this country and the world is given in the
confirmatory description of each species. The distribution of psyllids largely, but
not always, reflects the distribution of their host plants. Economic importance of the British Psylloidea

Psylla mali and Psylla pyricola are respectively, important pests of apple and pear. In North America P. pyricola is a known vector of both pear decline condition and
fireblight. Psylla pyri and P. pyrisuga also occur on pear in this country but are
scarce and cause less damage. Trioza apicalis causes sporadic damage to carrots on
the continent but is of little economic importance in Britain. Several other psyllid
species may occur at very high densities and cause severe damage to ornamental
shrubs and trees. These species include in particular Psyllopsis species on ash,
Psylla buxi and Spanioneura fonscolombei on box, and Trioza alacris on bay shrubs. Host plant relationships

The host plant relationships of the Psylloidea have been discussed in detail by
Eastop (1972) and Hodkinson (1974b). In the nymphal stages the Psylloidea are

2 II (Sa). HOMOPTERA

almost invariably host plant specific. Most species are associated with just one or
two host plant species within a single genus. More rarely species may occur on two
or more closely related host plant genera. Adult psyllids are more catholic in their
choice of food plant. Thus, while most adults probably remain on the host plant on
which they originated, some will disperse and feed, but not oviposit, on plants
which are unsuitable for nymphal development. This habit is highly developed in
species overwintering on shelter plants. A host plant is therefore defined as a plant
on which the psyllid species is able to complete its nymphal development. A com-
plete list of the host plants of the British species is given in Appendix I. Distinction
has not been made between those host plant species on which a given psyllid has
been recorded in Britain and known host plants which occur in Britain but on
which the psyllid has not yet been recorded. The nymphs of several British species
cause conspicuous gall or pseudo-gall formation on their host plant. Livia juncorum
induces tassel galls on Juncus spp., Psyllopsis fraxini induces roll leaf galls on
Fraxinus excelsior while Trichochermes walkeri and Trioza remota induce simple pit
galls on Rhamnus and Quercus species respectively. Life-history

The Psylloidea pass through five nymphal instars before becoming adult. All the
British species are dioecious and at emergence the sexes normally occur in a ratio
which approximates 1:1. However, females are generally longer lived than males
and this may, for a given species, bias the sex ratio in favour of females as time
progresses. The life-cycles of the British species fall into one of the four following categories:

1. Species which overwinter in the egg stage on the dormant buds of their host
plant and commence nymphal development in the spring coincident with bud
burst, e.g. Psyllopsis spp., some Psylla spp. 2. Species which overwinter as nymphs on the host plant, e.g. Strophingia spp.,
Craspedolepta spp. and Psylla ambigua. 3. Species which overwinter as adults on the host plant and which oviposit in
late winter to early spring, e.g. Psylla moscovita, Arytaina genistae. 4. Species in which the adults move on to shelter plants in the autumn and move
back on to their true host plant, possibly to mate, and oviposit in the spring,
e.g. Aphalara spp., some Psylla spp., some Trioza spp. Psyllids in category 4 utilize a wide range of evergreen shrubs and trees as over-
wintering sites. The most important plant species involved are Pinus spp., Picea spp.,
Taxus baccata L., Ulex eureopaeus L. and Juniperus communis L. The proportion of
the population of a given species which utilizes shelter plants appears to vary. Aphalara spp. are never found on their true host plant during the winter, whereas
some species such as Psylla melanoneura occur abundantly on Pinus spp. but scattered
individuals can still be found during winter on the bare stems of the true host plant,
Crataegus. Similarly, Trioza urticae occurs abundantly on evergreens but individuals
can still be found in grass tussocks at the base of the dead host plant Urtica dioica L.
In any one year the seasonal succession of species is related to the mode of over-
wintering. Hence the first species to appear as newly emerged adults are those which
overwinter as nymphs. These are followed in succession by those species overwinter-
ing as eggs and finally by those overwintering as adults. Most British psyllid species

LIFE-HISTORY 3

appear to have a single generation per year. However, Trioza urticae has at least
three generations per year whereas Strophingia ericae, at high elevations, takes two
years to complete its life-cycle. The overwintering stage (where known), the number
of generations per year and the time of adult appearance for each species is given in
Appendix II. Further information on the general biology of the Psylloidea can be
found in Hodkinson (1974b). References to individual species are given in Appen-
dix I. Methods of collecting and preserving psyllids

Adult psyllids may be collected throughout the year. During the period October to
late March sweep-netting of coniferous shelter plants is usually the most productive
collecting method. Species which overwinter on the true host plant rather than on
shelter plants can be obtained either by sweeping the known host plant, e.g. Psylla
moscovita, Arytaina genistae, or by searching among grass tussocks at the base of
the dead host plant stems, e.g. Trioza urticae. During the remainder of the year the
simplest method of obtaining adults of a given species is to locate and examine the
known host plant. Where only nymphs are present it is usually possible to bring
host plant samples, with nymphs attached, into the laboratory or greenhouse and
breed out the adults. Care should be taken to maintain fairly high humidity levels
as nymphs are highly susceptible to desiccation. When collecting psyllids it is
advisable, whenever possible, to collect both males and females of a species. In
certain genera, Psylla and Trioza in particular, the females of many species are very
similar and males are required for exact species determination. In addition, careful
note should be made of the host plant species from which the specimens are taken
as this may be a valuable taxonomic character if used judiciously. There is no ideal way of mounting and storing psyllids; each method has its
advantages and disadvantages and it is recommended that three separate collections
be made; a dry collection, a spirit collection and a slide mounted collection. Dry
specimens should be mounted on cardboard points using a water soluble glue such
as gum tragacanth. The use of micro-pins is not recommended. Dry specimens
required for colour determination tend to shrivel and important morphological
characters become. obscured. Hence a parallel collection stored in 70% ethyl
alcohol should be made, Specimens in spirit can be manipulated easily and usually
the gross morphological characters can be observed under a dissecting microscope. Such specimens, however, unless highly pigmented, tend to become discoloured. Many characters, particularly wing microsculpture, prothoracic sclerites, genitalia
and saltatorial spines, are not easily visible under the dissecting microscope and until
the reader is very familiar with the psyllids it is recommended that he or she should
examine these characters in cleared and dissected material under a compound
microscope. Psyllids for dissection should be placed in 15% potassium hydroxide
for 24 hours, washed twice for 30 minutes in distilled water, dehydrated by passing
through a series of 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100% alcohols (20 minutes in each) and
cleared in either clove or cedar-wood oil. Specimens can then be dissected easily in
a drop of clove oil ona microscope slide and mounted in Canada balsam. If perma-
nent slides are not required then a semi-permanent mountant such as polyvinyl
lactophenol or Berlese medium may be used, although clearing of specimens is still
recommended for characters stich as genitalia and propleurites. To prevent parts
such as the head and genitalia from being distorted by the weight of the cover slip,
a sufficient depth of mountant should be used. The main disadvantage with slide

4 II (Sa). HOMOPTERA

mounted material is that the constituent parts of the psyllid can be examined only
in one plane. Thus if few specimens are available, storage in spirit is the most
flexible method; slides can then be made when required. Morphology

Detailed descriptions of psyllid anatomy can be found in Crawford (1914), Weber
(1929), Tuthill (1943), Vondracek (1957) and Matsuda (1970, 1976). The following
simplified account describes those important morphological characters used in the
construction of the keys. The general features of a psyllid head are illustrated in figs 1 and 2. In certain
families such as the Psyllidae and Triozidae the genae are developed into a pair of
anteriorly directed processes known as genal cones, and the frons, which bears the
median ocellus is enveloped between their bases. In other families, such as the
Aphalaridae (figs 44, 23), the genae are not developed into cones and the frons is
visible as a free sclerite on the underside of the head. In the family Liviidae (fig. 7)
the vertex is elongate and cleft anteriorly. Care should be taken not to confuse this
development of the vertex with the genal cones. Where genal cones are present
there is generally a distinct suture between the vertex and the base of the genae
which often lie in a plane below that of the vertex. The size, shape and relative
proportions of the head and its appendages are all useful taxonomic characters. The thoracic features of taxonomic importance are illustrated in figs 1 and 2. The pronotum is usually broadly transverse, reaching its maximum development in
the Liviidae. The position of the propleurites relative to the pronotum and the
relative size and shape of the prothoracic epimeron and episternum are generally
good taxonomic characters. The parypterae are normally tubercular but in Livia
and Aphorma they are developed into flat quadrate plates which fit into the lateral
angles of the mesothoracic praescutum and scutellum. The relative size and shape
of the metathoracic sclerites is comparatively uniform throughout the Psylloidea
and such characters have not been used in the keys. The psyllid hind wings are small, thin and membranous and are of little use in
the taxonomy of the group. The forewings, however, provide several useful charac-
ters. The basic Psylla-type venational arrangement is illustrated in fig. 3. The main
modifications to this basic plan are first that the pterostigma may be absent, with
vein Rs meeting the costa approximately mid-way along the costal margin, e.g. Aphalara spp. (fig. 36), Trioza spp. (fig. 238); second the stalk of M and Cu (M+ Cu)
may be absent so that veins M and Cu arise directly at vein R, e.g. Trioza spp. (fig. 238). In many species the membrane of the forewing is covered in minute cuticular
protruberances termed spinules, The presence and distribution of spinules on the
upper surface of the wing membrane is a valuable character in specific determina-
tion. In genera such as Trioza the spinules are of two types; the larger radular
spinules, which occur in distinct V-shaped clusters in the cells around the apical
and anal margin of the wing (fig. 238) and the smaller surface spinules which are
distributed over the membrane and which may be present or absent. Other impor-
tant forewing characters include shape, texture and pattern, relative length and
shape of veins, relative shape and size of cells, the presence or absence of a costal
break and the point at which vein Cu, meets the hind margin. The basal width to
height ratio of cell cu; (fig. 3) is a particularly useful character for separating certain
critical groups of species such as the Psylla mali-peregrina-sorbi complex. MORPHOLOGY 5

of veins. The pro- and mesothoracic legs are simple and of little taxonomic significance. The metathoracic legs (fig. 4), however, are highly modified for jumping and provide
several useful characters. Each metacoxa is large and usually bears a characteristic
posteriorly directed process, the meracanthus. The meracanthus, however, is absent
in Rhinocola and Camarotoscena. The metatibiae often possess an outer basal
genual spine or tubercle but this is absent in a genus such as Psyllopsis. The number
of thick black saltatorial spines at the apex of the metatibia (fig. 4) varies from three
in certain Trioza species to a maximum of ten in Psyllopsis. Similarly, the number of
thick black saltatorial spines on the basal metatarsus (fig. 4) varies from a maximum
of two in Psylla spp. to one in Arytaina spp. and none in Aphorma and Trioza. The psyllid abdomen in general lacks good taxonomic features except for the
terminalia, The male terminalia (fig. 5) are simple, consisting of a subgenital plate, a
proctiger, a single pair of parameres and a folding aedeagus or penis. The proctiger,
which bears the anus apically, is usually unipartite, though in Homotoma and
Ctenarytaina it is bipartite. In genera such as Psylla the proctiger approximates a

lobes or processes. In Psyllopsis (fig. 92) and certain Trioza spp. (fig. 283) the process
takes the form of a simple lobe whereas in Aphalara and Craspedolepta spp. the
process is narrow and elongate (figs 39, 65). The male subgenital plate is highly uniform in shape throughout the Psylloidea
and is of little taxonomic significance. The size and shape of the male parameres,
however, is probably the single most important specific character in the Psylloidea. The shape of the parameres is highly variable, ranging from simple lamellate
structures in species such as Psylla melanoneura (fig. 189) to rather complex structures
in Craspedolepta subpunctata (fig. 64) and Psyllopsis spp. (fig. 95). The form of the
apical part of the penis has limited taxonomic significance but is useful in certain
instances for separating highly characteristic species, e.g. Trioza chenopodii. The female terminalia (fig. 6) consist of a dorsal outer acuminate valve or
proctiger and an outer shorter ventral valve or subgenital plate. These valves enclose
the palps which in turn enclose the valvulae ventralis and ovipositor. The female
proctiger bears the anus basally. The anus is circumscribed by the peri-anal ring, a
ring of wax-secreting pores, the form of which is fairly constant in most genera, but
of great taxonomic significance in Aphalara. The general shape of the female proc-
tiger and subgenital plate is fairly uniform throughout the Psylloidea and within
certain genera the female genitalia of several species may appear almost identical,
e.g. several Salix-feeding Psylla species. However, the length and shape of the outer
valves can be, in certain instances, a useful character for the separation of species. The form of the palps, valvulae ventralis and ovipositor are generally of little
taxonomic value. In adult Psylloidea the two sexes are usually of similar coloration, but in a few
Trioza spp., ¢.g. T. chenopodii, the sexes may be colour dimorphic. For most psyllid

species with long-lived adults the full adult coloration may take several months to
develop. For instance, adult Psylla peregrina and P. mali, which emerge in June
have a green body coloration. They remain green until the end of July when they
begin to darken. By late September the have turned red and brown. Similarly
species which overwinter as adults, e.g. Psylla pulchra, P. moscovita, are much darker
in colour in spring than at the onset of winter. Hence coloration characters have
only been used in the key couplets when they are known to be constant. The con-
firmatory description of each species in the key indicates, where appropriate, the
range of colour variation in post-teneral adults. Nymphal taxonomy

The nymphal stages of many species of psyllid have been described in detail but no
attempt has been made to produce a coherent nymphal taxonomy. Scott described
the immature stages of some of the British species but his descriptions are inadequate
for precise specific determinations. Ossiannilsson’s key to the fifth instar nymphs
of the Scandinavian Psylla spp. (Ossiannilsson, 1971) is the only satisfactory key
available for the identification of British species. However, nymphal taxonomy is
extremely difficult and the non-specialist will probably find it easier to breed nymphs
through to the adult stage for identification. A complete list of references to larval
descriptions of British species is given in Appendix I. Check list of British psyllids

The literature on the British psyllids is widely scattered and contains much nomen-
clatorial confusion, Fortunately we have been able to examine all the major psyllid
collections on which data have been published. The following compilation rep-
resents as complete a list of names as possible which have found their way into the
British literature, together with their interpretation by British authors. However, in
addition to the references quoted there are a considerable number of records
published in local natural history society journals. It has been impossible to trace
and check all the specimens involved, but the records invariably relate to common
species. The probable synonymies can be interpreted from this check list. The present list contains a number of modifications to Kloet & Hinck’s (1964)
check list. Three species, Strophingia cinereae Hodkinson, Craspedolepta pilosa
(Oshanin), and Calophya rhois (Léw) have been added, and a number of species
have been removed or sunk in synonomy. Craspedolepta pilosa was an obvious
omission (see Ossiannilsson, 1963). Calophya rhois, however, was recorded by
G. Heslop-Harrison (1937a), from Scalpay in the Hebrides on its introduced host
plant Cotinus coggygria (= Rhus cotinus). The exact systematic position of the genus
Calophya is uncertain: Becker-Migdisova (1973) places it in the subfamily Calo-
phyinae of the Carsidaridae whereas Vondracek (1957) and Loginova (1964) place
it in the family Psyllidae. The nymph of C. rhois is not psylline in form but we have
for simplicity included the genus in the family Psyllidae. We can find no evidence to support the inclusion of Psylla colorata Léw, Trioza
dispar Léw, T. femoralis Férster and T. striola Flor on the British list. The inclusion
of T. dispar and T. striola was based on material from the Scott collection sent to
Dr F. Ossiannilsson for determination. These specimens do not bear locality
labels and probably represent foreign material, an abundance of which resides in

 

10 II (Sa). HOMOPTERA

the Scott collections. Dr Ossiannilsson (pers. comm.) knows of no other genuine
British records. Scott’s (1882b) reference to T. unifasciata Low, a synonomy of
T. striola (Vondracek, 1957), most probably refers to T. curvatinervis Forster, as he
lists striola as a non-British species on the next line. Trioza femoralis Forster ? was retained in the Kloet & Hincks list on the grounds
that Edwards (1896) gave the host plant of 7. acutipennis (Zetterstedt), a closely
related species, as Alchemilla vulgaris, a known host plant of femoralis (see Ossian-
nilsson, 1963). We have now seen true 7. acutipennis taken from Alchemilla xantho-
clora Rothm, and thus T. femoralis has been deleted. A number of species have been sunk in synonymy: Psylla léwii Scott = P.
melanoneura Forster, P. concinna Edwards = P. pulchella Léw, (Hodkinson, 1974a),
P. venata Edwards = P. hartigi (China, 1929) while P. pyricola Férster has page
priority over P. simulans Forster. Trioza maura Forster of British authors is without doubt a synonym of Trioza
curvatinervis Férster. The former was introduced onto the British list by Bagnall
(1916a). His teneral female specimens, identified by J. W. Heslop-Harrison, were
collected off Salix on the shores of Little Haweswater Lake near Silverdale. The
present author swept these trees regularly over a four year period and collected only
T. curvatinervis, a species not recorded by Bagnall (see Hodkinson, 1974a, 1976). Moreover, the Salix trees in question are broad leaf species, the host plant of
T. curvatinervis: T. maura feeds on narrow leaf Salices (Vondracek, 1957). G.
Heslop-Harrison (1936 a, b.) also records T. maura from Scotland and Northumbria. These specimens are lost but we have examined a series labelled 7. maura collected
by Heslop-Harrison at Estelle in Spain 1953: they are all T. curvatinervis. The British records of Psylla costalis Flor all relate to either the red and brown
autumnal forms of P. peregrina Forster and P. sorbi (L.), or to specimens of P.
melanoneura Férster having a dark pterostigma. This species must therefore be
removed from the list. Ossiannilsson (1963) suggested that the British form of Psylla moscovita Andria-
nova feeding on Salix repens may be distinct. Dr Marianna Loginova (Leningrad)
has kindly examined specimens collected by Heslop-Harrison at Ross-Links,
Northumbria, and by ourselves at Ainsdale, Merseyside, and she states this material
is true moscovita, Adult Trioza proxima Flor still remain unknown in Britain and the
retention of this species on the list is only justified by Bagnall’s (1916b) record of a
Trioza nymph feeding on Hiercacium pilosella (a known host plant) at Penshaw Hill
near Sunderland. Two species still remain problematical. Bagnall (1934) refers to Psylla ptarmicae
Kieffer forming galls on Achillea ptarmica in Co. Durham. Klimaszewski (1973),
in the check list of Palaearctic psyllids, regards P. ptarmicae as a nomen dubium. It
seems probable therefore that Bagnall’s record refers to Craspedolepta nervosa
(Forster), a species which is known to feed on Achillea ptarmica. Psylla bagnalli
Heslop-Harrison has only ever been recorded by the Heslop-Harrison family. For a
species which they state is so common (see Heslop-Harrison, G. 1936a, b, c, 1937b;
Heslop-Harrison, J. W. & G., 1940), it is surprising that it has not appeared in
other collections made in areas where it is known to occur. Moreover, the given host
plant, Juncus spp., for reasons stated earlier (Hodkinson, 1974a) seems somewhat
improbable. P. bagnalli is probably a synonym of an established species, although
in the absence of male material some doubt must remain and we have reluctantly
retained the species in our list. However, we have been unable to include P. bagnalli
in our key to Psylla spp. CHECK LIST. soy

Use of the keys

Two separate sets of keys to genera are provided. For those who just wish to quickly
name a specimen a simple highly artificial key to genera is provided (p.15). This
gives little indication of generic relationships but will work satisfactorily for most
specimens. For users wishing to understand the taxonomy of the group, a more
complete set of keys to families and genera is provided (p.16). In all keys except those
to species of Psylla and Trioza additional confirmatory descriptions are given in
brackets following the couplet statements. In the large genera Psylla and Trioza the
confirmatory descriptions follow the key. Abbreviations used in keys

HW=head width
WL= forewing length
GCV=genal cone length : vertex length ratio
AHR=antennal length :head width ratio
CUR =basal width :height ratio of cell cu, of forewing
FPHW=female proctiger length :head width ratio
WLHW= forewing length :head width ratio

Family Liviidae

A small Holarctic-Oriental family containing 22 species in the single genus Livia
Latreille. Members of this family, which are easily recognized by the shape of the

species of the genera Juncus and Carex. Two species, L. juncorum (Latreille) and
L. credfeldensis (Mink), are found in Britain. Prior to 1974, L. crefeldensis was placed
in a separate genus, Diraphia Waga. However, in a recent revision of the world
Liviidae, Loginova (1974a) combined the two genera. Genus Livia Latreille

Middle Asia, Armenia, Georgia. Genus Strophingia Enderlein

A western palacarctic genus containing four described species, all associated with
plants of the family Ericaceae (Loginova, 1976b). In the past Strophingia has often
been considered synonymous with Aphalaroida, (Crawford, 1914), a nearetic genus
containing several species which occur on Leguminosae in the southern U.S.A. Recent evidence suggests that the two genera are distinct. In Britain Strophingia ericae exists as two distinct physiological races which are
morphologically almost identical (Parkinson & Whittaker, 1975). The high altitude
race, which occurs above about 1,000 ft has a two-year life-cycle, while the low
altitude race occurs below 1,000 ft and has a one-year life-cycle (Hodkinson, 1973a,
b). Members of this genus are among the smallest psyllids, being less than 2 mm in
length. 1 Forewing (fig. 28) somewhat rhomboidal, without maculation; cell me twice as large as
cell cu:. Head in lateral view extending anteriorly only a short distance beyond the

Common throughout Britain. Throughout the Palaearetie from Europe to Japan. On Polygonum and Rumex spp. Certain authors (e.g. Klimaszewski, 1975) regard A. polygoni var. rumicicola Loginova
(1962) (a nomen nudum) as a distinct species living on Rumex. This form can be distin-
guished from A. polygoni form typica by the following characters. Female with posterior
portion of peri-anal wax gland bearing a double row of pores (fig. 52) as opposed to 6-8
rows in form typica (fig. 51). Apex of male paramere rounded (fig. 43) as opposed to flat-
tened in form fypica. In both sexes the wing membrane, veins and surface spinules are lighter
coloured in var. rumicicola than in form typica. The status of A. rumicicola as a distinct
species, however, is somewhat dubious as intermediate forms occur with a combination of
the above characters. Furthermore we have collected form typica from Rumex acetosella,

 

 

 

 
   

Genus Craspedolepta Enderlein

A large holarctic genus associated with plants of the families Compositae and
Onagraceae (Klimaszewski, 1973; Russell, 1973). Seven species are known to occur
in Britain. Craspedolepta flavipennis (Forster) was described partly from British material
collected in S. England and S. Ireland. These still remain the only records for the
species in Britain, but the original specimens are lost. The following account of
C. flavipennis is based on material collected by Dr Eger in the Valais, Switzerland. British material of C. pilosa (Oshanin) differs from the type-series in having the
long setae on the body and forewing up to 0.06 mm as opposed to 0,03 mm in
length (see Wagner, 1947; Vondracek, 1952). Key to species

Uncommon, S. England. Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Caucasus. Genus Psylla Geoffroy

A very large genus having a world-wide distribution on a wide variety of host plants:
28 species occur in Britain. This is a particularly ‘difficult’ genus, and specimens,
once identified, should be checked carefully against the confirmatory description
following the key. Particular attention should be paid to the male genitalia. Host
plant data given in the key refer to the true host plants: many species will also be
found on shelter plants, particularly during the winter. The key will not work, in
certain instances, for teneral specimens and these should be identified on the male
genitalia. Klimaszewski (1975) has split the genus Psylla as presently conceived
into Psylla sensu stricto and Cacopsylla Ossiannilsson but this division does not
appear to hold when the world fauna is considered. Key to species

Genus Trioza Forster

A very large diverse genus distributed throughout the world and associated with a
wide variety of host plants. Seventeen species occur in Britain, Males are often
required for specific determination. Klimaszewski (1975) split the genus Trioza as
presently conceived into Trioza sensu stricto, Heterotrioza and Bactericera. Some
of the characters he used are of dubious significance and these divisions are not
followed here. Confirmatory descriptions of each species follow the key. Figs 234-237. Trichochermes walkeri. 234, forewing. 235, 3 genitalia. 236, head. 237, @ terminalia. TRIOZA 63

recently collected specimens of T. curvatinervis from Glen Affric, Scotland, which have
genal cones somewhat intermediate between the two designated subspecies. Further-
more, these specimens have broader forewings than is normal for the species. Uncommon, throughout Britain, Ireland. Throughout Europe except in extreme

Tuthill (1952) but the possession of certain basic characters warrants its inclusion
in the Spondyliaspidae (see Helslop-Harrison, 1954; Tuthill & Taylor, 1955). These characters include the bipartite male proctiger, the open pterostigma and the
well-developed pre-occipital lobes. iti,

Appendix I

A list of psyllid host plants together with references
to biology and nymphal descriptions

Nomenclature of host plants follows Tutin ef al. (1964) (Flora Europaea). No
distinction has been made between native and non-native host plants as many of
the latter have been introduced into this country as ornamentals (see Bean, 1973). Only the main references which make a substantial contribution to our knowledge
of the biology of the species are listed: much additional information of a mainly
anecdotal nature can be found in many of the references listed in the bibliography. A vast literature has accumulated on the economically important species and the
relevant references have been selected. Biological information on certain species
(indicated*) given by Lal (1934a) is open to question, as he appears to have con-
fused closely related forms. In the list of nymphal descriptions the letters D, I and S
are used to indicate respectively a description, an illustration, and a note on sex
determination,

Appendix TIT
Description and separation of Psylla zetterstedti

Psylla zetterstedtt is close to P. hippophaes and keys out satisfactorily as far as the
second alternative in couplet 9 (p.44). In common with P. hippophaes (couplet 10)
zetterstedti possesses both the bowed paramere (fig. 320) and the long genal cones
(fig. 319) and these characters should be used to differentiate it from P. betulae,
P, subferruginea, P, hartigi and P. pruni (couplets 11-13). However, the general body
coloration is red, brown and dirty white and the female proctiger length: ventral
valve length ratio is less than 1,76 and this may lead to confusion, Hence the follow-
ing additional list of P. zetterstedti characters should facilitate separation from those
species contained in couplets 11-13. Forewing (fig. 318) broad, oblong-oval;
pterostigma short spinules absent from narrow bands adjacent to veins, cell cus
relatively high, Larger species; head width greater than 0.86 mm,
The following couplet will separate zetterstedti from hippophaes:

1 Forewing (fig. 318) relatively broad basally, cell c+-sc large; cell cu; high, basal width to
hei i than 1.55; orange-yellow coloration of wing more intense towards
head width ratio less than 1.6. Male paramere long and slender

(Natural History) have provided constant encouragement, and their comments on
the draft manuscript have greatly improved the presentation. The errors that may
still remain are our own. Dr F. Ossiannilsson (Uppsala) generously provided
material of species which were poorly represented in British collections and together
with Dr M. Loginova (Leningrad) commented on several problematical specimens. Finally we thank Mrs E. Hodkinson for the onerous task of reading the final drafts. This work was supported by grant No. GR3/2566 to the first author from the Natural
Environment Research Council. References

HANDBOOKS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF BRITISH INSECTS
World List abbreviation: Handbk Ident. Br. Insects
Published by the

ROYAL ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON
41 Queen’s Gate,
London, SW7 SHU

The aim of this series is to provide illustrated keys to the insects of Britain
together with concise morphological, bionomic and distributional information. Each handbook should serve both as an introduction to a particular group of insects
and as an identification manual. Eleven volumes are planned, each of which will be issued in separately paginated
parts as manuscripts become available. The proposed volumes are:

I. Part 1. General introduction Part 9. Ephemeroptera

2. Thysanura 10. Odonata

3, Protura 11. Thysanoptera
4. Collembola 12. Neuroptera

5. Dermaptera and Orthoptera 13. Mecoptera

6. Plecoptera 14. Trichoptera

7. Psocoptera 15. Strepsiptera

8. Anoplura 16. Siphonaptera

Il. Hemiptera
III. Lepidoptera
IV. and V, Coleoptera
VI. Hymenoptera: Symphyta and Aculeata
VII. Hymenoptera: Ichneumonoidea
VIII. Hymenoptera: Cynipoidea, Chalcidoidea, Proctotrupoidea and
Ceraphronoidea
IX. Diptera: Nematocera and Brachycera
X. Diptera:Cyclorrhapha
