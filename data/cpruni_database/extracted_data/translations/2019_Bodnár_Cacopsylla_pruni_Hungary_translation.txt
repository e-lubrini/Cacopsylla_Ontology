SUMMARY

European Stone Fruit Yellows (ESFY) phytoplasma disease causes an increasing amount of damage. This is especially true to the Génci

growing region, The insect vector of the disease, which has been shown to have a vector role during transmission experiments, is the plum
psyllid (Cacopsylla pruni). In 2018, during the swarming period of plum psyllid, in 3 different settlements (Boldogk6varalja, Nagyvarad and
Bekecs) 265 psyllidswere collected, from which 165 were plum psyllid. Molecular biology studies showed 106 individuals infected with

phytoplasma, of which 20 were males and 86 were females. Keywords: plum psyllid, infected phytoplasma

INTRODUCTION

European Stone Fruit Yellows (ESFY)
phytoplasma disease causes more and more problems
in stone fruit orchards, especially in apricot plantations. The importance of the damage caused by the pathogen
(‘Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum’) is priority in the Génci
apricot growing region since this growing region gives
near the 40% of the national apricot yield. Within the
Génci growing region there are two settlements are
highly important since the 80% of the apricot orchards
of this growing region are inside the administrative
border of Boldogkévaralja and Génc. 55-70% of
infection in Bekecs and 77% of infection in
Boldogkévaralja were determined in apricot orhards in
2009 (Tarcali et al., 2010). So far the only known vector, of which vector role
was proved by transmissional experiments, is the plum
psyllid (Cacopsylla pruni). Their feeding habit is
oligophagous, related to Prunus species (Ripka, 2010). Their occurrence is more frequent in warmer regions. However, in Hungary the species have not become
expansively spread, their occurrence was reported from
Vas, Somogy, Pest and Borsod-Abauj-Zemplén
counties. Though there are efforts to cure the disease:
treatment with penicillin derivatives (Kuroli, 1970),
treatment with tetracyclin derivatives (Davis-Clark,
1994; Douglas, 1993), water-bath treatment (Salazar-
Javashinge, 2001), in vitro shoot tip culture (Faccioli-
Colalongo, 2002), callus culture (Méllers-Sarkar,
1989), examintations of interaction between
phytoplasma strains of different virulence and its
impact on the development of cross protection
(Tibenszkyné, 2015), but for now these methods have
no satisfactory results in practice. Therefore, emphasis
should be placed on the use of aseptic propagation
material, prevention and to prevent the spreading of the
disease. One important tool of these is the protecting
against the vector. The aim of our research is to survey the infection
rate of the vector, in the case of both the nyphms and
the imagos on as many areas as possible. Additionally,

we also want to check exactly which strains of pathogen
is carried by the infected individuals, and how the
vectors use the areas. In our opinion, the deeper
knowledge of these is very important for the
development of a suitable defense-method. For the sake
of the cause, we started an overall, multi-faceted study. Within the scope of this article, only an examination of
the infection rate of collected plum psyllids is presented
as the molecular biology studies related to the rest of
the experiment is still in progress. MATERIALS AND METHODS

The swarming time of plum psyllids (Cacopsylla
pruni) was in the period between 2018, April 13. and
May 10. During this time vectors were collected in
three different settlements (Nagyvarad, Bekecs and
Boldogkévaralja). Vectors were captured by aspirator
and placed in small plastic tubes which contained 70%
medical alcohol, these tubes were kept in a refrigerator
until the laboratory tests. Collected individuals were
identified under laboratory conditions with the help of
an lightmycroscope, each one get a laboratory code,
there were also recorded if any interesting thing were
seen on them (eg. darker or lighter colors than species-
specific, or smaller than the average), We extraxt the
DNA of each individual one by one, but in the case of
PCR, in some cases we worked with groups, and after
we found that the bulk gave positive results to the
infection, we also tested them individually, that we can
found the concret individual from the bulk which gave
positive result. In the case of the individuals that were
captured in Bekecs and Nagyvarad, the psyllids were
PCR tested by individually, but in the case of which
were captured in Boldogkévaralja, for the first step we
made groups from the DNA 5 individuals in each
groups, if the group proved to be positive, the contained
individuals’ DNA were retested one by one from the
group during PCR to found the exact infected
individual. This early step was necessary because of the
huge number of individuals. ACTA AGRARIA DEBRECENIENSIS 2019-2

DNA extraction was performed by the general
extraction method used for DNA extraction of vetors:
1 200 wl (or = 500s pl) ~—S CTAB
(cetyltrimethylammounium bromide) buffer was
preheated to 60°C. Mortars were soaked in 5% hydrochloric acid for
20 minutes and then rinsed with distilled water for
sterilization and held on ice. The insect was homogenized by liquid nitrogen in
the sterilized braying mortar, then washed with
the prepared buffer into centrifuge tube and
incubated for 30 minutes in a 60°C water bath. After the water bath, it was centrifugated at
12000 rpm for 3 (or 1) minutes at room
temperature. Subsequently, the supernatant
mixture (500 11) was aspirated and transferred to
clean Eppendorf tube. To this a unit (500 yl)
chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) solution
was added. After 3 minutes of gentle shaking, the mixture was
centrifugated at 8 000 (or 12000) rpm for 8
minutes at room temperature. (At this stage it is
important not to brake when the centrifuge is
stopped to prevent mixing). Supernatant was transferred to clean Eppendorf
tube and a unit of isopropanol (-20°C) was added. After a few seconds shaking it was centrifugated
at 13 000 (or 12 500) rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C. Arisen supernatant was poured off and 300 ul of
70% ethanol (-20°C) was added to the pellet and
after a few minutes shaking it was centrifugated at
12 500 (or 10 000) rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Arisen supernatant was poured off and the
resulted DNA pellet was dried under vacuum or at
room temperature. Ethanol free, dried pellet (no
scent) was dissolved in 50 (or 100) yl of TE buffer

(or distilled water) and stored at 4°C (if tested in
the same day) or -20°C (if stored in a longer time). Universal primer pairs were used for the infection
test (R16F2n/RI6R2 for the first PCR and PCR
FUS/RU3 for the nested PCR). Table 1

In 2018, during the swarming period, 265 psyllids
were collected, from which 165 were plum psyllid
(Cacopsylla pruni). 18 young adults (freshly hatched)
and 14 nymphs were also collected. From the collected
plum psyllids 106 individuals were found to be infected
with phytoplasma, identified by molecular biological
studies with universal primers. From this 106
individuals 20 were males and 86 were females (Figure
1). Figure 1: Some of the collected individuals on microscopic picture

   

Eight of the young adults, and eight of the nymphs
gave positive results to phytoplasma infection. The number of plum psyllids collected from the
areas of Bekecs were 14 individuals, of which 11 were
females and 3 were males. All the males of the collected
plum psyllids were found on apricot and were
phytoplasma infected. Out of the females, 4 were
infected with phytoplasma, which were also collected
from apricot trees (Figure 2). In the case of collected

plum psyllids from Bekecs 36.6% of the collected
female individuals, and 100% of the male individuals
were infected. In the areas of Oradea, only one female Cacopsylla
pruni was collected, which was proven to be
phytoplasma infected. In these areas, it seems valuable
to further examine the presence of the vector and the
rate of their infection later. ACTA AGRARIA DEBRECENIENSIS 2019-2

In the areas of Boldogkévaralja, 150 plum psyllids,
and also 18 young adults and 14 nymphs were
collected. Out of the imagos 98 individuals (from
which 81 females and 17 males), 8 of the young imagos
and also 8 of the nymphs were phytoplasma infected
(Figure 3). Figure 2: Phytoplasmal infection of the collected individuals

From the plum _psyllids collected in
Boldogkévaralja 48.50% of the females and 32.07% of
the males were phytoplasma infected. Additionally, in
the case of nypmhs 57.14% and in the case of young
adults 44.44% were phytoplasma infected from the
collected individuals. CONCLUSION

Since Cacopsylla pruni’s vector role is known in
the case of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’
phytoplasma and in earlier study (Bodnar et al., 2016),
we proved the presence of this pathogen on the same
areas, the infection of the tested individuals presumable
caused by this pathogen. The high rate of infection in populations in the area
explains both the cases of Bekecs and Boldogkévaralja
for the rapid and explosive spread of apricot
phytoplasmic disease. The range of phytoplasma infected reimmigrant C.
pruni was 15% in France in the highest range, but it was
3% only in generally (Yvon et al., 2004). The infection
range is higher in Turkey with its 23% (Serge et al.,
2011). The infection range in Hungary, uniformly was
about 15% (in males and females) and somewhat higher
16% in nypmhs (Mergenthaler at al., 2017). In
comparison with these infection ranges, the ranges that
were found in this study were much higher. Based on the results of my parallel study (see:
Status survey of apricot plantations for ESFY and its
vector in the Génci growing region), the high infection
rate of the plum psyllid population is not always
attributable exclusively to the high, rapidly spreading

100 infection in the plantation. It is important, therefore, to
80 86 81 examine all factors relevant to a particular plantation
that may be involved in the pathogens entering or
60 rapidly spreading in order to establish a suitable
4 6 defense method for preventing the spread of the
