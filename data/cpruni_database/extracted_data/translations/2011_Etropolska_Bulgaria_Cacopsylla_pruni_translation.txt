Abstract

The spread and the frequency of individuals from the psyllid genus Cacopsylla has been investigated in spring 2011 in four fruit
tree orchards in three different regions of Bulgaria. Insects were captured and identified morphologically for species determina-
tion. Phytoplasma infection in psyllid samples was analysed by universal and specific PCR. All psyllid species described as vec-
tors of fruit tree phytoplasmas were present in the investigated areas. Four individuals of Cacopsylla pruni from two different
regions were carrying ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’, the agent of European stone fruit yellows (ESFY). This is the first

ESFY detection in these regions in Bulgaria. Key words: ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’, European stone fruit yellows, psyllid vectors, PCR detection

Introduction

A few species of the psyllid genus Cacopsylla (Hemip-
tera Psyllidae) have been demonstrated to be vectors of
European fruit tree phytoplasmas: ‘Candidatus Phyto-
plasma mali’ associated with apple proliferation (AP),
‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’, the agent of
European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) and ‘Candidatus
Phytoplasma pyri’, the agent of pear decline (PD)
(Scemiiller and Schneider, 2004). Two psyllids, Cacop-
sylla picta (Foerster) and Cacopsylla melanoneura (Fo-
erster) are recognised vectors of ‘Ca. P. mali’. The psyl-
lid Cacopsylla pruni Scopoli was described as vector of
‘Ca. P. prunorum’ whereas three psyllid species are
recognised or presumed vectors of ‘Ca. P. pyri’: Cacop-
sylla pyri (L.), Cacopsylla pyricola (Foerster) and Ca-
copsylla pyrisuga (Foerster) (reviewed by Jarausch and
Jarausch, 2010). ESFY and PD have been first detected in Bulgaria near
Plovdiv (Topchiiska et a/., 2000). But so far no report
exists concerning cases of infected psyllid species in Bul-
garia. AP has been reported to occur in Bulgaria since
long time (www.eppo.org); however the Cacopsylla spe-
cies vectoring fruit tree phytoplasmas were described in
Bulgaria before they have been identified as phytoplasma
vectors (Harizanov, 1966a; 1966b; 1982). However al-
most nothing is known about the incidence and the spread
of these quarantine diseases in Bulgaria. Therefore, the
aim of the present work was to gain first information on
the spread and frequency of psyllid vector species and to
determine their natural infection status in selected fruit
tree orchards in Bulgaria. Materials and methods

A survey was conducted in spring 2011 in four fruit tree
orchards in three different regions in Bulgaria. Insects
were caught using sweep-netting. Captured psyllids were
frozen at -20°C and psyllid species identification was

done using different determination keys (Hodkinson and
White, 1979; Ossiannilsson, 1992; Burckhardt and
Jarausch, 2007). DNA was extracted from single psyllid
individuals with a CTAB-based protocol as described by
Maixner et al. (1995). PCR amplification of phytoplasma DNA was achieved
with universal ribosomal primers fU5/P7 (Lorenz et al.,
1995; Schneider et al., 1995). For specific PCR of posi-
tive C. pruni, ESFY-specific non-ribosomal primers
ECAI/ECA2 were applied (Jarausch et al., 1998). Results and discussion

In the surveyed fruit tree orchards all known and puta-
tive psyllid vectors of fruit tree phytoplasmas were iden-
tified: C. pruni, C. picta, C. melanoneura, C. pyri, C.
pyrisuga and C. pyricola. They were captured in three
different region: Dupnica, Sofia (Gorni Lozen, Vra-
jdebna), and Plovdiv. (figure 1, table 1). fa edu

* PCR positive versus total number of individuals tested;

In total, 440 individuals of the six Cacopsylla species
were collected in the different fruit tree orchards and
individually analysed for phytoplasma presence. Among
the different known and putative vector species, only 4
individuals of C. pruni were found to be infected by
phytoplasmas with universal ribosomal primers. The
specific PCR revealed the presence of ‘Ca. P. prun-
orum’ in all four phytoplasma-infected C. pruni insects. Interestingly, the infected specimens originated from
two different collection sites. This is the first report of
ESFY detection in these regions. Discussion

Psyllid species described in Bulgaria by Harizanov
(1966a, 1966b, 1982) were from different regions from
those investigated in the present study. In all surveyed
orchards an important number of psyllid vector species
was found; the collected specimens showed variations in
presence and abundance at the different sites. In two of
the investigated pear orchards (Dupnica and Gorni Lozen,
table 1) only C. pyrisuga and C. pyricola were present
while at the location of Vragdebna C. pyri was the only
pear psyllid species found. Despite abundances of C. pyri
and C. pyrisuga, none of the individuals captured during
this preliminary survey was phytoplasma infected. The
detection of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in its vector species in two
different regions indicates a broader distribution of ESFY
in Bulgaria as known so far. The future investigations
will aim to monitor regularly insects and plants in these
regions and other fruit tree growing areas in Bulgaria for
possible phytoplasma infection. Acknowledgements
