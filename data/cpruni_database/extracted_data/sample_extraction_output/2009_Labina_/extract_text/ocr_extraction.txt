Abstract—The psyllid fauna of the relict steppes of Central Yakutia is studied for the first time. Among the six 
species examined, two are new for Yakutia.

The relict steppes are unique as a type of extrazonal 
vegetation,  widely  distributed  in  the  territory  of  
Yakutia as early as in the Pleistocene. At present, the 
largest pieces of steppe vegetation are preserved in the 
middle stream of  the  Lena  River  and  in  the  basins  of 
the rivers Yana and Indigirka (Ivanova and Perfil’eva, 
1972). 

species  endemic  to  Yakutia,  Psylla  kotejai  Droho-
jowaska et Klimaszewski, 2006 was described. 

Despite  the  fact  that  psyllid  fauna  of  Yakutia  is 
rather  well  studied  as  compared  to  other  Siberian  re-
gions, currently available data are far from being com-
plete,  which  is  particularly  confirmed  by  the  present 
study. 

Psyllids are one of the less studied insects in the Si-
berian fauna: until now, there has been no publication 
on  the  composition  of  the  psyllid  fauna  of  the  region 
as the whole or of its isolated natural areas. The only 
exception  is  the  paper  on  psyllids  of  the  Republic  of 
Altai by Labina (2008). 

Previously,  38  species  of  psyllids  were  recorded 
from  Yakutia  in  different  publications.  The  first  data 
on  psyllids  appeared  in  papers  by  Loginova  (1961, 
1963),  dealing  with  the  revision  of  the  genera 
Aphalara Förster, 1848 and Craspedolepta Enderlein, 
1921 (Loginova, 1961, 1963), in the review on psyllids 
associated  with  Salix  (Loginova,  1967),  and  also  in 
publications where new psyllid species were described 
(Loginova  1962a,  1966).  Several  species  were  re-
corded  from  Yakutia  in  the  faunal  lists  of  other  re-
gions: Leningrad Province (Loginova, 1962b) and the 
Caucasus  (Loginova,  1968).  In  total,  17  species  were 
mentioned  from  Yakutia  by  M.  Loginova,  including  
4 described from the material collected in the territory 
of  the  republic,  with  two  of  them,  Aphalara  sibirica 
Loginova,  1962  and  Cacopsylla  sibirica  (Loginova, 
1966)  being  endemics  to  the  area.  Later  on,  Kli-
maszewski (1983) presented data on 10 psyllid species 
from Yakutia; 9 of them were recorded from this terri-
tory  for  the  first  time.  In  the  later  joint  publication 
(Drohojowaska  and  Klimaszewski,  2006),  one  more 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

The invertebrate fauna of relict steppe communities 
on the bedrock bank of the Lena River was studied in 
the summer of 2007. The present publication is based 
on  material  collected  in  model  plots  by  A.  Bagacha-
nova and Yu. Ermakova, researchers of the Laboratory 
of Systematics and  Ecology  of  Invertebrates,  Institute 
of  Biological  Problems  of  the  Cryolithic  Zone,  Sibe-
rian  Branch,  Russian  Academy  of  Sciences.  Insects 
were  collected  by  sweeping  with  a  standard  entomo-
logical  net;  material  was  kept  in  alcohol.  A  total  of 
126 psyllids was examined. 

Up till now, there were no data on psyllid fauna of 
relict steppes in Central Yakutia. In the present work, 
six  species  belonging  to  the  families  Psyllidae  and 
Triozidae  are  noted,  with  two  of  them,  Bactericera 
curvatinervis (Förster, 1848) and B. rossica (Horváth, 
1901) (Triozidae), not recorded from Yakutia earlier.
