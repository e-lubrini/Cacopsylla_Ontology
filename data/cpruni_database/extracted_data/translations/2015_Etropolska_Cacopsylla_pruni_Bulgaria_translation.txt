Apple proliferation (AP), caused by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’, European stone fruit yellows (ESFY), caused by
‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ and Pear decline (PD) caused by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’ are one of the most
important fruit tree diseases in Europe, but their distribution in Bulgaria is not well known, During 2010 — 2013, the presence
and the spread of the fruit tree phytoplasmas and their vectors were investigated in one of the major fruit tree growing regions
in Bulgaria. All psyllid species described as vectors of fruit tree phytoplasmas were present in the investigated areas. Phyto-
plasma infection in plant and psyllid samples was analyzed by universal and specific PCR. A total of 86 plant samples and
1569 insect samples obtained from I! different sites were tested. As result, all three phytoplasmas were detected in their hosts
and vectors in five different geographical regions of Bulgaria. This is the first report of ‘Ca. P. mali’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in Sofia
region as well as of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in Sofia and Kjustendil regions. This is also the first report of a ‘Ca. P. pyri’ detection in
Cacopsylla bidens which might be a further vector of PD. Key words: ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’,

Introduction

In recent years, phytoplasma diseases have become one
of the most important diseases of fruit trees in Bulgaria but
until now the existence and the spread of fruit tree phytoplas-
mas and their vectors have not been studied in detail. Apple
proliferation (AP) is caused by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
mali’, ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma prunorum’ is the agent of
Apricot chlorotic leafroll mycoplasma (European stone fruit
yellows — ESFY) and ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri’ is the
agent of Pear decline (PD) (Seemiiller and Schneider, 2004;
Jarausch and Jarausch, 2010). Phytoplasmas are cell wall-
less Gram-positive bacteria of the class Mollicutes, and both
their cell and genome size are the smallest among bacteria. Phytoplasmas are restricted to the phloem of infected plants
and are naturally transmitted by phloem-feeding vectors — in

the case of European fruit tree phytoplasmas psyllids of the
family Psyllidae, However, phytoplasmas can also be trans-
mitted through infected propagating material (Bertaccini,
2007). Because of the high risk of phytoplasma spreading
on new territories, the three fruit tree phytoplasmas are still
on the EU and EPPO quarantine lists, and are under spe-
cial regulations (Council Directive 2000/29/EC; EPPO A2
list). In Bulgaria, ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri? have
been first detected near the town of Plovdiv (Topchiiska et
al., 2000; Topchiiska and Sakalieva, 2001, 2002). In 1960,
AP has been reported to occur in Bulgaria by Blattny, Sen
and Blattny Jun, ref. by Trifonov (1972). In 2012, the first
summarized results of the official phytosanitary monitor-
ing program during the period 2007 — 2011 of the Bulgarian
Food Safety Agency (BFSA) were published (Etropolska and
Laginova, 2012). Article Title European Fruit Tree Phytoplasmas in Bulgaria

A few species of the psyllid genus Cacopsylla (Hemiptera:
Psyllidae) have been demonstrated to be vectors of Europe-
an fruit tree phytoplasmas. Two psyllids, Cacopsylla picta
(Foerster) and Cacopsylla melanoneura (Foerster) are recog-
nized vectors of ‘Ca. P. mali’. The psyllid Cacopsylla pruni
Scopoli was described as vector of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ where-
as three psyllid species also of the genus Cacopsylla are rec-
ognized or presumed vectors of ‘Ca. P. pyri’: Cacopsylla pyri
(Linnaeus), C. pyricola (Foerster) and C. pyrisuga (Foerster),
reviewed by Jarausch and Jarausch (2010). All those Cacopsylla species have been described for
Bulgaria by psyllid taxonomists in the 60s of the last cen-
tury (Harizanov, 1966a, 1966b, 1982), long before they have
been identified as phytoplasma vectors. As phytoplasma
vectors, they have never been studied in Bulgaria. In 2011,
we published the first report about PCR detection of ‘Ca. P.
prunorum’ in individuals of their vector Cacopsylla pruni
from two geographically different regions — Sofia and Kjust-
endil districts (Etropolska et al., 201 1a). However, up to the beginning of our work in 2010 al-
most nothing was known about the incidence and the spread
of these quarantine diseases and their vectors in Bulgaria. Therefore, the objective of this study was to elucidate the ac-
tual status of European fruit tree phytoplasma infections in
Bulgaria as well as the presence of the known or putative in-
sect vectors. Materials and Methods

Sampling of plant and insect material
A survey was conducted from the end of August till the
end of October during the period 2010 - 2013 in 11 different
sampling sites with conventional or uncultivated fruit tree or-
chards as well as in nurseries in six different districts in Bul-
garia. The sampling sites are given in Table | and Table 2. Plant material was derived from symptomatic and non-
symptomatic trees from Malus, Prunus and Pyrus spp. in au-
tumn when the concentration of the phytoplasma in the upper
parts of the tree is highest. Insects were caught using sweep-netting during the pe-
riod March-July of each year, Captured psyllids were frozen
at -20°C and psyllid species identification was done using dif-
ferent determination keys (Hodkinson and White, 1979; Os-
siannilsson, 1992; Burckhardt and Jarausch, 2007). In 2013,
some of the species were confirmed by Dr. Daniel Burckhardt
from Naturhistorisches Museum, Basel, Switzerland. Molecular test for phytoplasma infection in
plants and insects

Phloem was prepared from branches of plant samples
and was extracted with a modified CTAB-based protocol as
described by Jarausch et al. (2011). After the morphological
identification, DNA was extracted from single psyllid indi-

viduals with a modified CTAB-based protocol as described
by Jarausch et al. (2011) or by the TNES protocol of Sauvion
(2012). PCR amplification of phytoplasma DNA was achieved
with universal ribosomal primers: fU5/rU4 in the plant sam-
ples (Lorenz et al., 1995) and fUS/rP7 in the insect samples
(Lorenz et al., 1995; Schneider et al., 1995). All positive sam-
ples were tested with the group specific primers fO1/rOl
(Lorenz et al., 1995). For the confirmation of ‘Ca. P. mali’ the
specific primers AP3/AP4 (Jarausch et al., 1994) were used;
for the confirmation of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’, the ESFY-specific
non-ribosomal primers ECA1/ECA2 were applied (Jarausch
et al., 1998) and ‘Ca. P. pyri’ was identified with the specific
primer pair fPD/rPD developed by Etropolska et al. (2011b). Results and Discussion

During the survey period from 2010 to 2013, AP, ESFY
and PD were found in commercial or uncultivated orchards
in five of the most important fruit-growing regions of

Bulgaria: Sofiiski, Blagoevgradski, Plovdivski, Kjustendilski
and Slivenski region. Infected apple trees showed typical
symptoms of AP, like ‘witches’ - broom’ and enlarged stipules
inall fourregions. Typical symptoms of ESFY like preliminary
blooming in late winter, apricot and peach chlorotic leaf
roll, plum leptonecrosis and decline of branches or entire
trees were found in Sofiiski, Kjustendilski and Slivenski
region. Pear trees with small, leathery and up-rolled leaves,
abnormal leaf reddening and premature leaf drop, or decline
of branches and trees were the most common symptoms of
PD in Sofiiski, Kjustendilski and Blagoevgradski region. In
total, 86 plant samples were tested by PCR for the presence
of European fruit tree phytoplasmas. As shown in Table. 1,
phytoplasmas were detected in most of the samples using
universal phytoplasma detection primers. The only exception
was peach which had low infection rates. However, this has
already been reported from Germany where in particular
in peach no good correlation between symptoms and PCR
detection of the phytoplasma was obtained (Jarausch et al.,
2008). Specific identification primers were used to confirm

the presence of ‘Ca. P. mali’ in 24 apple samples, the presence
of ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ in 16 European plum samples and the
identity of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in 14 pear samples. In the surveyed fruit tree orchards all known and puta-
tive psyllid vectors of fruit tree phytoplasmas were identi-
fied: C. pruni, C. picta, C. melanoneura, C. affinis, C. pyri,
C. pyrisuga, C. pyricola and C. bidens, As shown in Table 2,
more than 1500 individuals of the Cacopsylla species were
collected in the different fruit tree orchards and individually
analyzed by PCR for the presence of phytoplasmas. Ina total
of 565 individuals tested, ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ was identified
in 13 specimen of its known vector Cacopsylla pruni. This
represents an infection rate of 2.3% which is in the range of
the infection rates reported from Germany and France, were
annually 2 - 3% of C. pruni were found infected (Jarausch et
al., 2001; Jarausch et al, 2007, 2007b). ‘Ca. P. mali’ was found only in its acknowledged vec-
tor Cacopsylla picta which is considered as main vector
of AP (Jarausch et al., 2011). It was not found in Cacops-
ylla melanoneura which is the most important vector only
in Northwestern Italy (Tedeschi et al., 2002; Tedeschi and
Alma, 2004) but not in Germany (Mayer et al., 2009). C.
melanoneura was found in mixed population with C. picta
on Malus, and also in mixed population with C. affinis on
Crataegus spp. One out of 233 individuals was tested posi-
tive for a phytoplasma which could be identified with spe-
cific primers as ‘Ca. P. pyri’. As PD-infected pear trees were
in the neighborhood of the C. me/anoneura sampling site it
cannot be ruled out that this individual acquired the phyto-
plasma there. So far, it is not known whether C. melanon-
eura can be a vector of ‘Ca. P. pyri’. The only way to proof
this hypothesis is through the method of transmission trials
(Jarausch and Jarausch, 2010). Ina total of 71 individuals of C. picta, two of them were
found infected with ‘Ca. P. mali’. The percentage of infec-
tion is 2.8%, which is very low in comparison with other
regions like Germany and South Tirol where every year the
percent of infection is around 10% (Baric et al., 2010; Ja-
rausch et al., 2011). Ina total of 358 tested individuals of the main vector Ca-
copsylla pyri (Carraro et al., 1998), only one individual was
confirmed to be infected with ‘Ca. P. pyri’, and the percent-
age of infection is 0.28% respectively. Infection with ‘Ca. P. pyri’ was found also in two individuals out of 82 test-
ed of the other main vector Cacopsylla pyricola (Foerster)
(Davies et al., 1992). The percentage of infection is around
2.4%. In comparison, in England this percentage is around
17% (Davies and Eyre, 1996). In addition two other Cacop-
sylla species, Cacopsylla pyrisuga and Cacopsylla bidens,
were found in some of the observed pear orchards (Table

 

2). More than 180 individuals of Cacopsylla pyrisuga were
tested, but no phytoplasma infection was detected. Cacop-
sylla bidens is reported by Burckhardt and Jarausch (2007)
and Jerinié—Prodanovié (2010, 2011) to be present in Bul-
garia and in some neighboring countries, but for Bulgaria
any additional information about the distribution and the
biology of this species is missing. In our study Cacopsylla
bidens was found in three different pear orchards (Table 2). Furthermore, one out of 28 individuals was confirmed to be
infected with ‘Ca. P. pyri’. The calculated infection rate of
3.6% would be the highest for all putative PD vectors in Bul-
garia. To our knowledge, this species has never been tested
for its phytoplasma vectoring capacity. Thus, our result is
the first report of an infection of C. bidens with ‘Ca. P. pyri’. Transmission trials with this species are now needed to con-
clude if C. bidens is a vector of ‘Ca. P. pyri’ in Bulgaria. * Distribution of ‘Ca. P. mali’, the agent of Apple prolifera-
tion, in Bulgaria

AP was found in our survey in the following districts of Bul-
garia: Plovdiv, Kjustendil, Sofia and Blagoevgrad (Figure 1). *
Ca. P. mali’ was confirmed in Veliko Turnovo district as well
(Etropolska and Laginova, 2012). Infected individuals of Ca-
copsylla picta were found in Kjustendil and Sofia districts. This is the first confirmation of ‘Ca. P. mali’ on the territory
of Sofia districts. In total, the results of our survey and from the data of
the official monitoring program of BFSA showed that AP
is spread on the territory of 5 out of all 28 districts in Bul-
garia. ‘Veliko Turnovo ¢

ESFY was found for first time in insect samples collected
in orchards on the territory of Sofia (Gorni Lozen) and Kjus-
tendil (Djakovo village) districts (Etropolska et al., 2011a)
(Figure. 2). In 2012 we confirmed the presence of ESFY in
plant samples on the territory of Sliven district. The pub-
lished data from the official monitoring showed that ESFY
is present also in Burgas, Pazardjik, Dobrich and Yambol
districts (Etropolska and Laginova, 2012). Together with our
results ESFY is confirmed in 7 out of the 28 districts in Bul-
garia. * Distribution of ‘Ca. P. pyri’, the agent of Pear decline,

PD was confirmed in plant samples from Kjustendilski
and Blagoevgradski regions. Infection was confirmed also
in insects from two geographically isolated orchards on the
territory of Sofia district. This is the first report of ‘Ca. P.
pyri’ in Sofia district. Together with the data of BFSA, this phytoplasma is
present on the territory of 8 out of 28 districts of Bulgaria

plasma pyri’ (pear decline) and ‘Ca. Phytoplasma pruno-
rum’ (European stone fruit yellows) are present in Bulgaria. This work is the first report of ‘Ca. P. mali’ and ‘Ca. P. pyri’
in Sofia region. In our survey ‘Ca. P. prunorum’ was found
for the first time in spring of 2011 in Sofia and Kjustendil
regions (Etropolska et al. 01a). Infection was confirmed in
samples from symptomatic and non-symptomatic trees and
also in the psyllid species known as main or putative fruit
tree phytoplasma vectors. From all three phytoplasmas, pear decline is the
most spread phytoplasma disease in Bulgaria. However,
important questions remain open: where is the origin of the
phytoplasma infections or how long do they already exist
on the Bulgarian territory? Which are the main vectors of
the respective phytoplasma diseases in Bulgaria? Molecular
approaches of phytoplasma characterization and specific
transmission trials with candidate vector species are needed
to answer these questions. Acknowledgements
