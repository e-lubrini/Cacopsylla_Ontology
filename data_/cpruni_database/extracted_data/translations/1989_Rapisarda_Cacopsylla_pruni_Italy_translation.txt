SUMMARY

The results are given of a study on the composition of the psyllid fauna of the Adriatic side of the
Carnic and Julian Pre-Alps and Alps and of the adjacent plains. Eightycight psyllid species are recorded in the area under examination, All of them are reported in a
list, which is ordered by families and made up on the basis of bibliographical information, direct collec-
tions on their host plants and captures by trays. Moreover, a few taxonomic notes are given on some
species of little clear systematic interpretation. Zoogeographical information is also given on the species under discussion, determining that the
groups of the widely diffused in the Palaearctic and of the European species are the most represented in
the psyllid fauna of the examined area. Tn the end, a few faunistic notes are reported on the psyllid of the Italian administrative region
Friuli-Venezia Giulia

The knowledge on the jumping plant lice (Psylloidea) of the South-Ea-
stern Alps is rather fragmentary and dispersed in numerous publications,
which concern different subjects. The present note wishes to gather all the available information on the
topic, being it based not only on data from the literature but on both the
direct field collections and captures by yellow water trays. Most of the for-
mers have been carried out by one of us (C.R. ); other samples come from
Prof. L. Masutti (Istituto di Entomologia agraria, Universita di Padova) and
Mr L. Tamanini (Museo civico di Rovereto, TN). The captures by trays have
been realized near Gorizia and Udine, during 1984 and 1985, and the speci-
mens have been sent to us by Mr P.G. Coceano (Centro Regionale per la
Sperimentazione Agraria, Pozzuolo del Friuli, UD). We acknowledge with
many thanks the kind help of the mentioned Authors. DEFINITION OF THE INVESTIGATED AREA

In the present study, the Adriatic side of South-Eastern Alps and Pre-
Alps has been investigated, including the Italian slopes of Carnic Alps and

Pre-Alps, the Julian Alps and Pre-Alps and the Jugoslav territoties of Karst. As to the Carnic Alps, the area under examination is bounded westward by
the basin of the river Piave and the region of Cadore, northward by the Gail
Valley. The latter has not been included in the study, since the river Gail, as
an affluent of the Drava, belongs to the Danubian basin rather than to the
Adriatic one. All the basins of the rivers Livenza, Tagliamento and Isonzo
have also been taken into consideration. LITERARY SURVEY

The first indication of a psyllid for the examined area is not direct and
concerns Trioza rumicis: Massalongo (1881) describes a cecidium on flowers
of Ramex arifolius (now alpestris) nearby Pontebba (province of Udine), sub-
sequently attributed to the action of the mentioned insect. Five years later, Law (1886) describes the new species Floria vicina, col-
lected on Genista radiata (together with F. vittipennella) at Raibl (present
Predil, province of Udine), in Karnten (Carinthia), and indicates the occur-
rence of Trioza alacris at Abbazia (Istria), In a paper on the psyllids of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, Low (1888) lists 42 species whose collection local-
ities lie within the limits of the area here investigated and a great number of
which were collected at Gérz (now Gorizia). Three species were recorded in
the previous work, while the indication of Aphalara calthae cannot be vali-
date as it can be seen in note (2); the remaining 38 species were new for the
zone. In the Catalogue on the fauna of the Reign of Hungary, Horvath (1897)
indicates 19 species of psyllids for the Hungarian «Regio Adriatica» (South-
ern Karst); eleven of them have previously been recorded in the area, the
remaining 8 are new; yet Trioza fraudatrix may be synonymous of a species
already recorded by Léw (1888) (T. marginepunctata). In the Catalogue of Hemiptera of the «coastal land» (Kiistenland), Griffe
(1911) reports 32 species of psyllids, whose determination have been partly
verified by Horvath. Eight of them were not indicated in the region before
and can be added to the 50 species already known by the previous literature
for this area. Prohaska (1927-28) reports 65 species from Karnten and quotes for Raibl
the seven species collected by Prof. F. Then and already reported by Low
(1888). The occurrence in the South-Eastern Alps of some other psyllids has
been occasionally indicated in following papers on different topics. Vondra-
cek (1951) indicates 4 species (all previously recorded in the area) collected
in Monfalcone (province of Gorizia), Flitsch (presently Plezzo or Bovek, in
Jugoslavia) and Trieste. Vondracek (1953) mentions other two species collect-
ed at Flitsch; one of them (Trioza senecionis) is new for the South-Eastern
Alps. Loginova (1975) reports a female of Camarotoscena subrubescens col-
lected at Monfalcone (likely the same specimen already reported by Vondra-

624

cek (1951). Minelli (1977) mentions Psylla fusca, collected at Fusine and
Rutte (province of Udine); yet the species has been already indicated by
Griffe (1911) for Trieste. The records in various localities of the Carnic Alps
of Psylla alpina and Psylla salicett, found on snow, are due to Masutti (1978). The former species is new for the South-Eastern Alps, while the second one
has already been indicated by Léw (1888) for Gorizia, under the name of
Psylla salicicola. Hodkinson (1981) describes the new species Trioza trigonica, with Godia
(near Udine) as the type locality; he also reports, among the type material,
various specimens collected by yellow water trays in other localities of the
province of Udine: Moimacco and Rutte/Tarvisio. Subsequently, Hodkinson
(1983) mentions 36 species of psyllids’ collected with the same method in the
three above said localities and at Udine and Ugovizza(’). Nineteen of these
species have already been indicated for the territory under discussion in the
previous literature; the remaining 17 are new. Among the latter ones, 8 spe-
cies are even new for the Italian fauna (Aphalara calthae, Cacopsylla sorbi,
Trioza pallida, T. schranki, T. tatrensis, Bactericera curvatinervis, B. harrisoni
and B. sp. near striola). In the end, 4 species of psyllids are recorded for this zone by Conci &
Tamanini (1984a), three of which (Aphalara borealis, Cacopsylla brunneipennis
and Trioza rotundata) are new for the area. Conci & Tamanini (1984b) men-
tion the occurrence of Phylloplecta trisignata, yet already evidenced in this
region. In conclusion, 81 species of jumping plant lice are presently known from
the literature for the Adriatic side of the South-Eastern Alps. LIST OF THE SPECIES AND TAXONOMIC NOTES

A complete list is here reported of the psyllids presently known for the
South-Eastern Alps, compiled on the basis of both the above examined
literature (verified under the present taxonomy of the group) and more re-
cent, unpublished data. A total number of 87 species is listed, 6 of which
have not been known till now for this area (Aphalara sauteri, Floria variegata,
Cacopsylla nigrita, C. peregrina, C. pulchra and C. rhododendri). The family division follows the recent classification of the superfamily
Psylloidea, proposed by White & Hodkinson (1985). A presently attributable chorological category is given for each species,
together with the localities within the region under analysis (listed in alpha-
betical order) where they have been found and the Authors who quoted or
collected them in each place. Authors’ and Collector’s names are shortened

()) Hodkinson (1983) uses the same symbol (U) for both Udine and Ugovizza, so that it is impossible
to discern the species collected in each one of the two localities. Therefore, in the list given by us in the
following pages, the species indicated with «U» in this paper are considered as generically collected in
province of Udine

2. NOTES

(1) While listing the present species, LOw (1888) reports its synonymous L. crefeldensis (Mink),
which is now considered a valid species. We have no elements to ascribe Law's specimens to one or to
another of the mentioned species. Therefore, we attribute no chorological category to this taxon

(2) Léw (1888) quotes Aphalara calthae for Raibl (present Predil, UD). In the light of the present

taxonomic knowledge, this indication can be attributed to ev

y species of the polygon’ group and is

therefore omitted. We consider A. calthae as an Eurosibirian element, according to Burckhardt (1983a),
though this geographical distribution should be reviewed, on the basis of the modern taxonomy of the

mentioned group. 632

(3) The Aphalara exilis group needs a taxonomic revision, so that Léw’s (1888) and Hodkinson’s
(1983) quotations are reported as doubtful. For the same reason we attribute no chorological category to
this species. 1a) Likewise for Aphalara exilis, we report no zoogeographical comment for A. polygon, a species
whose geonemy is presently not completely known. (5) The quotations for Raibl and Tolmino are doubtful, since referred to Aphalara picta (auct. nec
Zetterstedt), a species later synonymized partly to Craspedolepta sonchi and to C. flavipennis. We attribute
to the latter species both the Law's (1988) and Griiffe’s (1911) quotations, since its occurrence in the

~ South-Eastern Alps is evidenced by the sample from Udine and owing to the lack of the former species in
the Italian fauna. (6) Species in need of taxonomic revision. (7) Arytaina montana Cet. has been recently synonymized to the present species (Burckhardt,
1983b). (8) Burckhardt (1983b) has recently synonymized Floria lineata Cer. to the species under analysis. (9) Dimorphic species, with smoky forewinged populations and transparent winged ones. Before
being synonymized (though still in a controversial way), these forms have been considered as two distinct
species, respectively brunneipennis Edw. and klapaleki Sule. The localities previously referred to both the
species” are therefore considered, t0 study the geographical distribution of the present one. (10) The only quotation for the Italian fauna. (11) We consider this species as an European element, rather than a Holopalaearctic one, for the
uncertainty of its presence in Japan, probably to be referred to a different taxon, and for its total absence
all over the Asiatic Continent. (12) Species not quoted up to now for the Italian fauna. (13) The pyricola Férster group has been recently revised by Burckhardt & Hodkinson (1986) and
three species occur in Italy, previously ascribed to the only Cacopsyila pyricola. Therefore we generically
attribute the findings of the South-Eastern Alps to the «species group», besides giving no zoogeographical
comment. (14) All the records of H. ficus preceding the description of H. viridis (Klimaszewski, 1961) can
indifferently be referred to one of the two species and are therefore reported by us as «species group»,
since the present knowledge on the distribution of the Fig psyllids in Italy (Tamanini, 1966) makes us
think that they both occur in the South-Eastern Alps

(15) The Italian material of Trioza apicalis should be re-examined in the light of the recent Burck-
harde’s revision (1986). According to the host plants and geographical distributions of the presently
known species of this group, we yet ascribe to T. apicalis (sensu stricto) the findings of the South-Eastern

ps. (16) Léw’s quotations (1888) for Gorizia and Raibl are given for T. viridula (auct. nec Zetterstedt)
but they are probably to be referred to apicalis. (17) A probable synonymous of T. marginepunctata Flor, to which we therefore assign no chorolog-
ical category. (18) In the mentioned revision of the T. apicalis Férster group, Burckhardt (1986) suggests to assign
the new name T. anthrisci to the species under examination. (19) Griiffes’s (1911) quotation regards T. saundersi M.-D., a synonymous of B. acutipennis (Zett. ),
and is the only record of this species for the Tialian fauna. The report is probably erroneous,

(20) Law's records of Trioza acutipennis (auct. nec Zetterstedt) for Raibl and the Forest of Tamova
probably regard Bactericera femoralis (Forster). (21) Species not quoted up to now for the Italian fauna. The findings of this species for the Nearctic
Region need a confirm,

(23) Some records of B. nigricornis preceding the description of B. trigonica (Hodkinson, 1981) could
regard the latter species. (24) The geonemy of this species needs to be revised; therefore we give no zoogeographical com-
ment. (25) This species needs a taxonomical definition and is not included by us in the following zoogeo-
graphical considerations. ZOOGEOGRAPHICAL CONSIDERATION

__ A detailed zoogeographical analysys on the psyllids of South-Eastern Alps
is not easy, owing both to the little direct investigations which have been

633

carried out till now on the psyllid fauna of this area and to a deficient geo-
nemical knowledge presently available on a large number of species. With regard to the latter aspect, very little is known on the psyllids of the
Iberian peninsula and North Africa; as to the palaearctic Asia, besides a
good knowledge for some zones of USSR (especially Caucasus) and Mongo-
lia, nearly nothing is known of the Chinese region, while numerous indica-
tions regarding Japan need a taxonomical confirm. In spite of that, in the following pages we shall try to single out the most
representative chorological elements among the psyllid fauna of South-Ea-
stern Alps. To this end, the geographical distribution of each species has
been defined (as far as possible) in the light of La Greca’s (1964) consid-
erations on the chorological categories of the Italian faunistic elements. Livia limbata, Aphalara exilis, A. polygoni, Cacopsylla sp. gr. pyricola,
Trioza fraudatrix, Bactericera striola and B. sp. near striola have not been
taken into consideration in the present study, for the previously said reasons. The remaining 80 species can be divided into the following five chorological

groups. 1. Species widely diffused in the Palaearctic Region

It is the most represented group, to which 35 species (the 43.75% out of
the total) can be ascribed

We consider as holopalaearctic a complex of 13 species, though the oc-
currence in North Africa of some of them (even widely distributed from
Europe to Japan) has not been indicated up to now, probably owing to the
mentioned scarcity of data concerning this area. Among these holopalaearctic
species, Cacopsylla mali and C. rhododendri are worth of mention. The for-
mer, trophically related to a plant of primary economic importance, has been
accidentally introduced into North America and Australia; the latter one
shows an almost discontinuous distribution within the Palaearctic Region,
having it been recorded only for Central Europe, Siberia and Japan. Its even
slight orophylous trend and the peculiar distribution of its host plants could
be the reasons of the discontinuous geonemy of this species. Euroasiatic elements can undoubtly be considered Aphalara borealis, Trio-
za apicalis and Bactericera albiventris. The two pear psyllids, Cacopsylla pyri
and C. pyrisuga, can be ascribed to the mentioned group, too; though their
occurrence in Asia presently regards only the Eastern but not the Central
side of the Continent. In the end, among the Euroasiatic species the orophy-
lous Aphalara longicaudata is worth of mention, whose distribution in Europe
is limited to the central-eastern regions. Among the Eurosibirian species (totally four), Craspedolepta flavipennis
does not occur in the well investigated Scandinavian territories, while Trioza
pallida can be found only in the central-eastern part of Europe. An Euromiddleasiatic geonemy is shown by a complex of twelve species,
three of which (Psyllopsis fraxinicola, Cacopsylla crataegi and Bactericera perri-

634

si) are variously diffused in the Mediterranean Region, too. Among the re-
maining 9 species, Psyllopsis fraxini has been introduced into North America
(such as P. fraxinicola), while the distribution in Europe of Bactericera mo-
desta is bounded to the oriental regions of the central southern part. 2. European species

It is another widely represented group within the psyllid fauna of the
South-Eastern Alps, of the same consistence as the previous one. First of all, the holoeuropean elements (a total of nine species) belong to
this group, of which the orophylous Cacopsylla albipes and C. sorbi are worth
of mention, together with C. pulcbra, which has been repeatedly recorded for
Japan but whose occurrence has been indicated for no other region of the
Asiatic Continent. Besides the mentioned species, diffused all over Europe, other psyllids
can be listed which populate only partially the Continent. Psylla alpina, P.
fusca, Cacopsylla nigrita and Trioza rotundata do not occur in Western Eu-
rope, while Floria variegata, Trioza schranki, T. senecionis, T. tatrensis and
Bactericera harrisoni mainly populate the central part of Europe. Among the
CS-European species, Cacopsylla intermedia and Trioza rumicis occur only in
the eastern regions; C. parvipennis show a similar trend not to spread west-
wards, though populating the north-central part of Europe. Floria spectabilis
and Baeopelma colorata can be generically defined as South European spe-
cies; more exactly, the former is a SW-European transAdriatic element, while
the latter is a SE-European one. Among the Euromediterranean species, Asphagidella buxi and Lauritrioxa
alacris are worth mentioning, both introduced into America and the former
also into Hawaii. In the end, a peculiar geographical distribution is shown by some other
species, such as Psyllopsis meliphila (Euro-Maghrebine), Camarotoscena sub-
rubescens and Floria horvathi (Euro-Anatolian) and Cacopsylla suturalis (Pon-
to-Illirian). 3. Mediterranean species

Though including a complex of 6 species, which represent the 7.5% out
of the total, this chorological group has a limited importance within the psyl-
lid fauna of South-Eastern Alps. Infact all the species ascribed to it, except
Bactericera trigonica (whose geographical distribution is not yet entirely
known), have been recorded in the coastal band of the territory under exam-
ination, which is therefore only marginally affected by the occurrence of
these species. Besides the typical Mediterranean psyllids (such as Euphyllura olivina and
Trioza marginepunctata), Euphyllura phillyreae, Homotoma ficus and Bacteri-
cera crithmi are worth mentioning, which are variously spread through the

635

Pontic area, too; the latter species extends itself also along the Atlantic coast,
as far as Great Britain. As to B. trigonica, we only temporarily consider this
species as a Mediterraneo-Iranian element. 4. Alpine species

Only three species among the listed psyllids belong to this chorological
group; they are Aphalara sauteri, Floria vicina and F. vittipennella, the latter
two both feeding on Genista radiata. Yet, more accurate faunistic researches
carried out in the territory under examination could probably allow us to
find other species of such group,

5. Species widely diffused also out of the Palaearctic Region

We can mention only Psylla alni, which is widespread all over the Pa-
Jaearctic Region and in North America. CONCLUSIONS

The results of the present analysis are graphically exposed in Fig. 1; there
the predominance, within the psyllid fauna of South-Eastern Alps, of Pa-
laearctic and European species easily emerges. On the contrary, the group of
alpine endemisms is scarcely represented. However, besides the three psyllids
listed by us in the latter group, nine other species of a wider geographical
distribution exclusively populate the mountainous environments. Therefore, a
total of 12 orophylous species is presently known for the South Eastern Alps,
which represent the 15% out of the local psyllid fauna. The zoogeographical considerations made in this work have, of course, a
provisional value, and even big changes can derive from a more accurate
faunistic study in the area and also a more detailed knowledge of the geo-
graphical distribution of the species here collected. In the end it is worth to point out that only 79 species among the listed
psyllids occur in the Italian region Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Infact Euphyllura
phillyreae, Cacopsylla parvipennis, C. suturalis, Trioza fraudatrix, T. margine-
punctata, T. senecionis, Bactericera maura and Phylloplecta trisignata have
been recorded only in presently Jugoslav localities of the South-Eastern Alps. In particular, 4 out of these 8 species (C. parvipennis C. suturalis, T. frau-
datrix and B. maura) have not been quoted till now for the whole Italian
fauna. Conversely, 3 out of the mentioned 79 species (Cacopsylla intermedia,
Trioza dispar(?) and Bactericera acutipennis) presently occur in Italy only in
the region under discussion. As to the published data, Friuli-Venezia Giulia
has therefore the largest psyllid fauna, among the Italian regions; while tak-

FIG. 1 - Chorological division of the psyllid fauna of South-Eastern Alps. ing into consideration also the unpublished data at our disposal, it is the
second one, largely below the 100 species of the region Trentino. APPENDIX

Since going to press, other information on the psyllid fauna of South-
Eastern Alps has been found in Nowak P. & W. Wagner, 1962 - Beitrag zur

637

Kenntnis der Homopteren-fauna Dalmatiens - God. biol. Inst. Univ. Sarajevo,
15: 31-53. Three species of psyllids are quoted for Susak in this work: Ago-
noscena cisti (Puton), Euphyllura phillyreae Forster and Cacopsylla pyrisuga
(Férster). The latter two species have been already considered by us in the
present paper. As to «Agonoscena cisti», it was not examined in the previous
pages and represents the 88th species in the psyllid fauna of South Eastern
Alps. Owing to the rather complicated taxonomic history of the complex A.
cisti-A. targionit, it is not possible to ascribe the Nowak & Wagner’s quota-
tion to one of the two species. Thus no zoogeographical comment is given. LITERATURE
