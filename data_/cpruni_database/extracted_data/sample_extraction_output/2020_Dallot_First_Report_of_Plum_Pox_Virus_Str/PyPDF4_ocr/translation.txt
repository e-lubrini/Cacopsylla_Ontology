Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia Sharka, caused by plum pox virus (PPV, genus Potyvirus ), is one of the most important Prunus diseases ( Scholthof et al. 2011 ). Its worldwide presence includes almost all Eastern and Central European countries ( Rimbaud et al. 2015 ). 1 € 2 1 2 1 1 2 brought to you by CIRAD Dist !"#!"#$!$!%!"&'!

"H#2=@8K!LKG"K!HM'K2=E Surprisingly, there is still no o ! cial report of PPV presence in the Republic of North Macedonia (previously: former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), despite the mention of sharka on plum trees in old ( Josifovi ! 1964 ) and local ( Mitrev et al. 2012 ) documents and its o ! cial presence in the surrounding countries (i.e., Albania, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece [ EPPO 2019 ]). In June 2018, we carried out a countrywide survey targeting cultivated (commercial orchards and private gardens), subspontaneous, and wild Prunus trees, including P. persica , P. armeniaca , P. domestica, and P. cerasifera . Leaf samples were collected from 173 trees exhibiting typical (chlorotic rings and vein yellowing; 115 samples), atypical (necrotic spots; 29), or no (29) sharka symptoms. In the absence of typical symptoms, PPV detection was performed by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Agdia, Elkhart, IN) followed, for all positive samples, by immunocapture reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) with the PPVpolyvalent P10/P20 primers ( Olmos et al. 2002 ). The samples with typical sharka symptoms were directly subjected to ICRT-PCR. Strains were typed using strain-speci " c primers (CIPM/MR and CIP-D/DR, in combination with P3M/P4 and P3D/P4), allowing the ampli " cation of either PPV-M or PPV-D genomic fragments in the (Cter)P3-6K1-(Nter)CI and (Cter)NIb(Nter)CP regions, respectively ( Candresse et al. 1998 ; Kamenova et al. 2011 ). Successful PCR ampli " cations with CIP-D/DR and P3M/P4 primer pairs suggested the presence of recombinant PPV-Rec. The mD5/mM3 primers spanning the PPV-Rec recombination breakpoint ( " ubr et al. 2004 ) were used in a second step to identify PPV-Rec isolates and mixedstrain infections. PPV was detected in 69% of the samples (110, 8, and 1 samples with typical, atypical, and no sharka symptoms, respectively), among which 88 were typed as PPVM (74%), 10 as PPV-D (8%), and 21 as PPV-Rec (18%).

"H#2=@8K!LKG"K!HM'K2=E infection (M+D) was detected in only one sample. To con " rm the strain typing, the genomic region consisting of the (Cter)NIb, full CP, and 3ÕUTR (1,252 nt) was sequenced for nine isolates typed as PPV-M (MK41, MK112, and MK175), -D (MK52, MK61, and MK169), and -Rec (MK121, MK137, and MK158). Each sequence was assembled from two overlapping PCR fragments ampli " ed (and directly sequenced) using primer pairs P3M or P3D/P1, and P2 ( Wetzel et al. 1991 )/PolyT9 (5 ! -T GTCTCTTGC-3 ! ), respectively. The Macedonian isolates typed as PPV-M, -Rec, and -D showed the highest nucleotide identities with PPV-M (98.7 to 99.3% with either M92280 or AJ243957), PPV-Rec (99.3 to 99.4% with HG964685), and PPV-D (98.2 to 99% with either HQ452356 or LT600780) strains, respectively. Phylogenetic reconstruction con " rmed (with high support values) strain assignment. The corresponding sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MK562730 to MK562738). This is the " rst o ! cial report of PPV in the Republic of North Macedonia, where all sampled peach and plum orchards were infected. This work bridges a knowledge gap in the distribution of this quarantine pathogen, which induces up to 100% yield loss for the most susceptible local plum cultivars (e.g., Po " ega # a) ( Scholthof et al. 2011 ).
