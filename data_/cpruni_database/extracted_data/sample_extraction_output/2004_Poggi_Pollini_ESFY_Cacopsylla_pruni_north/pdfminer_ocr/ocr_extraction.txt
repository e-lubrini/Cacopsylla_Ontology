Abstract 

European  stone  fruit  yellows  (ESFY)  has  been  reported  in  Italy  with 
increasing frequency in peach orchards in the provinces of Forlì-Cesena, Ravenna, 
Rimini and Verona. The discovery of the natural vector of ESFY phytoplasma, the 
psyllid Cacopsylla pruni, prompted us to investigate the presence of psyllids infected 
by  ESFYP,  as  well  as  other  potential  vectors  and  alternative  hosts,  in  various 
orchards  in  these  provinces.  The  molecular  diagnostic  method  used  (PCR-ELISA) 
made  it  possible  to  detect  several  C.  pruni  psyllids  infected by ESFYP in this area, 
but  no  important  secondary  vectors  were  found  in  the  peach  orchards.  Molecular 
tests  were  also  made  on  wild  plants  surrounding  the  orchards,  leading  to  ESFYP 
identification in wild Prunus alone.  

INTRODUCTION 

In  Europe,  several  syndromes  caused  by  European  Stone  Fruit  Yellow 
Phytoplasma (ESFYP), a member of the Apple Proliferation (AP) group (Lee et al, 1998; 
Seemüller et al., 1998) have been described in stone fruit species. This pathogen can be 
spread naturally by the psyllid Cacopsylla pruni Scopoli (Carraro et al., 2001). 

Prior to  1995,  ESFYP  was only sporadically reported in peach tree orchards, but 
recent  studies  have  indicated  a  spreading  of  this  syndrome  in  Northern  Italy.  In  the 
orchards  inspected,  1-4%  of  trees  were  affected,  most of  which  grafted  on  cv.  G.F.  677 
(Poggi Pollini et al., 2001a). 

This  article  reports  further  investigation  of  ESFYP  epidemiology  to  evaluate  the 

possible existence of alternative hosts or other potential vectors. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

In  the  two  year  period  2000-2002,  to  obtain  greater  information  about  the 
spreading  of  ESFYP  in  peach  orchards,  leafhoppers  and  psyllids  were  captured  in  the 
Forlì-Cesena,  Ravenna,  Rimini  and  Verona  provinces.  The  insects  were  captured  using 
the  “frappage”  method  or  chromotropic  traps  placed  on  cultivated  and  wild  stone  fruit 
trees (Table 1), and, during the winter, on conifers and other wild plants surrounding the 
areas where an increase had been noted in the disease in recent years (Table 2). 

Tests  were  also  made  on  other  wild  rosaceous  plants  (Prunus  cerasifera,  P. 
mahaleb, P. spinosa, Rosa canina, Rubus fruticosus), generally asymptomatic or showing 
off-season growth in winter, in the vicinity of the affected orchards. Several common wild 
plants  (Celtis  australis,  Cornus  sanguinea,  Corylus  avellana,  Cupressus  leylandii,

Fraxinus  excelsior,  Laurus  nobilis)  were  also  analysed  for  the  presence  of  ESFYP  or 
other phytoplasmas. Previous reports indicated that some were ESFYP-hosts (Jarausch et 
al., 2001a). Out of 20 C. australis trees, 8 showed leaf chlorosis and 8 leaf roll. All the C. 
sanguinea shrubs exhibited leaf reddening; the other species were symptomless. 

Total DNA was extracted from groups of insects (2-5), after classification, or from 
individual  plants  according  to  a  phytoplasma  enrichment  procedure  (Marzachì  et  al., 
1999).  ESFYP  was  identified  with  immunoenzymatic  detection  of  PCR  products  (PCR-
ELISA), using primer pair fOI/rOI and an ESFYP-specific probe as described previously 
(Poggi  Pollini  et  al.,  2001a).  PCR  products,  initially amplified with  universal  ribosomal 
primer pair R16F2/R2, were diluted to 1:40 and 2 µl aliquots were used as templates in 
nested-PCR reactions primed by one of the group-specific primer pairs (I, III, V, X) (Lee 
et al., 1995) to evaluate the presence of other phytoplasmas alone or in association with 
ESFYP. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

The  results  obtained  showed  that  numerous  groups  of  C.  pruni,  captured  in  all 
provinces  on  different  stone  fruit  trees  (P.  cerasifera,  P.  persica  and  P.  spinosa)  were 
infected  by  ESFYP.  Other  psyllids,  one  from  each  group  of  Bactericera  curvatinervis, 
Laurotrioza alacris and Trioza urticae, were also found to be infected by ESFYP. In the 
winter traps placed on conifers, only one group of C. pyrisuga (Forster), captured on C. 
leylandii in the Verona province in 2002, was positive for ESFYP. 

Out  of  the  numerous  leafhoppers  tested,  there  were  only  two  positive  groups  of  
Macrosteles cristatus (Ribaut), collected from peach trees in the summer of 2000 in the 
Verona province (Table 3). Further tests on these leafhoppers in subsequent years did not 
however  confirm  these  results.  The  occasional  finding  of  ESFYP  in  leafhoppers  has 
already been reported (Jarausch et al., 2001b). 

The results obtained indicate that PCR-ELISA is reliable and can also be used for 
specific  detection  of  ESFYP  in  insects,  as  previously  demonstrated  for  AP  and  pear 
decline (PD) phytoplasmas in its vectors. Furthermore, it offers a greater sensitivity than 
gel  electrophoresis  (Poggi  Pollini  et  al.,  2001b).  No  phytoplasmas  belonging  to  other 
groups  (I,  III,  V)  or  other  phytoplasmas  of  the  same AP-group  (X)  were  detected  in  the 
insects examined. 

As  regards  the  wild  plants  examined,  various  P.  cerasifera  and  P.  spinosa  trees 
and  occasionally  other  wild  Prunus  were  found  to  be  infected,  although  most  were 
asymptomatic.  The  largest  number  of  infected  psyllids  were  captured  precisely  on  these 
trees (Table 4 and 5). No phytoplasmas were found, even using nested-PCR, in the other 
plants with suspicious phytoplasma symptoms or in symptomless plants.  

It  can  be  concluded  that  individual  infected  C.  pruni  were  present  in  the  peach 
orchards of all the provinces examined. At present the intensive testing of insects suggests 
there  is  no  important  secondary  vector  of  ESFYP  in  peach  orchards  in  Northern  Italy; 
however the role of other psyllids in ESFYP transmission will be evaluated. 

As regards the wild plants surrounding the peach orchards, only wild Prunus were 
found to be infected by ESFYP.  The possible role of additional plant hosts in the spread 
of the disease, as suggested in France (Jarausch et al, 2001a), was not confirmed by our 
research, since all the methods used failed to detect ESFYP in these species.  

Wild Prunus around the peach orchards certainly play a role in the epidemiology 
of  the  disease.  As  already  indicated  in  the  past,  they  represent  good  hosts  for  ESFYP, 
without showing symptoms, as well as for the insect vector (Carraro et al., 2001; Jarausch 
et al., 2001b). This indicates the importance of including these plants in a control program 
to eliminate the vector psyllid.
