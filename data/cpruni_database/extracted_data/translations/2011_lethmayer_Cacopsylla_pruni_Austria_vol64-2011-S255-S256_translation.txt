Abstract

To study the occurrence and distribution of psyllids as potential vectors of European stone fruit yellows (ESFY), pear decline
(PD) and apple proliferation (AP) a survey was conducted in Austrian orchards during the last years. Specimens were collected by
using the beating tray method in apricot, pear and apple tree orchards. The obtained psyllids were analysed by PCR and RFLP
assays for the presence of phytoplasmas. Molecular analyses showed few infections of Cacopsylla pruni with ‘Candidatus Phyto-
plasma prunorum’ and few individuals of Cacopsylla pyricola, C. pyri and C. pyrisuga were carrier of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma

pyri’. The data presented in this study are a preliminary report beca

 

se analyses of apple psyllids are still in progress. Key words: Cacopsylla spp., European stone fruit yellows, pear decline, apple proliferation

Introduction

European stone fruit yellows (ESFY), pear decline (PD)
and apple proliferation (AP) are quarantine diseases as-
sociated with phytoplasmas (‘Candidatus Phytoplasma
prunorum’, ‘Ca. P. pyri’ and 'Ca. P. mali'), which are re-
sponsible for great economic losses in fruit production
(Seemiiller and Schneider, 2004). The spread of these
phytoplasmas is due to infected planting material or in-
sect vectors, especially psyllids (Hemiptera Psyllidae). The occurrence of these diseases has been described in
Austria by Richter (1999), Spornberger ef al. (2006),
Steffek and Altenburger (2008). A literature review re-
vealed a lack of data on potential vectors in Austria. The
aim of this study was to gain more information on the
occurrence of these potential vectors and the phyto-
plasma infection status of psyllids from pome and stone
fruit trees in Austria. Materials and methods

Investigation sites were located in the Eastern part of
Austria - 10 apricot orchards in Lower Austria, Bur-
genland and Vienna, 5 pear orchards and 3 apple or-
chards in Lower Austria. Samples were collected by us-
ing the beating tray method with 100 beats respectively
100 branches (trees) per sampling date and orchard. Psyllid captures were done in the period from March to
July, on apricot trees in 2005 and 2006, on pear and ap-
ple trees in 2009 and 2010. Collected psyllids were
identified according to Ossiannilsson (1992) and Burck-
hardt and Jarausch (2007). Molecular analyses for phytoplasma infection of psyl-
lids were carried out with 1 to 8 individuals per sample
taken for testing: CTAB-method for the DNA-extraction
of psyllids (Maixner et al., 1995), qualitative PCR for
the detection of phytoplasmas in the psyllid samples us-
ing universal primers fU5/rU3 (Lorenz et al., 1995) and
then for nested PCR using phytoplasma specific primer
pairs P1/P7 primer (Deng and Hiruki, 1991; Schneider

et al., 1995) and f01/r01 primer (Lorenz et al., 1995)
respectively. RFLP assays using restriction enzymes
Sspl and Rsal were applied to discriminate among the
three fruit tree phytoplasmas AP, PD and ESFY
(Tedeschi et al., 2009). Results

The plum psyllid Cacopsylla pruni was found in all in-
vestigated apricot orchards. The first report of C. pruni
on apricot trees in Austria was mentioned in Lethmayer
and Hausdorf (2005). Interesting was the high number
of Cacopsylla melanoneura on apricot trees at some
investigation sites which was due to hawthorn hedges
near the apricot orchards. The three pear psyllid species
Cacopsylla pyricola, Cacopsylla pyri, Cacopsylla

pyrisuga and the hawthorn psyllid C. melanoneura

were the main species on pear trees. C. pyricola was
the most abundant species. On apple trees the psyllids
C. melanoneura and Cacopsylla picta were mainly cap-
tured. Molecular analyses of C. pruni showed five positive
samples (with 30 individuals in total) out of 37 tested
samples (with 142 individuals in total) with 'Ca. P.
prunorum'. These samples originated from four sites in
Lower Austria. All individual of C. melanoneura
caought on the apricot and pear trees tested negative for
phytoplasmas. All three pear psyllid species, C. pyri-
cola, C. pyri and C. pyrisuga, were found infected with
Ca. P. pyri’ comprising 16 positive samples (with 48
individuals in total) out of 33 tested samples (with 118
individuals in total). Positive samples were obtained at
three pear sites in Lower Austria. First analyses showed
that the all psyllids collected on apple were infected
with 'Ca. P. mali’. An overview of the molecular analy-
ses is given in table 1. Other studies have already confirmed that the psyllid
species which were tested positive in our study are vec-
tors of the respective phytoplasmas (rewieved by
Jarausch and Jarausch, 2010). Working Group 2 - Epidemiology and vector ecology

C. pyrisuga has been found infected with ‘Ca. P. pyri’
(Kucerova et al., 2007) but its ability of transmission is
still not verified (Jarausch and Jarausch, 2010). Due to
the geographical position of Austria it is interesting which
of the two psyllid species found on apple can be identify-
ind as main vector for transmission of AP in Austria. First
investigations did not indicate a particular vector capacity
for ‘Ca. P. mali’ by C. melanoneura or C. picta '. How-
ever, due to the low number of investigated apple psyllids
further analyses are necessary to clarify the vector role
and therefore this issue is still in progress. Discussion

One of the main phytosanitary measures for preventing
phytoplasma diseases spread is the control of their vec-
tors. The use of insecticides in sustainable production
methods is restricted. Therefore, knowledge on the vec-
tors (mainly psyllids), their distribution and biology is
strongly needed for control strategies, especially for
new approaches on integrated control strategies. Acknowledgements

We are very grateful to all growers who made their or-
chards available to us for carrying out the investigations
and to Christoph J. Mayer for advice in psyllids identifi-
cation. The present work has been carried out in the
frame of COST action FA0807 “Integrated Management
of Phytoplasma Epidemics in Different Crop Systems”. References
