The original diseases of phytoplasma are causing more and more serious problems for growers around the world. In the latter year, the
the destruction of phytoplasma caused by phytoplasma poses a serious threat to crop production by reducing the yield of the crop,
with a serious loss of yield, with the destruction of the life of the tree, its destruction. Apricot phytoplasmic disease ("Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum ”

Known in Eurdpa in 1924-6, The disease was diagnosed in 1992 in Hungary. The apricot is apricot in shell

Plant diseases caused by phytoplasmas have increased importance in all over the world for fruit growers. Lately, phytoplasma diseases
occur on many fruit varieties and responsible for serious losses both in quality and quantity of fruit production. In the long-run these
diseases cause destruction of fruit trees. The apricot phytoplasma disease (Ca. Phytoplasma prunorum) was first reported in Europe in 1924
from France. In 1992 the disease has also been identified in Hungary. On the base of growers ’signals serious damages of‘ Candidatus
Phytoplasma prunorum ”Seemiiller and Schneider, 2004 (formerly: European stone fruit yellows phytoplasma) could be observed in different
stone fruit plantations in the famous apricot-growing area nearby Géne town, Northern-Hungary. Field examinations have been begun in
2009 in several stone fruit plantations in Borsod-Abatij-Zemplén County mainly in Gane region which is one of the most important apricot
growing regions in Hungary, named “Géné Apricot Growing Area”. Our goals were to diagnose the occurrence of Ca. Phytoplasma
Prunorum on stone fruits (especially on apricot) in the North-Hungarian growing areas by visual diagnostics and confirm data by laboratory
PCR-based examinations, All the 28 samples collected were tested in laboratory trials and at 13 samples from apricot, peach, sour cherry
and wild plum were confirmed the presence of phytoplasma (ESFY). On the base of observations it seems evident that the notable losses

peach patterns. CONCLUSIONS

It can be stated that in the examined areas of Borsod-Abatj-Zemplén county the European
sargasig (European Stone Fruit Yellows, ESFY) phytoplasma infection ("Ca. Phytoplasma
orum "), causing heavy arms. Laboratory samples were collected from four plantations for laboratory tests
‘Ira. Based on the results, it is certain that the applicant6 is present in all four plantations examined by us
There are a total of 28 samples from specimens showing signs of phytoplasma.
and from the Bekecs and Biikkaranyos area, the largest, 16 apricots. Our samples are 13-bdl successful
confirmed to detect phytoplasm. However, the PCR test showed negative results
phytoplasma infection cannot be ruled out with certainty. The nuts, mainly cherries
may contain gatld substances that affect the molecular detectability of the reactant
effectiveness. There have been no previous examinations in this area Take examinations for phytoplasma infection
to cure it. The research group of the Institute for the Protection of Anthrax of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences completed 1995 and 2000 hands
examinations all over the country, but only in the north-western part of Hungary for infection with ESFY]
they report. In North-Eastern Hungary, apricots, wild plums, peaches and cherries "Ca. Phytoplasma
prunorum "has not previously been described. LITERATURE
