Capture of leaf fleas (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) from
Swedish Malaise trap project - new provincial finds and
rare species occurring in Sweden

Gertsson, C-A. : Catch of leaf fleas (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) in Malaise rags - new
provincial finds and visually occurring species in Sweden. [Collecting of jumping plant-
lice (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) from the Swedish Malaise Trapping Project - new prov-
ince-records and rare species in Sweden.] ~ Entomologisk Tidskrift 131 (1): 55-65. Up-
psala, Sweden 2010. ISSN 0013-886x. This paper presents the material of jumping plant-lice (psyllids) caught in 69 Malaise traps
distributed over Sweden. In addition, recently determined material from entomological
museums across Sweden is reported. The Malaise trap material consisted of over 4000
specimen, belonging to 52 species, which is 57% of the species known from Sweden, No
new species for the country was encountered, but 82 new province records. Cacopsylla
pulchra (Zetterstedt, 1838), Trioza uticae (Linné, 1758) and C. melanoneura (Foerster,
1848) were the most frequent species. 12 of the species were caught in winter (November
to March) and 75% of these hibernate on conifers. Carl-Axel Gertsson, Murareviigen 13, SE-227 30 Lund, Sweden. Email: carl-axel.gerts-

to collect insects from all over the country in Malaisefillor. The intention is above all to gain a better knowledge
about badly cheeked insect groups, frimst fry
and twins (mosquitoes and flies). More than 80%
of the catches consist of species from these insect
groups (Karlsson et al. 2005). In this article

It is black to decide whether the 6 species, which
mentioned above from the malaisefill material,
and who was only patriarched in a fatal landscape dr
silly or not in our country. No star insam-
leaf flea activity does not occur
mit. However, some species are mentioned in the literature
as sparingly available. C. crataegi an-
given by Ossiannilssson (1971) as one of commodity
herringbone species. Hodkinson & White (1979)
it also occupies as unusual in England. Species
described as writing, which may explain
its small spread in each country. Probably you
it with us on the border to its northern distribution
area. Likasé omniimner Hodkinson &
White (1979) C. rhamnicola, Trioza flavipennis
and T. munda as unusual species in England. 7.
flavipennis (cherry leaf flea), found only in
Sk, S6 and Up, are probably more common than what
as stated by Ossiannilsson (1992). C. rham-
nicola is mentioned in the norwegian rédlistan,
VU (Odegaard et al. 2006). 7. munda has only

national studies show that leaf fleas have a large
stomach to spread Lingt from its virgin plants. This takes place in a certain mine with its own power, but
above all it is the wind that keeps the animals long
knits. English studies have shown that
the species C. melanoneura, B. albiventris and T.
urticae can be pitriiffas pA barrtriid lying on
more currently 10 km away from the outermost crops (Hod-
kinson 2009). During examinations in Sweden
of T. apicalis, the carrot leaf flea, showed that a

this investigation was attempted to diver out

they fly actively. One jimférde in which direction

could not be found, however. A closer study of species found from November
until March was done to investigate the species distribution
gene during migration and winter time (Tab. 2). The time between November and March was chosen. IN
a Norwegian study showed that migrants
the operation was completed in November. During March
month, the number of leaf fleas decreased very sharply
pa barrtriiden. It was examined with jimna mel-
lanrum during this period the species distribution of
i.a. leaf fleas in spruce (Picea abies). The studies
carried out in the Oslo area (Hagvar & Hagvar
1975). [this survey collected 19 different
arter. T. urticae, C. brunneipennis and B. cur-
vatinervis were those who patriiffades in the greatest mingd. In the Swedish material was C. melanoneura, C.

however, not fully compared. The collections in Norway
was limited to one area, while the Swedish
the collections covered the whole of sédra Sweden. In-
the collection methodology also varied & between
derna. In Norway, branches of spruce were collected with
at regular intervals. A species that shows great reality
ar P. alni, albladloppan (Tab. 1 & 2). This is
an miirkningsvart as the species is completely bound to
sticky and grail. The species 6winters in the agg stage

The animals move between different trees and
then a certain wind spread can occur. Under it
time when the plants have a foliage is known
that some species move to from dildo leaves
to younger newcomers (Hodkinson 2009). As

2009, C. melanoneura (Ha 19.11-8.12 2004), C.
pulchra (Ol 3.1-1.2 2005), C. pyricola (Ol 3.1-

2006) and T. apicalis (Fri 3.11 2005-3.1 2006). These species were caught in the rags during the
drag time periods. Has, however, shown that leaf fleas
has a mobility éiven during the cold season. This has been shown with great clarity in the
a Norwegian survey. Hagvar (2007) has
in over 40 years studied the occurrence of i.a. leaf fleas on the snow cover during late winter and
you were. The species found in these studies were fol-
jande: C. corcontum, C. elegantula (férkommer
especially in northern Sweden), C. palmeni (common
in Norway, occurs in northern Sweden), C. brun-
neipennis, B. femoralis, B. curvatinervis, B.
striola and T. urticae. It thus appears that
the Swedish and Norwegian species composition
coincides for some species during the time period
November to March (Tab. 2). The Norwegian sub-
the sequencing can be further summarized briefly
with the following interesting results: Population-

this time period. During the period March to April
the Swede-wintering animals began to become active, despite
the temperature was often around 0. Also below
calm and windless conditions
in the country you could find animals directly on the snow
It was quite clear that the animals of their own activity
had let go of his grip on his winter worth. It was
easy to observe the animals when the examination area
it was snowy both in March and April. At
by this time, however, the virgin plants had not developed
its leaves. The question is why the leaf fleas stick
their winter hosts before the host plants are in their
folded stage? Some clear answer to this
is not found in the Norwegian work. Thanks
